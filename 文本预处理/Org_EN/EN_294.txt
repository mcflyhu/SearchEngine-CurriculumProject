What happened that night seemed like a dream to Dorothy Accustomed to think of others and to forget herself she pondered long and earnestly over the grief that Viola had shown Surely there was some strange influence between mother and daughter Dorothy remembered the looks akin to adoration that Mrs Green continually gave her daughter that day in the train Viola had certainly done an imprudent thing in telling the story Dorothy had no idea it was more than imprudent neither did she know how seriously that act had affected herself Even now as she tried to grasp the entire situation it never occurred to her that this was the story that stood between her and the friendship of the Glenwood girls For the time that unpleasant affair was almost forgotten this new problem was enough to wrestle with Early the next morning Mrs Pangborn sent for Dorothy The president s appearance immediately struck the girl as different she was in mourning I hope you have not lost a dear friend said Dorothy impulsively before Mrs Pangborn had addressed her Yes Dorothy she replied I have lost my father There was no show of emotion but the girl saw that no grief could be keener I am so sorry said Dorothy Yes my dear I am sure you are And your father knew him well They were very old friends I have heard him speak of Mr Stevens Yes I suppose you have Well his troubles are over I hope But Dorothy I sent to ask you about that story some of the young ladies have been circulating about you Of course it is all nonsense What story have you reference to Mrs Pangborn You must have heard it That you and Octavia were seen getting out of a police patrol wagon in Dalton It is absurd of course But we did ride in a patrol wagon Mrs Pangborn answered Dorothy trying hard to keep Viola s tearful face before her mind to guide her in her statements How foolish child It might have been a joke Tell me about it If you would excuse me Mrs Pangborn and not think me rude I would rather not said Dorothy her cheeks aflame Not tell me and the lady raised her eyebrows Why Dorothy Is there any good reason why you do not wish to tell me Yes I have made a promise It may not be of much account but if you will excuse me it would relieve me greatly not to go over it Mrs Pangborn did not answer at once For a girl to admit she had ridden in a police van and for that girl to be Dorothy Dale It seemed incredible Dorothy she began gravely whatever may be back of this I am sure you have not been at fault seriously at least And since you prefer not to make me your confidant I cannot force you to do so I am sorry I had expected something different The young ladies will scarcely make apologies to you under the circumstances She made a motion as if to dismiss Dorothy Plainly the head of Glenwood School could not be expected to plead with a pupil certainly not to day when her new and poignant grief could not be hidden I shall say to the young ladies said the teacher finally that they are to show you all the respect they had shown you heretofore That you have done nothing to be ashamed of I am sure of this although you make the matter so mysterious I would like to have compelled the girl who spread this report to make amends but I cannot do that You do not deny her story At that moment Dorothy saw or at least guessed what it all meant That had been the story of her trouble It was that which made the girls turn their backs on her that which had almost broken her heart And now she had put it out of her power to contradict their charges Mrs Pangborn had said good morning Dorothy was alone in the corridor She had left the office and could not now turn back Oh why had she been so easily deceived Why had Viola made her give that promise Surely it must have been more than that The story to cause all the girls to shun her And perhaps Mrs Pangborn believed it all No she had refused to believe it But what should Dorothy do now Oh what a wretched girl she was How much it had cost her to lose Tavia Tavia would have righted this wrong long ago But now she stood alone She could not even speak of leaving the school without strengthening the cruel suspicion whatever it might be What would she
