Within a few hours after O Reilly s return to New York he telephoned to Felipe Alvarado explaining briefly the disastrous failure of his Cuban trip I feared as much the doctor told him You were lucky to escape with your life Well I m going back Of course but have you made any plans Not yet I dare say I ll have to join some filibustering outfit Won t you intercede for me with the Junta They re constantly sending parties Um m not quite so often as that Alvarado was silent for a moment then he said Dine with me to night and we ll talk it over I m eager for news of my brothers and there is some one I wish you to meet She is interested in our cause She A woman Yes and an unusual woman She has contributed liberally to our cause I would like you to meet her Very well but I ve only one suit of clothes and it looks as if I d slept in it Oh bother the clothes laughed the physician I ve given most of mine to my destitute countrymen Don t expect too much to eat either every extra dollar you know goes the same way as my extra trousers It will be a sort of patriotic poverty party Come at seven please Dining out eh Lucky devil said Leslie Branch when he had learned of his companion s invitation And to meet a philanthropic old lady Gee Maybe she ll offer to adopt you Who knows I wish you d offer to lend me a clean shirt I ll do it readily agreed the other I ll stake you to my last one But keep it clean Have a care for the cuffs a little inadvertency with the soup may ruin my prospects for a job You understand don t you that our next meal after this one may depend upon this shirt s prosperous appearance Branch dove into his bag and emerged with a stiffly laundered shirt done up in a Cuban newspaper He unwrapped the garment and gazed fondly upon it murmuring Tis a pretty thing is it not His exertions had brought on a violent coughing spell which left him weak and gasping but when he had regained his breath he went on in the same key Again I solemnly warn you that this spotless bosom is our bulwark against poverty One stain may cut down my space rates editors are an infernally fastidious lot Fortunately they want facts about the war in Cuba and I m full of em I ve fought in the trenches and heard the song of grape and canister Grape fruit and canned goods you mean O Reilly grinned Well I shall write with both in mind The hope of one will stir memories of the other And who is there to dispute me At least I know what a battle should be like and I shall thrill my readers with imaginary combats O Reilly eyed the speaker with appreciation On the way north he had learned to know Leslie Branch and to like him for he had discovered that the man possessed a rare and pleasing peculiarity of disposition Ordinarily Branch was bitter irritable pessimistic but when his luck was worst and his fortunes lowest he brightened up It seemed that he reacted naturally automatically against misfortune Certainly his and O Reilly s plight upon leaving Cuba had been sufficiently unpleasant for they were almost penniless and the invalid moreover knew that he was facing a probably fatal climate nevertheless once they were at sea he had ceased his grumbling and had surprised his traveling companion by assuming a genuinely cheerful mien Even yet O Reilly was not over his amazement he could not make up his mind whether the man was animated by desperate courage or merely by hopeless resignation But whatever the truth the effect of this typical perversity had been most agreeable And when Leslie cheerfully volunteered to share the proceeds of his newspaper work during their stay in New York thus enabling his friend to seize the first chance of returning to Cuba Johnnie s affection for him was cemented But Branch s very cheerfulness worried him it seemed to betoken that the fellow was sicker than he would confess That evening O Reilly anticipated his dinner engagement by a few moments in order to have a word alone with Alvarado I ve seen Enriquez he told the doctor but he won t promise to send me through He says the Junta is besieged by fellows who want to fight for Cuba and of course I don t When I appealed in Rosa s name he told me truthfully enough I dare say that there are thousands of Cuban women as badly in need of succor as she He says this is no time for private considerations Quite so the doctor agreed We hear frightful stories about this new concentration policy I can t believe them Oh I guess they are true it is the more reason why I must get back at once O Reilly said earnestly This lady who is coming here to night has influence with Enriquez You remember I told you that she has contributed liberally She might help you I ll implore her to put in a word for me Who is she Well she s my pet nurse A nurse O Reilly s eyes opened wide A nurse with MONEY I didn t know there was such a thing Neither did I They re rarer even than rich doctors Alvarado acknowledged But you see nursing is merely Miss Evans s avocation She s one of the few wealthy women I know who have real ideals and live up to them Oh she has a mission Johnnie s interest in Doctor Alvarado s other guest suddenly fell away and his tone indicated as much As the doctor was about to reply the ringing of the door bell summoned him away O Reilly had met women with ideals with purposes with avocations and his opinion of them was low Women who had missions were always tiresome he had discovered This one it appeared was unusual only in that she had adopted a particularly exacting form of charitable work Nursing even as a rich woman s diversion must be anything but agreeable O Reilly pictured this Evans person in his mind a large plain elderly creature obsessed with impractical ideas of uplifting the masses She would undoubtedly bore him stiff with stories of her work she would reproach him with neglect of his duties to the suffering Johnnie was too poor to be charitable and too deeply engrossed at the moment with his own troubles to care anything whatever about the masses And she was a miss That meant that she wore thick glasses and probably kept cats A ringing laugh from the cramped hallway interrupted these reflections then a moment later Doctor Alvarado was introducing O Reilly to a young woman so completely out of the picture so utterly the opposite of his preconceived notions that he was momentarily at a loss Johnnie found himself looking into a pair of frank gray eyes and felt his hand seized by a firm almost masculine grasp Miss Evans according to his first dazzling impression was about the most fetching creature he had ever seen and about the last person by whom any young man could be bored If she kept cats they must be pedigreed Persian cats and well worth keeping Johnnie decided The girl and she was a girl had brought into the room an electric vitality a breeziness hard to describe Her eyes were humorous and intelligent her teeth which she seemed always ready to show in a friendly generous smile were strong and white and sparkling Altogether she was such a vision of healthy unaffected and smartly gotten up young womanhood that O Reilly could only stammer his acknowledgment of the introduction inwardly berating himself for his awkwardness He was aware of Alvarado s amusement and this added to his embarrassment The doctor has told me all about you Miss Evans addressed Johnnie over her shoulder as she laid off her furs and a stylish little turban hat I m dying to hear what happened on your trip So am I confessed Alvarado You know Mr O Reilly has seen my brothers You men must go right ahead and talk as if I weren t here I won t interrupt except with a few vivas or carambas or What are some other lady like Spanish exclamations There aren t very many Johnnie acknowledged I always try to swear in English Alvarado placed an affectionate hand upon Miss Evans s shoulder O Reilly this girl has done more for Cuba than any of us She has spent a small fortune for medical supplies said he Those poor men must live on quinine the girl exclaimed Any one who can bear to take the stuff ought to have all he wants I ve a perfect passion for giving pills Oh you may joke about it All the same if others would make the same sacrifice Miss Evans interrupted breezily It wasn t any sacrifice at all That s the worst of it The salve I bought was really for my conscience if you must know I squander altogether too much on myself Then turning to O Reilly I love extravagance don t you Dearly It s my one unconquerable vice he told her He thought grimly of the four dollars in his pocket which represented his and Leslie Branch s total wealth but it seemed to him that he was called upon to agree with anything Miss Evans might choose to say O Reilly liked this girl He had liked her the instant she favored him with her friendly smile and so trusting fatuously to his masculine powers of observation he tried to analyze her He could not guess her age for an expensive ladies tailor can baffle the most discriminating eye Certainly however she was not too old he had an idea that she would tell him her exact age if he asked her While he could not call her beautiful she was something immensely better she was alive human interesting and interested The fact that she did not take her mission over seriously proved that she was also sensible beyond most women Yes that was it Norine Evans was a perfectly sensible unspoiled young person who showed the admirable effects of clean living and clean thinking coupled with a normal sturdy constitution O Reilly told himself that here was a girl who could pour tea nurse a sick man or throw a baseball And she was as good as her promise She did not interrupt when during dinner Alvarado led Johnnie to talk about his latest experience in Cuba but on the contrary her unflagging interest induced O Reilly to address his talk more often to her than to the doctor He soon discovered that she understood the Cuban situation as well as or better than he and that her sympathies were keen When she did speak it was to ask intelligent questions some of which by the way it taxed O Reilly s wits to answer satisfactorily Heretofore Johnnie had looked upon the war primarily as an unfortunate condition of affairs which had played the mischief with his own personal fortunes he had not allowed himself to be very deeply affected by the rights or the wrongs of either party But Norine Evans took a much deeper and broader view of the matter She was genuinely moved by the gallant struggle of the Cuban people and when the dinner was over she exploded a surprise which left both men speechless This settles it with me she announced I m going down there Alvarado stared at her for a moment My dear he began But she warned him Don t argue with me You know I detest arguments I ve been thinking about it for some time and It is quite impossible the doctor declared firmly and O Reilly agreed Of course you could go to Havana said the latter but you wouldn t be allowed to see anything I m going right to the Insurrectos with you WITH ME O Reilly could not conceal his lack of enthusiasm I don t know that the Junta will take me They will if I ask them Alvarado inquired What ever put such a ridiculous idea into your head The girl laughed It s the only kind of ideas I have But there are ten thousand reasons why I want to go In the first place I fairly itch to give pills You say the rebels have no hospitals no nurses We do the best we can with our equipment Well I ll supply better equipment and I ll handle it myself I m in earnest You sha n t stop me O Reilly was uncomfortably aware of the speaker s determination protests had no effect upon her her clear cheeks had flushed her eyes were dancing Evidently here was a girl who did very much as she chose You don t realize what you are saying he told her gravely You d have to go as a filibuster on some decrepit unseaworthy freighter loaded to the guards and crowded with men of all sorts It s dangerous business running the Spanish blockade If captured you would be treated just like the rest of us Lovely We d land in small boats some dark night Maybe we d have a fight And if you got through what then Life in a bark hut with nothing to eat Bugs Snakes Hardships That decides me I eat too much Doctor Alvarado tells me I do I adore huts and I don t seriously object to insects The physician stirred uneasily It s utterly absurd he expostulated Some women might do it but you re not the sort You are pardon me a most attractive young person You d be thrown among rough men Mr O Reilly will look out for me But for that matter I can take care of myself Oh it s of no use trying to discourage me I always have my own way I m completely spoiled Your family will never consent O Reilly ventured whereupon Miss Evans laughed I haven t such a thing I m alone and unencumbered No girl was ever so fortunate But wait I ll settle this whole thing in a minute She quitted the table ran to Alvarado s telephone and called a number She s after Enriquez groaned the physician He s weak he can t refuse her anything I don t want a woman on my hands O Reilly whispered fiercely Suppose she got sick Good Lord I d have to NURSE her He wiped a sudden moisture from his brow Oh she won t get sick She ll probably nurse you and and all the other men You ll like it too and you will all fall in love with her everybody does and start fighting among yourselves There She has Enriquez Listen Johnnie shivered apprehensively at the directness with which Miss Evans put her request You understand I want to go and see for myself she was saying If you need medicines I ll give them bushels of the nastiest stuff I can buy I ll organize a field hospital Oh very well call it a bribe if you like Anyhow I ve fully determined to go and Mr O Reilly has volunteered to take care of me He s charmed with the idea Miss Evans giggled That means you ll have to take him along too There followed a pause during which the two men exchanged dismayed glances She doesn t seem to care what she says O Reilly murmured But I ll put a flea in Enriquez s ear Put it in writing please There was another wait Now read it to me Good Miss Evans fairly purred over the telephone Send it to me by messenger right away that s a dear I m at Doctor Alvarado s house and he s beside himself with joy Thanks awfully You re so nice A moment and she was back in the dining room facing her two friends a picture of triumph You have nothing more to say about it she gloated The Provisional Government of Cuba through its New York representatives extends to Miss Norine Evans an invitation to visit its temporary headquarters in the Sierra de something or other and deems it an honor to have her as its guest so long as she wishes to remain there It requests that all military and civil officers afford her every safety and convenience within their power That s practically what Mr Enriquez read to me In fifteen minutes it will be here in black and white Now then let s celebrate She executed a dance step pirouetted around the room then plumped herself down into her chair She rattled her cup and saucer noisily crying Fill them up Doctor Gloom Let s drink to Cuba Libre Johnnie managed to smile as he raised his demi tasse Here s to my success as a chaperon said he I m disliked by the Spaniards and now the Cubans will hate me
