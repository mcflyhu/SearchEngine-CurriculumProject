Mrs Buss had surrendered at last to Eve s persuasions and a jobbing carpenter had erected a section built shed in the back garden at Bosnia Road The shed had a corrugated iron roof and Mrs Buss had stipulated that the roof should be painted a dull red so that it might tone with the red brick houses The studio was lined with matchboarding had a skylight in the roof and was fitted with an anthracite stove The whole affair cost Eve about twenty five pounds with an additional two shillings added to the weekly rent of her rooms She paid for the studio out of the money she had received from the sale of the furniture at Orchards Corner and her capital had now dwindled to about forty five pounds Every morning on her way towards Highbury Corner Eve passed the end of Clarendon Grove a road lined with sombre semi detached houses whose front gardens were full of plane trees ragged lilacs and privets and scraggy laburnums Eve who was fairly punctual passed the end of Clarendon Grove about a quarter to nine each morning and there was another person who was just as punctual in quite a detached and unpremeditated way Sometimes she saw him coming out of a gate about a hundred yards down Clarendon Grove sometimes he was already turning the corner or she saw his broad fat back just ahead of her always on the same side of the street She christened him the Highbury Clock or the British Bourgeois He was a shortish square built man of about five and forty with clumsy shoulders a round head and big feet He turned his toes out like a German when he walked and he always went at the same pace and always carried a black handbag His face was round phlegmatic good tempered and wholly commonplace the eyes blue and rather protuberant the nose approximating to what is vulgarly called the shoe horn type the mouth hidden by a brownish walrus moustache He looked the most regular reliable and solid person imaginable in his top hat black coat and neatly pressed grey trousers Eve never caught him hurrying and she imagined that in hot weather he ought to wear an alpaca coat They sighted each other pretty regularly for some three months before chance caused them to strike up a casual acquaintanceship One wet day the Bourgeois gave up his seat to Eve in a crowded tram After that he took off his hat to her whenever she happened to pass across the end of Clarendon Grove in front of him One morning they arrived at the corner at the same moment and the Bourgeois wished her good morning They walked as far as Upper Street together It seemed absurd for two humans whose paths touched so often not to smile and exchange a few words about the weather and so it came about that they joined forces whenever the Bourgeois was near enough to the corner for Eve not to have to indulge in any conscious loitering He was a very decent sort of man and his name was Mr Parfit He was something in the neighbourhood of Broad Street but what it was he did not state and Eve did not inquire In due course she discovered that he was a bachelor that he had lived for fifteen years in the same rooms that he had a passion for romantic novels and that he went regularly to Queen s Hall He spent Sunday in his slippers reading The Referee A three weeks holiday once a year satisfied any vagrant impulses he might feel and he spent these three weeks at Ramsgate Hastings or Brighton I like to be in a crowd he told Eve with plenty of youngsters about There s nothing I like better than sitting on the sands with a pipe and a paper watching the kids making castles and pies and listening to Punch and Judy Seems to make one feel young She liked Mr Parfit and often wondered why he had not married Perhaps he was one of those men who preferred being a very excellent uncle rather than a bored father for she gathered that he was fond of other people s children and was always ready with his pennies He had a sly laborious porcine humour and a chuckle that made his cheeks wrinkle and his eyes grow smaller He was exceedingly polite to Eve and though at times he seemed inclined to be good naturedly personal she knew that it was part of his nature and not a studied attempt at familiarity Eve was glad to have this very human person to talk to for she found life increasingly lonely now that Kate Duveen had gone Mr Parfit had a fatherly way with him and though his culture was crude and raw he had a shrewd outlook upon things in general that was not unamusing London too was in the thick of the mud and muck of a wet winter and Eve found that she was growing more susceptible to the depressing influence of bad weather It spoilt her morning s walk and caused a quite unnecessary expenditure on trams and buses and roused her to a kind of rage when she pulled up her blind in the morning and saw the usual drizzle making the slate roofs glisten She associated her new studio with rain for there always seemed to be a pattering sound upon the corrugated iron roof when she shut herself in to work She grew more moody and her moodiness drove her into desperate little dissipations such as a seat in the upper circle at His Majesty s or the Haymarket a dinner at an Italian restaurant or a tea at Fuller s She found London less depressing after dark and learnt to understand how the exotic city with its night jewels glittering appealed to people who were weary of greyness Her sun hunger and her country hunger had become so importunate that she had spent one Sunday in the country taking train to Guildford and walking up to the Hog s Back The Surrey hills had seemed dim and sad and away yonder she had imagined Fernhill with its fir woods and its great pleasaunce She had felt rather like an outcast and the day had provoked such sadness in her that she went no more into the country The extraordinary loneliness of such a life as hers filled her at times with cynical amusement How absurd it was this crowded solitude of London this selfish suspicious careless materialism No one bothered More than once she felt whimsically tempted to catch some passing woman by the arm and to say Stop and talk to me I am human and I have a tongue After tea she would often loiter along Regent Street or Oxford Street looking rather aimlessly into the shops and studying the faces of the people who passed but she found that she had to abandon this habit of loitering for more than once men spoke to her looking in her face with a look that made her grow cold with a white anger It was inevitable that she should contrast this London life with the life at Fernhill and compare all other men with James Canterton She could not help making the comparison nor did the comparison when made help her to forget The summer had given her her first great experience and all this subsequent loneliness intensified the vividness of her memories She yearned to see Lynette to feel the child s warm hands touching her She longed too for Canterton to be able to look into his steady eyes to feel his clean strength near her to realise that she was not alone Yes he was clean while these men who passed her in the streets seemed horrible greedy and pitiless They reminded her of the people in Aubrey Beardsley s drawings people with grotesque and leering faces out of whose eyes nameless sins escaped The flat in Purbeck Street offered her other contrasts after the rain and the wet streets and the spattering mud from the wheels of motor buses It was eccentric but unwholesome luxurious and effeminate with suggestions of an extreme culture and an individual idea of beauty Coming straight from a cheap lunch eaten off a marble topped table to this muffled scented room was like passing from a colliery slum to a warm and scented bath in a Roman villa Eve noticed that her shoes always seemed muddy and she laughed over it and apologised I always leave marks on your white carpet You should read Baudelaire in order to realise that a thing that is white is of no value without a few symbolical stains Supposing I have a glass case put over one of your footprints so that Adolf shall not wash them all away That was just what she disliked about Hugh Massinger He was for ever twisting what she said into an excuse for insinuating that he found her charming and provocative He did not play at gallantry like a gentleman A circuitous cleverness and a natural cowardliness kept him from being audaciously frank He fawned like a badly bred dog and she liked his fawnings so little that she began to wonder at last whether this fool was in any way serious One morning it snowed hard before breakfast for about an hour and by one o clock London was a city of slush Eve felt depressed and her shoes and stockings and the bottom of her skirt were sodden when she reached the flat in Purbeck Street Adolf smiled his usual smile and confessed that Mr Massinger had not expected her Ma Donna I never thought you would brave this horrible weather He threw a book aside and was up solicitous and not a little pleased at the chance of being tender I suppose English weather is part of the irony of life Good heavens Your shoes and skirt are wet A little He piled two or three cushions in front of the fire Do sit down and take your shoes and stockings off and dry your skirt She sat down and took off her shoes Stockings too I can be very fatherly and severe Do you think it immodest to show your bare feet You must have a liqueur it will warm you I would rather not Oh come You are a pale Iseult to day Thank you I would rather not Then Adolf shall make us coffee He rang the bell Adolf coffee and some biscuits And bring that purple scarf of mine The scarf arrived first and Massinger held it spread over his hands like a shop assistant showing off a length of silk Two little white empresses shall wear the purple No work this afternoon I am going to try to make you forget the weather Adolf came in noiselessly with the coffee set it on a stool beside Eve and departed just as noiselessly and with an absolutely expressionless face The way he had of effacing himself made Eve more conscious of his existence The fire was comforting so was the coffee She could have slipped into a mood of soothed indolence if Massinger had not been present But his leering obsequiousness had disturbed her and she found herself facing that eternal problem as to how a woman should behave to a man who employed her and paid for her time Was it necessary to quarrel with all this sentimental by play She still held to her impression that he was a very great ass This detestable climate It brutalises us It makes one understand why the English drink beer and love to see the red corpses of animals hung up in shops A gross climate and a gross people Eve had wrapped the purple scarf round her feet If we could be sure of a little sunshine every other day She was staring at the fire and Massinger was studying her with an interested intentness Thought and desire were mingled at the back of his pale eyes Sunshine clear yellow light Don t you yearn for it Who does not With the exception of the people who have been baked in the tropics And it is so near The people who are free can always find it He lay back against the cushions on the lounge his eyes still on her and shining with an incipient smile You leave the grey country at dusk and travel through the night and then the dawn comes up all orange and gold and the cypresses hold up their beckoning fingers There the sea is blue and there are flowers roses carnations wallflowers stocks and mimosa oranges and lemons hang on the trees and the white villas shine among palms and olives His voice became insinuating and took on its sing song blank verse cadence Have you ever seen Monte Carlo No It is a vulgar world to the vulgar But that delectable little world has an esoteric meaning The sun shines and it is easier to make love under a blue sky And then all those little towns on the edge of the blue sea and the grey rock villages and the adventures up mule paths Think of a mule path and pine woods and sunlight and a bottle of red wine She laughed but with a tremor of self consciousness It is useful to think of such things just to realise how very far away they are Nothing is far away when one has the magic carpet of gold Have the courage to dream and there you are He got up wandered round the room with a wavering glance at her and then came across to the fire Just think of Monte and the sunlight and the gay pagan life It is worth experiencing Dream of it for a week in London Are you getting dry He went down suddenly on one knee and felt her skirt and in another moment he had touched one of her feet The little white empress is warm How would she like to walk the terraces at Monte Carlo Eve kept very still She had an abrupt glimpse of the meaning of his suggestions and of all that was moving towards her in this man s mind Intuition told her that she would rebuff him more thoroughly by treating him as a sentimental idiot than by flattening him with anger as if he were a man Please don t do that It s foolish and makes me want to laugh I think it s time we were serious I am ready for work For an instant his eyes looked sulky and dangerous What a practical person it is And what a long time you have taken to find that out I m afraid I m not in the least sentimental Hugh
