Peter went back to the Palazzo Amadeo and said to Hilary who was writing an article for The Gem in the saloon I wouldn t go on with that Hilary It s no use The flatness of his voice the pallor of his face startled Hilary and Peggy Peggy said You re tired to death child Take the big chair Hilary said How do you mean no use And Peter told him While he did so he stood at the window looking down at the canal between the green shutters that swung ajar and did not look at Hilary s face It was an impossible position for Hilary so utterly impossible that it was no use trying to make the best of it one could only look away and get through it quickly Peter didn t say much He only said We ve been found out That man who came to you this afternoon was a spy sent by Cheriton He reported the result of his interview with you and Lord Evelyn knows all about everything Cheriton suspected from the first you see From what Lord Evelyn said I gather he means to prosecute He is very angry indeed They all are On the last statement Peter s voice sank a little in pitch so that they hardly heard it But the last statement mattered to no one but Peter Hilary had got up sharply at the first words and stood very still to listen letting out one long breath of weary despair Peggy came and stood close to him and took one slim white hand in her large kind ones and gently held it The fat was indeed in the fire Poor old Hilary How he would feel it Peggy divined that what stung Hilary most deeply at the moment was Peter s discovery of his faithlessness It was of that that his first shamed incoherent words were What was I to do How could I break abruptly with the old methods as you suggested It had to come gradually You know nothing of business Peter nothing His voice ran up the scale of protesting self defence Nothing Peter admitted drearily Hilary s shame before him could hardly now add to the badness of the situation as it had once done the badness of situations has a limit and this one had reached its limit some three hours since just before he had laughed in Lord Evelyn s drawing room Oh said Peter very tired suddenly never mind me what does that matter The point is well you see the point naturally Yes Hilary saw the point With a faint groan he ran his fingers through his hair and began to pace up and down the room in agitation He said That brute Cheriton An execrable bounder I always knew it What right had he It s too horrible too abominable Just when we were doing our best to get the thing onto straight lines He wheeled about and paced back again with quick uneven steps Between him and the motionless Peter Peggy stood looking from one to the other Her merry eyes were quite grave now The situation was certainly appalling We must leave Venice said Peggy on a sigh That seemed certainly the only thing to be done Hilary groaned again Oh Lord what are we let in for What will be the result if he prosecutes It may be utter ruin I know nothing of these things Of course in justice nothing could be done to us for after all what harm have we done Anyone may insert advertisements for pay and it only amounted to that But justice isn t taken into much account in the law courts It is a horrible cast iron system the relic of a barbarous age I don t know what we mayn t be in for or how we shall come out of it You don t know either Peter you know nothing of law nothing It mustn t come into court that is unthinkable We will make full apologies any restitution within our power that Lord Evelyn demands I shall go there I shall see him about it and appeal to his better feelings He has been a friend of mine He has always been good to you Peter The memory of your mother Appeal to that You must go to him and see what can be done Yes it had better be you he has a kinder feeling for you I believe than for me He has no kind feeling for me said Peter dully He is more annoyed with me than with you Hilary jerked his head impatiently Nonsense You want to shirk you want to leave me to get out of the mess for myself Oh of course you re not legally involved I am aware of that you can leave the sinking ship if you choose and save yourself Peggy said Don t be ridiculous darling Peter s doing his best for us as he always has and came and stood at her brother in law s side kind and big and comforting with a hand on his arm Hilary went on querulously I m asking Peter to do a simple thing to use his friendship with the Urquharts to help me out of this mess If you don t want to see Lord Evelyn Peter you can go to Denis He s a friend of yours he s he s your kind of step brother You can easily persuade him to get the thing hushed up You ve always pretended that he was a friend of yours Go and see him then for heaven s sake and help us all out of this miserable predicament Peter was still silent staring down at the dark ribbon of shining water that lapped against two old brick walls a shut lane full of stars Peggy her hand on his arm said gently Oh Peter ll do his best for us of course he will won t you Peter Peter sighed very faintly into the dark night I will do anything I can naturally It won t be much you know You will go to the Urquharts to morrow morning and appeal to them said Hilary Yes said Peter I will do that Hilary breathed a sigh of relief and flung himself into a chair Thanks Peter I believe that is the best we can do You will persuade them at least to be just not to push the matter to unfair extremes Oh my God what a life His beautiful unhappy face was hidden in his hands he shuddered from head to foot feeling horribly sick The Margerison organism was sensitive Peggy bending over him drew caressing fingers through his dark hair and said Go to bed you poor old dear and don t worry any more to night Worry won t help now will it Bed said Hilary Bed What s the use of that I shouldn t sleep a wink I have a frightful head and I must go and find Vyvian and tell him Peggy sniffed Much Vyvian ll care He s been in bad odour all his life I should fancy One more row won t bother him much I wish it would it would be almost worth while to be upset if Guy Vyvian was going to be upset too the waster Well I wonder anyhow will this show that silly little Rhoda what sort of a creature she s been making a golden calf of Well go and wake Vyvian then darling and then come and tell me what he said to it Peter you re dropping to sleep as you stand Peter went to bed There didn t seem to be anything to stay up for and bed is a comforting friend on these occasions Hilary had a perverse tendency to sit up all night when the worst had happened and he had a frightful head Peter s way with life was more amenable he always took what comfort was offered him Bed is a good place it folds protecting consoling arms about you and gives at best oblivion at worst a blessed immunity from action In the morning about eleven o clock Peter went to the Ca delle Gemme That had to be done so it was no use delaying He asked for Lord Evelyn Urquhart and supposed that the servant who showed him in was astonished at his impudence However he was permitted to wait in the reception room while the servant went to acquaint Lord Evelyn with his presence He waited some time standing in the middle of the big room looking at some splinters of glass and china which had been left on the marble floor forming on his tongue what he was going to say He could form nothing that was easy to say honestly he didn t know whether when the door should open and that tall elegant fastidious figure should walk in he would find himself able to say anything at all He feared he might only grow hot and stammer and slink out But he pulled himself together he must do his best it was quite necessary He would try to say Lord Evelyn I know it is abominably impertinent of me to come into your house like this Will you forgive me this once I have come to ask you is there any consideration whatever any sort of reparation my brother and I can make which will be of any use as amends for what we did If so of course we should be grateful for the chance That was what he would try to say And what he would mean was Will you let Hilary off Will you let him just go away into obscurity without further disgrace Isn t he disgraced enough already Because you are kind and because you have been fond of me and because I ask you will you do this much And what the answer would be Peter had not the faintest idea To him personally the answer was indifferent From his point of view the worst had already happened and no further disgrace could affect him much But Hilary desperately cared so he must do his best he must walk into the fire and wrest out of it what he could And at last the door opened and Denis Urquhart came in He was just as usual leisurely and fair and tranquil only usually he smiled at Peter and to day he did not smile One might have fancied under his tranquillity a restrained nervousness He did not shake hands but then Peter and he never did shake hands when they met He said Sit down won t you My uncle isn t available just now so I have come instead You have something to say to him haven t you He sat down himself and waited looking at the splinters of glass on the floor Peter stood and his breath came shortly Yes he had something to say to Lord Evelyn but nothing to Lord Evelyn s nephew He grew hot and cold and stammered something he did not know what Yes said Denis in his soft casual voice politely expectant Peter who did not after all lack a certain desperate courage walked into the fire with braced will It was bad that Denis should be brought into the business but it had to be gone through all the same I only wanted to know to know what Lord Evelyn is going to do about this matter He jerked out the words like stones from a catapult Denis was silent for a moment He disliked being dragged into this revolting affair but he had had to come and see Peter since his uncle refused and he could not let Peter go unseen away He didn t want to see him ever again since he had behaved as he had behaved but neither did he want to violate the laws of courtesy and hospitality I don t quite know he said after a moment Is he does he intend to prosecute Peter asked blushing Denis answered to that at once I shall certainly do my best to prevent anything of the sort I don t think he will At present he is still very angry but I think when he cools down he will see reason To prosecute would be to make himself absurd he will see that no doubt He values his reputation as an art connoisseur you see At the faint cool irony in the words Peter winced Of course went on Denis lighting a cigarette your brother will leave Venice at once I suppose He passed Peter his cigarette box Peter refused it Naturally We mean to leave as soon as we can Thank you that is all I had to say Good bye Denis got up and Peter saw relief through the mask of politeness Good bye I needn t say how sorry I am about all this It was hard lines on you being brought into it He was making a transparent effort after friendliness Peter almost smiled at it Poor Denis what a relief it would be to him when the disreputable Margerisons were off the scenes Peter paused at the door and said in a low embarrassed voice Would you mind telling Lord Evelyn what I told him myself last night that I m horribly sorry about it sorrier than I have ever been for anything It won t make any difference to him I know but if you will just tell him And I m sorry it happened while you were here too You ve been dragged in Good bye Good bye Margerison Denis was grave embarrassed restrained and not unkind It was obvious that he had nothing to say about it all Peter left the Ca delle Gemme That afternoon Hilary received a note from Lord Evelyn It was to the effect that Lord Evelyn had decided not to bring an action on the understanding that Hilary and his brother and Vyvian left Venice at once and discontinued for ever the profession of artistic advisers If any of the three was discovered engaging again in that business those who employed them should promptly be advised of their antecedents They were in fact to consider themselves warned off the turf There was also to be a paragraph about them in the English art papers Well was Peggy s comment it hasn t been such a grand trade that we need mind much We ll all come back to England and keep a boarding house there instead and you shall paint the great pictures darling and have ever so much more fun And we ll never need to see that Vyvian again there s fine news for the babies anyhow And I will be relieved to get them away from the canals one of them would have been surely drowned before long In London they ll have only gutters Hilary who was looking tired and limp after a distressing night and day said What shall you do Peter I don t know said Peter I must find something I suppose Some sort of work you know He pronounced the word gingerly distastefully as if it were a curious unwonted one Perhaps I shall be able to get a post as door keeper somewhere in some museum you know or perhaps a theatre or the White City I ve always thought that might be amusing You wouldn t earn much that way Hilary said hopelessly Need one earn much Peter wondered then remembered how exceedingly little Hilary would be earning and that perhaps one need because of the babies Or perhaps I can get taken on as a clerk in some business he amended Or in a bank only I don t believe my sums or manners are good enough for a bank really Oh well I must see what I can squeeze into Perhaps Leslie can think of something And perhaps the Robinsons will interest themselves in me though they ll be even more disgusted at our downfall than they were when I took up my profession and they thought that perfectly idiotic They always do think we re perfectly idiotic and now they ll know we re something worse But they may help me to a job if I bother them enough Anyhow I ll be one of your boarders if I may You darling said Peggy beaming at him It ll give the house quite a different feeling if you re in it And how delighted the babies will be I believe we re going to have the fine time after all in spite of this bothersome business Hurrah for London and no mosquitoes And we ll be quite near a Catholic church the way the children ll be able to run in and out as they do here and not pick up heathen customs Why Hilary I m really pleased Peggy was splendid She was nearly always really pleased They started for England a week later In the course of that week two things happened One was that Leslie gave Peter the Berovieri goblet for his own You ve got to take it he said If you don t I shall give it back to the prince I ve no right to it I can t appreciate it properly Since I first saw you look at the thing I knew it was really yours Take it and keep it You won t let me do anything else for you but you shall let me do that Peter looked at it with wistful love His fingers lingered about its exquisiteness It will break he said My things do break Break and get lost and go with the dust Or thieves will break in and steal it I shan t be able to keep it I know I m such a bad hand at keeping things Well well have a try said Leslie So Peter took it and was glad It was his one link with the world of exquisiteness and new burnished joys out of which he was being thrust he would keep it if he could Leslie also said that he could get him a place in a business if he really wanted one I shall be extremely little use said Peter Extremely little Leslie agreed You d much better not try But if you must you must I m afraid I must said Peter So Leslie wrote letters about him and secured him a humble post in a warehouse Leslie was not going to return to England at present He was going a tour round the world Since Peter refused to accompany him he went alone There s no one else I can fancy hanging round me day and night he said I wanted you Margery the nickname fell from him with a clumsy pathos but if you won t you won t I shall acquire an abominable collection of objects without you to guide me but that can t be helped The other thing that happened was that Mrs Johnson fell suddenly ill and died Before she died she talked to Peter about Rhoda It s leaving of her as I can t bear she whispered All alone and unprotected like I can t leave her by herself in this heathen country I want to get her back to England But she s got no relatives there as ll do for her none you know as I should care to trust her to or as ud be really good to her And I m afraid of what ll come to the child without me I m afraid Mr Peter That man it gives me the creeps of nights to think of him comin after Rhoder when I m gone I m just frightened as he ll get her you know what Rhoder is like a soft wax candle that gets droopy and gives before his bold look he can do anythin with her And if he gets her he won t be good to her I know that He ll just break her and toss her away my little gal Oh what can I do Mr Peter to save that She was in great pain drops of sweat kept gathering on her forehead and rolling on to the pillow Peter took her hand that picked at the blanket May we try to take care of her he gently asked If she will come and stay with us in London it would be better than being alone among strangers wouldn t it She could get work near and live with us Peggy is fond of her you know we all are We would try to make her as happy as we could She smiled at him between laboured breaths God bless you dear Mr Peter I somehow thought as how you d be good to my little gal You are so sympathetic to everyone always Yes Rhoder shall do that I ll have her promise And that man you ll keep him off of her I will try said Peter I will do my very best Oh Lord oh dear Lord said Mrs Johnson the pain But it didn t last long for she died that night And four days later the boarding house was broken up and the Margerison family and Rhoda Johnson left Italy together Rhoda was very quiet and still and white She was terribly alone for her mother was gone and the man she loved was gone hurriedly without a word to her There remained the Margerisons Peter with his friendly smile and gentle companionableness Hilary worried and weary and hardly noticing her unobtrusive presence Silvio Caterina and Illuminato sucking gingerbread and tumbling off the rack and Peggy on whose
