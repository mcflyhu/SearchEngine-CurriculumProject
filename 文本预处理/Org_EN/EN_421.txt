Achilles came to the door of the shop and looked out A car had driven up to the sidewalk a rough racing machine with open sides and big wheels and the driver a big man in a white cap and rough linen suit was beckoning to him with his hand Achilles stepped across the walk and stood by the machine with quiet waiting face The man looked him over a little as if he owned him I want some fruit he said quickly oranges grapes anything His glance ran to the fruit on the stall Get me something quick and don t be all day His hand was fumbling for change I get you best oranges said Achilles He snapped open a paper bag and turned to the heaped up fruit Then his eye paused a boy was breaking through the crowd hatless breathless and calling him with swift gesture Achilles sprang forward What is it Alcie His eye was searching the crowd and his hand dropped to the boy s shoulder There they are gasped the boy There Achilles s eye gleamed down the street a little way off a car was wheeling out from the curb gathering speed Achilles s eyes flashed on it and swept the crowd and came back The man in the white cap by the curb was swearing softly He leaped with two steps from the panting car to the stall and began gathering up oranges Here he said Then he wheeled and saw the Greek fruit dealer flashing off in a car his car Here you he shouted But Achilles gave no heed and the boy urging him on from behind turned with swift smile He take your car he said he need that car But the white capped man pounced upon him and shook him by the shoulder watching his car that was threading fast in the crowded traffic He dropped the boy and his hand reached up signalling wildly for police a city service car sprang from the ground it seemed The white capped man leaped in and they were off honking the crowd heavy drays moved from before them with slow eternal wheel the white cap swore softly and leaned forward and urged and the dark Greek head bobbed far ahead along in the crowd the big grey racer gathering speed beneath Achilles was not thinking of the pursuit yelling behind him he had no thoughts only two eyes that held a car far in the distance and two hands that gripped the wheel and drove hard and prayed grimly If his eye lost that car It was turning now far ahead and his eye marked the place and held it fixed His car jolted and bumped Men swore and made way before him and noted the hatless head and looked behind and saw the police car and yelled aloud But no one saw him in time and he was not stopped He had reached the corner where the car disappeared from sight and he leaned forward with careful turn peering around the corner They were there yes He drove faster and the great ugly car lifted itself and flung forward and settled to long sliding gait The car ahead turned again in the whirling traffic and turned again But Achilles s eye did not lose its track and they were out in the open at last the plain stretching before them no turn to left or right and the machine Achilles drove had no equal in the country But Achilles did not know his machine Good or bad it must serve him and keep his men in sight but not too near not to frighten them They had turned now and were glancing back and they spoke quickly Then they looked again at the flying and hatless head and saw suddenly on behind it the service car leap softly around the corner into the white road They looked again and laughed They turned and dropped the matter Some damn fool with a stolen car racing n adj I was watching the racing on television last night The two racing drivers fenced for a chance to gain the lead linen n adj The worker is starching the linen Fine linen and cotton fabrics were known as well as wool beckoning adj v beckon An even more beautiful future is beckoning us on He saw a youth of great radiance beckoning to him fumbling n v If he actually managed to the ball instead of fumbling it with an off balance shot fumbling balance If he actually managed to secure the ball instead of fumbling it awkwardly an off balance shot fumbling off balance gasped v gasp She gasped at the wonderful view People gasped with admiration at the superb skill of the gymnasts curb n vt I could not curb my anger You must curb your daughter when you are in church gathering n He called on Mr White to speak at the gathering He is on the wing gathering material for his novels pounced v pounce As soon as I opened my mouth the teacher pounced on me The police pounced upon the thief jolted jolt The truck jolted and rattled over the rough ground She was jolted out of her reverie as the door opened noted adj The local hotel is noted for its good table Jim is noted for arriving late for work spoke n v speak They sourced the spoke nuts from our company The spokes of a wheel are the bars that connect the outer ring to the centre
