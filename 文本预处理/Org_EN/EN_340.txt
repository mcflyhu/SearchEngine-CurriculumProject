When Eve had left for Latimer the routine of Canterton s working day ran with the same purposefulness like a familiar path in a garden yet though the scene was the same the atmosphere seemed different even as a well known landscape may be glorified and rendered more mysterious by the light poured out from under the edge of a thunder cloud A peculiar tenderness a glamour of sensitiveness covered everything He was more alive to the beauty of the world about him and the blue hills seemed to hang like an enchantment on the edge of the horizon He felt both strangely boyish and richly mature Something had been renewed in him He was an Elizabethan a man of a wonderful new youth seeing strange lands rising out of the ocean his head full of a new splendour of words and a new majesty of emotions The old self in him seemed as young and fresh as the grass in spring His vitality was up with the birds at dawn The first two days were days of dreams The day s work was the same yet it passed with a peculiar pleasureableness as though there were soft music somewhere keeping a slow rhythm He was conscious of an added wonder of the immanence of something that had not taken material shape A richer light played upon the colours of the world about him He was conscious of the light but he did not realise its nature nor whence it came On the third day the weather changed and an absurd restlessness took possession of him Rain came in rushes out of a hurrying grey sky and the light and the warmth seemed to have gone out of the world Mysterious outlines took on a sharp distinctness Figures were no longer the glimmering shapes of an Arthurian dream Canterton became more conscious of the physical part of himself of appetites needs inclinations tendencies Something was hardening and taking shape He began to think more definitely of Eve at Latimer and she was no longer a mere radiance spreading itself over the routine of the day s work Was she comfortable at the old red faced George Was the weather interfering with her work Would she write to Lynette and would the letter have a word for him What a wonderful colour sense she had and what cunning in those fingers of hers He liked to remember that peculiar radiant look that tenderness in the eyes that came whenever she was stirred by something that was unusually beautiful It was like the look in the eyes of a mother or the light in the eyes of a woman who loved He had seen it when she was looking at Lynette Then quite suddenly he became conscious of a sense of loss He was unable to fix his attention on his work and his thoughts went drifting He felt lonely It was as though he had been asleep and dreaming and had wakened up suddenly hungry and restless and vaguely discontented Even Lynette s chatter was a spell cast about his thoughts Having created a heroine the child babbled of her and her fascinations and Canterton discovered a secret delight in hearing Lynette talk of Eve Carfax He could not utter the things that the child uttered and yet they seemed so inevitable and so true so charmingly and innocently intimate It brought Eve nearer showed her to him as a more radiant gracious laughing figure Lynette was an enchantress a siren and knew it not and Canterton s ears were open to her voice I wonder if my letter will come to day daddy Perhaps It s over two three days It ought to be a big letter A big letter for a little woman I wonder if she writes as beautifully as she paints Very likely And oh daddy will she be back for our garden party I think so Mother says I can t behave nicely at parties I shall go about with Miss Eve and I ll do just what she does Then I ought to behave very nicely oughtn t I Perfectly I do love Miss Eve daddy don t you We always agree Miss Pixie On the fourth day Lynette had her letter It came by the morning s post with a little devil in red and black ink dancing on the flap of the envelope Lynette had not received more than three letters in her life and the very address gave her a beautiful new thrill Miss Lynette Canterton Fernhill Basingford Surrey Lessons over she went rushing out in search of her father and after canvassing various under gardeners discovered him in a corner of the rose nursery Miss Eve s written daddy I knew she would Would you like to read it Here s a message for you He sat down on a wooden bench and drawing Lynette into the hollow of one arm took the letter in a big hand It was written on plain cream paper of a roughish texture with a little picture of the George Hotel penned in the right upper corner Eve s writing was the writing of the younger generation so different from the regular sloping characterless style of the feminine Victorians It was rather upright rather square picturesque in its originality and with a certain decorative distinctness that covered the sheet of paper with personal and intimate values Dear Lynette I am writing to you at a funny little table in a funny little window that looks out on Latimer Green It has been raining all day oh such rain like thousands of silver wires falling down straight out of the sky If you were here we would sit at the window and make pictures of the queer people all legs and umbrellas walking up and down the streets Here is the portrait of an umbrella going out for a walk on a nice pair of legs in brown gaiters There is an old raven in the garden here I tried to make friends with him but he pecked my ankles And they say he uses dreadful language Wicked old bird Here is a picture of him pretending to be asleep with one eye open waiting for some poor Puss Cat to come into the garden There is a nice old gardener who makes me tea in the afternoon but I don t like it so much as tea in the Wilderness I want to be back to see you in your new party frock next Friday I feel quite lonely without the Queen of the Fairies If you were here I would buy you such cakes at the little shop across the road Please tell Mr Canterton that the weather was very good to me the first two days and that I hope he will like the pictures that I have painted Good bye Lynette dear Much much love to you from Miss Eve Lynette was ecstatic Isn t it a lovely letter daddy And doesn t she write beautifully And it s all spelt just as if it were out of a book Canterton folded the letter with meditative leisureliness Quite a lovely letter I m going to put it away in my jewel case Jewel case We are getting proud It s only a work box really but I call it a jewel case I see Things are just what we choose to call them Canterton went about for the rest of the day with a picture of a dark haired woman with a sensitive face sitting at a white framed Georgian window and looking out upon Latimer Green where all the red tiled roofs were dull and wet and the rain rustled upon the foliage of the Latimer elms He could imagine Eve drawing those pen and ink sketches for Lynette with a glimmer of fun in her eyes and her lips smiling She was seventy miles away and yet He found himself wondering whether her thoughts had reached out to him while she was writing that letter to Lynette At Latimer the rain was the mere whim of a day a silver veil let down on the impulse and tossed aside again with equal capriciousness Eve was deep in the Latimer gardens painting from nine in the morning till six at night taking her lunch and tea with her and playing the gipsy under a blue sky Save for that one wet day the weather was perfect for studies of vivid sunlight and dense shadow Latimer Abbey set upon its hill side with the dense woods shutting out the north seemed to float in the very blue of the summer sky There was no one in residence and save for the gardeners Eve had the place to herself and was made to feel like a child in a fairy story who discovers some enchanted palace all silent and deserted yet kept beautiful by invisible hands As she sat painting in the upper Italian garden with its flagged walks statues brilliant parterres and fountains she could not escape from a sense of enchantment It was all so quiet and still and empty The old clock with its gilded face in the turret kept smiting the hours with a quaint muffled cry and with each striking of the hour she had a feeling that all the doors and windows of the great house would open and that gay ladies in flowered gowns and gentlemen in rich brocades would come gliding out on to the terrace Gay ghosts in panniers and coloured coats powdered patched fluttering fans and cocking swords quaint in their stilted stateliness The magic of the place seemed to flow into her work and perhaps there was too much mystery in the classic things she painted Some strange northern god had breathed upon the little sensuous pictures that should have suggested the gem like gardens of Pompeii Clipped yews and box trees glowing masses of mesembryanthemum and pelargonium orange trees in stone vases busts statues masks fountains and white basins all the brilliancy thereof refused to be merely sensuous and delightful There was something over it a spirituality a slight mistiness that softened the materialism Eve knew what she desired to paint and yet something bewitched her hands puzzled her made her dissatisified The Gothic spirit refused to be conjured refused to suffer this piece of brilliant formalism to remain untouched under the thinner blue of the northern sky Eve was puzzled She made sketch after sketch and yet was not satisfied Was it medi valism creeping in the ghosts of old monks moving round her and throwing the shadows of their frocks over a pagan mosaic Or was the confusing magic in her own brain or some underflow of feeling that welled up and disturbed her purpose Moreover she discovered that another personality had followed her to Latimer She felt as though Canterton were present standing behind her looking over her shoulder and watching her work She seemed to see things with his eyes that the work was his work and that it was not her personality alone that mattered The impression grew and became so vivid that it forced her from the mere contemplation of the colours and the outlines of the things before her to a subtle consciousness of the world within herself Why should she feel that he was always there at her elbow And yet the impression was so strong that she fancied that she had but to turn her head to see him to talk to him and to look into his eyes for sympathy and understanding She tried to shake the feeling off to shrug her shoulders at it and failed James Canterton was with her all the while she worked There was a second Italian garden at Latimer a recreation in the spirit of the garden of the Villa d Este at Tivoli a hill garden a world of terraces stone stairways shaded walks box hedges cypresses and cedars fountains cascades great water cisterns Here was more mystery deeper shadows a sadder note Eve was painting in the lower garden on the day following the rain when the lights were softer the foliage fresher the perfumes more pungent There was the noise of water everywhere The sunlight was more partial and more vague splashing into the open spaces hanging caught in the cypresses and cedars touching some marble shape or glittering upon the water in some pool Try as she would Eve felt less impersonal here than in the full sunlight of the upper garden That other spirit that had sent her to Latimer seemed to follow her up and down the moss grown stairways to walk with her through the shadows under the trees She was more conscious of Canterton than ever He was the great grave lord of the place watching her work with steady eyes compelling her to paint with a touch that was not all her own Sometimes the head gardener who had tea made for her in his cottage came and watched her painting and angled for a gossip He was a superior sort of ancient with a passion for unearthing the history of plants that had been introduced from distant countries Canterton s name came up and the old man found something to talk about I don t say as I m an envious chap but that s the sort of life as would have suited me Eve paused at her work Whose Why Mr Canterton s Miss You know Mr Canterton by name Know him by name I reckon I do Didn t he raise Eileen Purcell and Jem Gaunt and bring all those Chinese and Indian plants into the country and hybridise Mephistopheles Canterton It s a name to conjure with Eve felt an indefinable pleasure in listening to the fame of the man whose work she was learning to share for it was fame to be spoken of with delight by this old Latimer gardener Mr Canterton s writing a book is he Yes and I am painting some of the pictures for it Are you now I have a notion I should like that book Aye it should be a book The work of years Sure None of your cheap popular sixpenny amateur stuff It ll be what you call de lucks won t it Such things cost money Eve was silent a moment The old man was genuine enough and not touting Perhaps Mr Canterton would send you a copy You would appreciate it I ll give him your name No no though I thank you miss A good tool is worth its money I m not a man to get a good thing for nothing I reckon I ll buy that there book It won t be published for two or three years Oh I m in no hurry I m used to waiting for things to grow solid Sapwood ain t no use to anybody Eve had a desire to see the hill garden by moonlight and the head gardener was sympathetic We lock the big gate at dusk when his lordship s away But you come round at nine o clock to the postern by the dovecot and I ll let you in The hill garden s mood was suited to the full moon Eve had dreamt of such enchantments but had never seen them till that summer night There was not a cloud in the sky and the cypresses and cedars were like the black spires of a city The alleys and walks were tunnels of gloom Here and there a statue or a fountain glimmered and the great water cisterns were pools of ink reflecting the huge white disc of the moon Eve wandered to and fro along the moonlit walks and up and down the dim stairways The stillness was broken only by the splash of water and by the turret clock striking the quarters It was the night of her last day at Latimer She would be sorry to leave it and yet to morrow she would be at Fernhill Lynette s glowing head flashed into her thoughts and a rush of tenderness overtook her If life could be like the joyous eyes of the child if passion went no further if all problems remained at the age of seven How would Canterton like the pictures she had painted A thrill went through her and at the same time she felt that the garden was growing cold A sense of unrest ruffled the calm of the moonlit night She felt near to some big indefinable force on the edge of the sea vaguely afraid of she knew not what She would see him to morrow It was to be the day of the Fernhill garden party and she had promised Lynette that she would go She felt glad yet troubled half tempted to shirk the affair and to stay with her mother at Orchards Corner A week had passed and she could not escape from the knowledge that something had happened to her in that week Yet what an absurd drift of dreams was this that she was suffering The moonlight and the mystery were making her morbid and hypersensitive To morrow she would walk out into the sunlight and meet him face to face in the thick of a casual crowd All the web of self consciousness would fall away She would find herself talking to a big brown faced man with steady eyes and a steady head He was proof against such imaginings far too strong to let such fancies cloud his consciousness Moreover they were becoming real good friends and she imagined that she understood him She had been too much alone this week His magnificent and kindly sanity would make her laugh a
