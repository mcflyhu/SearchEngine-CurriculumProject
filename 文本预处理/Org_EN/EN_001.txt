For a right understanding of the life of my dear friend Charlotte Bront it appears to me more necessary in her case than in most others that the reader should be made acquainted with the peculiar forms of population and society amidst which her earliest years were passed and from which both her own and her sisters first impressions of human life must have been received I shall endeavour therefore before proceeding further with my work to present some idea of the character of the people of Haworth and the surrounding districts Even an inhabitant of the neighbouring county of Lancaster is struck by the peculiar force of character which the Yorkshiremen display This makes them interesting as a race while at the same time as individuals the remarkable degree of self sufficiency they possess gives them an air of independence rather apt to repel a stranger I use this expression self sufficiency in the largest sense Conscious of the strong sagacity and the dogged power of will which seem almost the birthright of the natives of the West Riding each man relies upon himself and seeks no help at the hands of his neighbour From rarely requiring the assistance of others he comes to doubt the power of bestowing it from the general success of his efforts he grows to depend upon them and to over esteem his own energy and power He belongs to that keen yet short sighted class who consider suspicion of all whose honesty is not proved as a sign of wisdom The practical qualities of a man are held in great respect but the want of faith in strangers and untried modes of action extends itself even to the manner in which the virtues are regarded and if they produce no immediate and tangible result they are rather put aside as unfit for this busy striving world especially if they are more of a passive than an active character The affections are strong and their foundations lie deep but they are not such affections seldom are wide spreading nor do they show themselves on the surface Indeed there is little display of any of the amenities of life among this wild rough population Their accost is curt their accent and tone of speech blunt and harsh Something of this may probably be attributed to the freedom of mountain air and of isolated hill side life something be derived from their rough Norse ancestry They have a quick perception of character and a keen sense of humour the dwellers among them must be prepared for certain uncomplimentary though most likely true observations pithily expressed Their feelings are not easily roused but their duration is lasting Hence there is much close friendship and faithful service and for a correct exemplification of the form in which the latter frequently appears I need only refer the reader of Wuthering Heights to the character of Joseph From the same cause come also enduring grudges in some cases amounting to hatred which occasionally has been bequeathed from generation to generation I remember Miss Bront once telling me that it was a saying round about Haworth Keep a stone in thy pocket seven year turn it and keep it seven year longer that it may be ever ready to thine hand when thine enemy draws near The West Riding men are sleuth hounds in pursuit of money Miss Bront related to my husband a curious instance illustrative of this eager desire for riches A man that she knew who was a small manufacturer had engaged in many local speculations which had always turned out well and thereby rendered him a person of some wealth He was rather past middle age when he bethought him of insuring his life and he had only just taken out his policy when he fell ill of an acute disease which was certain to end fatally in a very few days The doctor half hesitatingly revealed to him his hopeless state By jingo cried he rousing up at once into the old energy I shall do the insurance company I always was a lucky fellow These men are keen and shrewd faithful and persevering in following out a good purpose fell in tracking an evil one They are not emotional they are not easily made into either friends or enemies but once lovers or haters it is difficult to change their feeling They are a powerful race both in mind and body both for good and for evil The woollen manufacture was introduced into this district in the days of Edward III It is traditionally said that a colony of Flemings came over and settled in the West Riding to teach the inhabitants what to do with their wool The mixture of agricultural with manufacturing labour that ensued and prevailed in the West Riding up to a very recent period sounds pleasant enough at this distance of time when the classical impression is left and the details forgotten or only brought to light by those who explore the few remote parts of England where the custom still lingers The idea of the mistress and her maidens spinning at the great wheels while the master was abroad ploughing his fields or seeing after his flocks on the purple moors is very poetical to look back upon but when such life actually touches on our own days and we can hear particulars from the lips of those now living there come out details of coarseness of the uncouthness of the rustic mingled with the sharpness of the tradesman of irregularity and fierce lawlessness that rather mar the vision of pastoral innocence and simplicity Still as it is the exceptional and exaggerated characteristics of any period that leave the most vivid memory behind them it would be wrong and in my opinion faithless to conclude that such and such forms of society and modes of living were not best for the period when they prevailed although the abuses they may have led into and the gradual progress of the world have made it well that such ways and manners should pass away for ever and as preposterous to attempt to return to them as it would be for a man to return to the clothes of his childhood The patent granted to Alderman Cockayne and the further restrictions imposed by James I on the export of undyed woollen cloths met by a prohibition on the part of the States of Holland of the import of English dyed cloths injured the trade of the West Riding manufacturers considerably Their independence of character their dislike of authority and their strong powers of thought predisposed them to rebellion against the religious dictation of such men as Laud and the arbitrary rule of the Stuarts and the injury done by James and Charles to the trade by which they gained their bread made the great majority of them Commonwealth men I shall have occasion afterwards to give one or two instances of the warm feelings and extensive knowledge on subjects of both home and foreign politics existing at the present day in the villages lying west and east of the mountainous ridge that separates Yorkshire and Lancashire the inhabitants of which are of the same race and possess the same quality of character The descendants of many who served under Cromwell at Dunbar live on the same lands as their ancestors occupied then and perhaps there is no part of England where the traditional and fond recollections of the Commonwealth have lingered so long as in that inhabited by the woollen manufacturing population of the West Riding who had the restrictions taken off their trade by the Protector s admirable commercial policy I have it on good authority that not thirty years ago the phrase in Oliver s days was in common use to denote a time of unusual prosperity The class of Christian names prevalent in a district is one indication of the direction in which its tide of hero worship sets Grave enthusiasts in politics or religion perceive not the ludicrous side of those which they give to their children and some are to be found still in their infancy not a dozen miles from Haworth that will have to go through life as Lamartine Kossuth and Dembinsky And so there is a testimony to what I have said of the traditional feeling of the district in the fact that the Old Testament names in general use among the Puritans are yet the prevalent appellations in most Yorkshire families of middle or humble rank whatever their religious persuasion may be There are numerous records too that show the kindly way in which the ejected ministers were received by the gentry as well as by the poorer part of the inhabitants during the persecuting days of Charles II These little facts all testify to the old hereditary spirit of independence ready ever to resist authority which was conceived to be unjustly exercised that distinguishes the people of the West Riding to the present day The parish of Halifax touches that of Bradford in which the chapelry of Haworth is included and the nature of the ground in the two parishes is much the of the same wild and hilly description The abundance of coal and the number of mountain streams in the district make it highly favourable to manufactures and accordingly as I stated the inhabitants have for centuries been engaged in making cloth as well as in agricultural pursuits But the intercourse of trade failed for a long time to bring amenity and civilization into these outlying hamlets or widely scattered dwellings Mr Hunter in his Life of Oliver Heywood quotes a sentence out of a memorial of one James Rither living in the reign of Elizabeth which is partially true to this day They have no superior to court no civilities to practise a sour and sturdy humour is the consequence so that a stranger is shocked by a tone of defiance in every voice and an air of fierceness in every countenance Even now a stranger can hardly ask a question without receiving some crusty reply if indeed he receive any at all Sometimes the sour rudeness amounts to positive insult Yet if the foreigner takes all this churlishness good humouredly or as a matter of course and makes good any claim upon their latent kindliness and hospitality they are faithful and generous and thoroughly to be relied upon As a slight illustration of the roughness that pervades all classes in these out of the way villages I may relate a little adventure which happened to my husband and myself three years ago at Addingham From Penigent to Pendle Hill From Linton to Long Addingham And all that Craven coasts did tell c one of the places that sent forth its fighting men to the famous old battle of Flodden Field and a village not many miles from Haworth We were driving along the street when one of those ne er do weel lads who seem to have a kind of magnetic power for misfortunes having jumped into the stream that runs through the place just where all the broken glass and bottles are thrown staggered naked and nearly covered with blood into a cottage before us Besides receiving another bad cut in the arm he had completely laid open the artery and was in a fair way of bleeding to death which one of his relations comforted him by saying would be likely to save a deal o trouble When my husband had checked the effusion of blood with a strap that one of the bystanders unbuckled from his leg he asked if a surgeon had been sent for Yoi was the answer but we dunna think he ll come Why not He s owd yo seen and asthmatic and it s up hill My husband taking a boy for his guide drove as fast as he could to the surgeon s house which was about three quarters of a mile off and met the aunt of the wounded lad leaving it Is he coming inquired my husband Well he didna say he wouldna come But tell him the lad may bleed to death I did And what did he say Why only D n him what do I care It ended however in his sending one of his sons who though not brought up to the surgering trade was able to do what was necessary in the way of bandages and plasters The excuse made for the surgeon was that he was near eighty and getting a bit doited and had had a matter o twenty childer Among the most unmoved of the lookers on was the brother of the boy so badly hurt and while he was lying in a pool of blood on the flag floor and crying out how much his arm was warching his stoical relation stood coolly smoking his bit of black pipe and uttered not a single word of either sympathy or sorrow Forest customs existing in the fringes of dark wood which clothed the declivity of the hills on either side tended to brutalize the population until the middle of the seventeenth century Execution by beheading was performed in a summary way upon either men or women who were guilty of but very slight crimes and a dogged yet in some cases fine indifference to human life was thus generated The roads were so notoriously bad even up to the last thirty years that there was little communication between one village and another if the produce of industry could be conveyed at stated times to the cloth market of the district it was all that could be done and in lonely houses on the distant hill side or by the small magnates of secluded hamlets crimes might be committed almost unknown certainly without any great uprising of popular indignation calculated to bring down the strong arm of the law It must be remembered that in those days there was no rural constabulary and the few magistrates left to themselves and generally related to one another were most of them inclined to tolerate eccentricity and to wink at faults too much like their own Men hardly past middle life talk of the days of their youth spent in this part of the country when during the winter months they rode up to the saddle girths in mud when absolute business was the only reason for stirring beyond the precincts of home and when that business was conducted under a pressure of difficulties which they themselves borne along to Bradford market in a swift first class carriage can hardly believe to have been possible For instance one woollen manufacturer says that not five and twenty years ago he had to rise betimes to set off on a winter s morning in order to be at Bradford with the great waggon load of goods manufactured by his father this load was packed over night but in the morning there was a great gathering around it and flashing of lanterns and examination of horses feet before the ponderous waggon got under way and then some one had to go groping here and there on hands and knees and always sounding with a staff down the long steep slippery brow to find where the horses might tread safely until they reached the comparative easy going of the deep rutted main road People went on horseback over the upland moors following the tracks of the pack horses that carried the parcels baggage or goods from one town to another between which there did not happen to be a highway But in winter all such communication was impossible by reason of the snow which lay long and late on the bleak high ground I have known people who travelling by the mail coach over Blackstone Edge had been snowed up for a week or ten days at the little inn near the summit and obliged to spend both Christmas and New Year s Day there till the store of provisions laid in for the use of the landlord and his family falling short before the inroads of the unexpected visitors they had recourse to the turkeys geese and Yorkshire pies with which the coach was laden and even these were beginning to fail when a fortunate thaw released them from their prison Isolated as the hill villages may be they are in the world compared with the loneliness of the grey ancestral houses to be seen here and there in the dense hollows of the moors These dwellings are not large yet they are solid and roomy enough for the accommodation of those who live in them and to whom the surrounding estates belong The land has often been held by one family since the days of the Tudors the owners are in fact the remains of the old yeomanry small squires who are rapidly becoming extinct as a class from one of two causes Either the possessor falls into idle drinking habits and so is obliged eventually to sell his property or he finds if more shrewd and adventurous that the beck running down the mountain side or the minerals beneath his feet can be turned into a new source of wealth and leaving the old plodding life of a landowner with small capital he turns manufacturer or digs for coal or quarries for stone Still there are those remaining of this class dwellers in the lonely houses far away in the upland districts even at the present day who sufficiently indicate what strange eccentricity what wild strength of will nay even what unnatural power of crime was fostered by a mode of living in which a man seldom met his fellows and where public opinion was only a distant and inarticulate echo of some clearer voice sounding behind the sweeping horizon A solitary life cherishes mere fancies until they become manias And the powerful Yorkshire character which was scarcely tamed into subjection by all the contact it met with in busy town or crowded mart has before now broken out into strange wilfulness in the remoter districts A singular account was recently given me of a landowner living it is true on the Lancashire side of the hills but of the same blood and nature as the dwellers on the other who was supposed to be in the receipt of seven or eight hundred a year and whose house bore marks of handsome antiquity as if his forefathers had been for a long time people of consideration My informant was struck with the appearance of the place and proposed to the countryman who was accompanying him to go up to it and take a nearer inspection The reply was Yo d better not he d threap yo down th loan He s let fly at some folk s legs and let shot lodge in em afore now for going too near to his house And finding on closer inquiry that such was really the inhospitable custom of this moorland squire the gentleman gave up his purpose I believe that the savage yeoman is still living Another squire of more distinguished family and larger property one is thence led to imagine of better education but that does not always follow died at his house not many miles from Haworth only a few years ago His great amusement and occupation had been cock fighting When he was confined to his chamber with what he knew would be his last illness he had his cocks brought up there and watched the bloody battle from his bed As his mortal disease increased and it became impossible for him to turn so as to follow the combat he had looking glasses arranged in such a manner around and above him as he lay that he could still see the cocks fighting And in this manner he died These are merely instances of eccentricity compared to the tales of positive violence and crime that have occurred in these isolated dwellings which still linger in the memories of the old people of the district and some of which were doubtless familiar to the authors of Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall The amusements of the lower classes could hardly be expected to be more humane than those of the wealthy and better educated The gentleman who has kindly furnished me with some of the particulars I have given remembers the bull baitings at Rochdale not thirty years ago The bull was fastened by a chain or rope to a post in the river To increase the amount of water as well as to give their workpeople the opportunity of savage delight the masters were accustomed to stop their mills on the day when the sport took place The bull would sometimes wheel suddenly round so that the rope by which he was fastened swept those who had been careless enough to come within its range down into the water and the good people of Rochdale had the excitement of seeing one or two of their neighbours drowned as well as of witnessing the bull baited and the dogs torn and tossed The people of Haworth were not less strong and full of character than their neighbours on either side of the hills The village lies embedded in the moors between the two counties on the old road between Keighley and Colne About the middle of the last century it became famous in the religious world as the scene of the ministrations of the Rev William Grimshaw curate of Haworth for twenty years Before this time it is probable that the curates were of the same order as one Mr Nicholls a Yorkshire clergyman in the days immediately succeeding the Reformation who was much addicted to drinking and company keeping and used to say to his companions You must not heed me but when I am got three feet above the earth that was into the pulpit Mr Grimshaw s life was written by Newton Cowper s friend and from it may be gathered some curious particulars of the manner in which a rough population were swayed and governed by a man of deep convictions and strong earnestness of purpose It seems that he had not been in any way remarkable for religious zeal though he had led a moral life and been conscientious in fulfilling his parochial duties until a certain Sunday in September when the servant rising at five found her master already engaged in prayer she stated that after remaining in his chamber for some time he went to engage in religious exercises in the house of a parishioner then home again to pray thence still fasting to the church where as he was reading the second lesson he fell down and on his partial recovery had to be led from the church As he went out he spoke to the congregation and told them not to disperse as he had something to say to them and would return presently He was taken to the clerk s house and again became insensible His servant rubbed him to restore the circulation and when he was brought to himself he seemed in a great rapture and the first words he uttered were I have had a glorious vision from the third heaven He did not say what he had seen but returned into the church and began the service again at two in the afternoon and went on until seven From this time he devoted himself with the fervour of a Wesley and something of the fanaticism of a Whitfield to calling out a religious life among his parishioners They had been in the habit of playing at foot ball on Sunday using stones for this purpose and giving and receiving challenges from other parishes There were horse races held on the moors just above the village which were periodical sources of drunkenness and profligacy Scarcely a wedding took place without the rough amusement of foot races where the half naked runners were a scandal to all decent strangers The old custom of arvills or funeral feasts led to frequent pitched battles between the drunken mourners Such customs were the outward signs of the kind of people with whom Mr Grimshaw had to deal But by various means some of the most practical kind he wrought a great change in his parish In his preaching he was occasionally assisted by Wesley and Whitfield and at such times the little church proved much too small to hold the throng that poured in from distant villages or lonely moorland hamlets and frequently they were obliged to meet in the open air indeed there was not room enough in the church even for the communicants Mr Whitfield was once preaching in Haworth and made use of some such expression as that he hoped there was no need to say much to this congregation as they had sat under so pious and godly a minister for so many years whereupon Mr Grimshaw stood up in his place and said with a loud voice Oh sir for God s sake do not speak so I pray you do not flatter them I fear the greater part of them are going to hell with their eyes open But if they were so bound it was not for want of exertion on Mr Grimshaw s part to prevent them He used to preach twenty or thirty times a week in private houses If he perceived any one inattentive to his prayers he would stop and rebuke the offender and not go on till he saw every one on their knees He was very earnest in enforcing the strict observance of Sunday and would not even allow his parishioners to walk in the fields between services He sometimes gave out a very long Psalm tradition says the th and while it was being sung he left the reading desk and taking a horsewhip went into the public houses and flogged the loiterers into church They were swift who could escape the lash of the parson by sneaking out the back way He had strong health and an active body and rode far and wide over the hills awakening those who had previously had no sense of religion To save time and be no charge to the families at whose houses he held his prayer meetings he carried his provisions with him all the food he took in the day on such occasions consisting simply of a piece of bread and butter or dry bread and a raw onion The horse races were justly objectionable to Mr Grimshaw they attracted numbers of profligate people to Haworth and brought a match to the combustible materials of the place only too ready to blaze out into wickedness The story is that he tried all means of persuasion and even intimidation to have the races discontinued but in vain At length in despair he prayed with such fervour of earnestness that the rain came down in torrents and deluged the ground so that there was no footing for man or beast even if the multitude had been willing to stand such a flood let down from above And so Haworth races were stopped and have never been resumed to this day Even now the memory of this good man is held in reverence and his faithful ministrations and real virtues are one of the boasts of the parish But after his time I fear there was a falling back into the wild rough heathen ways from which he had pulled them up as it were by the passionate force of his individual character He had built a chapel for the Wesleyan Methodists and not very long after the Baptists established themselves in a place of worship Indeed as Dr Whitaker says the people of this district are strong religionists only fifty years ago their religion did not work down into their lives Half that length of time back the code of morals seemed to be formed upon that of their Norse ancestors Revenge was handed down from father to son as an hereditary duty and a great capability for drinking without the head being affected was considered as one of the manly virtues The games of foot ball on Sundays with the challenges to the neighbouring parishes were resumed bringing in an influx of riotous strangers to fill the public houses and make the more sober minded inhabitants long for good Mr Grimshaw s stout arm and ready horsewhip The old custom of arvills was as prevalent as ever The sexton standing at the foot of the open grave announced that the arvill would be held at the Black Bull or whatever public house might be fixed upon by the friends of the dead and thither the mourners and their acquaintances repaired The origin of the custom had been the necessity of furnishing some refreshment for those who came from a distance to pay the last mark of respect to a friend In the life of Oliver Heywood there are two quotations which show what sort of food was provided for arvills in quiet Nonconformist connections in the seventeenth century the first from Thoresby tells of cold possets stewed prunes cake and cheese as being the arvill after Oliver Heywood s funeral The second gives as rather shabby according to the notion of the times nothing but a bit of cake draught of wine piece of rosemary and pair of gloves But the arvills at Haworth were often far more jovial doings Among the poor the mourners were only expected to provide a kind of spiced roll for each person and the expense of the liquors rum or ale or a mixture of both called dog s nose was generally defrayed by each guest placing some money on a plate set in the middle of the table Richer people would order a dinner for their friends At the funeral of Mr Charnock the next successor but one to Mr Grimshaw in the incumbency above eighty people were bid to the arvill and the price of the feast was s d per head all of which was defrayed by the friends of the deceased As few shirked their liquor there were very frequently up and down fights before the close of the day sometimes with the horrid additions of pawsing and gouging and biting Although I have dwelt on the exceptional traits in the characteristics of these stalwart West Ridingers such as they were in the first quarter of this century if not a few years later I have little doubt that in the everyday life of the people so independent wilful and full of grim humour there would be much found even at present that would shock those accustomed only to the local manners of the south and in return I suspect the shrewd sagacious energetic Yorkshireman would hold such foreigners in no small contempt I have said it is most probable that where Haworth Church now stands there was once an ancient field kirk or oratory It occupied the third or lowest class of ecclesiastical structures according to the Saxon law and had no right of sepulture or administration of sacraments It was so called because it was built without enclosure and open to the adjoining fields or moors The founder according to the laws of Edgar was bound without subtracting from his tithes to maintain the ministering priest out of the remaining nine parts of his income After the Reformation the right of choosing their clergyman at any of those chapels of ease which had formerly been field kirks was vested in the freeholders and trustees subject to the approval of the vicar of the parish But owing to some negligence this right has been lost to the freeholders and trustees at Haworth ever since the days of Archbishop Sharp and the power of choosing a minister has lapsed into the hands of the Vicar of Bradford So runs the account according to one authority Mr Bront says This living has for its patrons the Vicar of Bradford and certain trustees My predecessor took the living with the consent of the Vicar of Bradford but in opposition to the trustees in consequence of which he was so opposed that after only three weeks possession he was compelled to resign A Yorkshire gentleman who has kindly sent me some additional information on this subject since the second edition of my work was published write thus The sole right of presentation to the incumbency of Haworth is vested in the Vicar of Bradford He only can present The funds however from which the clergyman s stipend mainly proceeds are vested in the hands of trustees who have the power to withhold them if a nominee is sent of whom they disapprove On the decease of Mr Charnock the Vicar first tendered the preferment to Mr Bront and he went over to his expected cure He was told that towards himself they had no personal objection but as a nominee of the Vicar he would not be received He therefore retired with the declaration that if he could not come with the approval of the parish his ministry could not be useful Upon this the attempt was made to introduce Mr Redhead When Mr Redhead was repelled a fresh difficulty arose Some one must first move towards a settlement but a spirit being evoked which could not be allayed action became perplexing The matter had to be referred to some independent arbitrator and my father was the gentleman to whom each party turned its eye A meeting was convened and the business settled by the Vicar s conceding the choice to the trustees and the acceptance of the Vicar s presentation That choice forthwith fell on Mr Bront whose promptness and prudence had won their hearts In conversing on the character of the inhabitants of the West Riding with Dr Scoresby who had been for some time Vicar of Bradford he alluded to certain riotous transactions which had taken place at Haworth on the presentation of the living to Mr Redhead and said that there had been so much in the particulars indicative of the character of the people that he advised me to inquire into them I have accordingly done so and from the lips of some of the survivors among the actors and spectators I have learnt the means taken to eject the nominee of the Vicar The previous incumbent had been the Mr Charnock whom I have mentioned as next but one in succession to Mr Grimshaw He had a long illness which rendered him unable to discharge his duties without assistance and Mr Redhead gave him occasional help to the great satisfaction of the parishioners and was highly respected by them during Mr Charnock s lifetime But the case was entirely altered when at Mr Charnock s death in they conceived that the trustees had been unjustly deprived of their rights by the Vicar of Bradford who appointed Mr Redhead as perpetual curate The first Sunday he officiated Haworth Church was filled even to the aisles most of the people wearing the wooden clogs of the district But while Mr Redhead was reading the second lesson the whole congregation as by one impulse began to leave the church making all the noise they could with clattering and clumping of clogs till at length Mr Redhead and the clerk were the only two left to continue the service This was bad enough but the next Sunday the proceedings were far worse Then as before the church was well filled but the aisles were left clear not a creature not an obstacle was in the way The reason for this was made evident about the same time in the reading of the service as the disturbances had begun the previous week A man rode into the church upon an ass with his face turned towards the tail and as many old hats piled on his head as he could possibly carry He began urging his beast round the aisles and the screams and cries and laughter of the congregation entirely drowned all sound of Mr Redhead s voice and I believe he was obliged to desist Hitherto they had not proceeded to anything like personal violence but on the third Sunday they must have been greatly irritated at seeing Mr Redhead determined to brave their will ride up the village street accompanied by several gentlemen from Bradford They put up their horses at the Black Bull the little inn close upon the churchyard for the convenience of arvills as well as for other purposes and went into church On this the people followed with a chimney sweeper whom they had employed to clean the chimneys of some out buildings belonging to the church that very morning and afterward plied with drink till he was in a state of solemn intoxication They placed him right before the reading desk where his blackened face nodded a drunken stupid assent to all that Mr Redhead said At last either prompted by some mischief maker or from some tipsy impulse he clambered up the pulpit stairs and attempted to embrace Mr Redhead Then the profane fun grew fast and furious Some of the more riotous pushed the soot covered chimney sweeper against Mr Redhead as he tried to escape They threw both him and his tormentor down on the ground in the churchyard where the soot bag had been emptied and though at last Mr Redhead escaped into the Black Bull the doors of which were immediately barred the people raged without threatening to stone him and his friends One of my informants is an old man who was the landlord of the inn at the time and he stands to it that such was the temper of the irritated mob that Mr Redhead was in real danger of his life This man however planned an escape for his unpopular inmates The Black Bull is near the top of the long steep Haworth street and at the bottom close by the bridge on the road to Keighley is a turnpike Giving directions to his hunted guests to steal out at the back door through which probably many a ne er do weel has escaped from good Mr Grimshaw s horsewhip the landlord and some of the stable boys rode the horses belonging to the party from Bradford backwards and forwards before his front door among the fiercely expectant crowd Through some opening between the houses those on the horses saw Mr Redhead and his friends creeping along behind the street and then striking spurs they dashed quickly down to the turnpike the obnoxious clergyman and his friends mounted in haste and had sped some distance before the people found out that their prey had escaped and came running to the closed turnpike gate This was Mr Redhead s last appearance at Haworth for many years Long afterwards he came to preach and in his sermon to a large and attentive congregation he good humouredly reminded them of the circumstances which I have described They gave him a hearty welcome for they owed him no grudge although before they had been ready enough to stone him in order to maintain what they considered to be their rights The foregoing account which I heard from two of the survivors in the presence of a friend who can vouch for the accuracy of my repetition has to a certain degree been confirmed by a letter from the Yorkshire gentleman whose words I have already quoted I am not surprised at your difficulty in authenticating matter of fact I find this in recalling what I have heard and the authority on which I have heard anything As to the donkey tale I believe you are right Mr Redhead and Dr Ramsbotham his son in law are no strangers to me Each of them has a niche in my affections I have asked this day two persons who lived in Haworth at the time to which you allude the son and daughter of an acting trustee and each of them between sixty and seventy years of age and they assure me that the donkey was introduced One of them says it was mounted by a half witted man seated with his face towards the tail of the beast and having several hats piled on his head Neither of my informants was however present at these edifying services I believe that no movement was made in the church on either Sunday until the whole of the authorised reading service was gone through and I am sure that nothing was more remote from the more respectable party than any personal antagonism toward Mr Redhead He was one of the most amiable and worthy of men a man to myself endeared by many ties and obligations I never heard before your book that the sweep ascended the pulpit steps He was present however in the clerical habiliments of his order I may also add that among the many who were present at those sad Sunday orgies the majority were non residents and came from those moorland fastnesses on the outskirts of the parish locally designated as ovver th steyres one stage more remote than Haworth from modern civilization To an instance or two more of the rusticity of the inhabitants of the chapelry of Haworth I may introduce you A Haworth carrier called at the office of a friend of mine to deliver a parcel on a cold winter s day and stood with the door open Robin shut the door said the recipient Have you no doors in your country Yoi responded Robin we hev but we nivver steik em I have frequently remarked the number of doors open even in winter When well directed the indomitable and independent energies of the natives of this part of the country are invaluable dangerous when perverted I shall never forget the fierce actions and utterances of one suffering from delirium tremens Whether in its wrath disdain or its dismay the countenance was infernal I called once upon a time on a most respectable yeoman and I was in language earnest and homely pressed to accept the hospitality of the house I consented The word to me was Nah Maister yah mun stop an hev sum te ah yah mun eah yah mun A bountiful table was soon spread at all events time soon went while I scaled the hills to see t maire at wor thretty year owd an t feil at wor fewer On sitting down to the table a venerable woman officiated and after filling the cups she thus addressed me Nah Maister yah mun loawze th taible loose the table The master said Shah meeans yah mun sey t greyce I took the hint and uttered the blessing I spoke with an aged and tried woman at one time who after recording her mercies stated among others her powers of speech by asserting Thank the Lord ah nivver wor a meilly meouthed wumman I feel particularly at fault in attempting the orthography of the dialect but must excuse myself by telling you that I once saw a letter in which the word I have just now used excuse was written ecksqueaize There are some things however which rather tend to soften the idea of the rudeness of Haworth No rural district has been more markedly the abode of musical taste and acquirement and this at a period when it was difficult to find them to the same extent apart from towns in advance of their times I have gone to Haworth and found an orchestra to meet me filled with local performers vocal and instrumental to whom the best works of Handel Haydn Mozart Marcello c c were familiar as household words By knowledge taste and voice they were markedly separate from
