I believe it was about the fifth day and I know at least that James was in one of his fits of gloom when I received three letters The first was from Alan offering to visit me in Leyden the other two were out of Scotland and prompted by the same affair which was the death of my uncle and my own complete accession to my rights Rankeillor s was of course wholly in the business view Miss Grant s was like herself a little more witty than wise full of blame to me for not having written though how was I to write with such intelligence and of rallying talk about Catriona which it cut me to the quick to read in her very presence For it was of course in my own rooms that I found them when I came to dinner so that I was surprised out of my news in the very first moment of reading it This made a welcome diversion for all three of us nor could any have foreseen the ill consequences that ensued It was accident that brought the three letters the same day and that gave them into my hand in the same room with James More and of all the events that [pg ]flowed from that accident and which I might have prevented if I had held my tongue the truth is that they were preordained before Agricola came into Scotland or Abraham set out upon his travels The first that I opened was naturally Alan s and what more natural than that I should comment on his design to visit me but I observed James to sit up with an air of immediate attention Is that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the Appin accident he inquired I told him Ay it was the same and he withheld me some time from my other letters asking of our acquaintance of Alan s manner of life in France of which I knew very little and further of his visit as now proposed All we forfeited folk hang a little together he explained and besides I know the gentleman and though his descent is not the thing and indeed he has no true right to use the name of Stewart he was very much admired in the day of Drummossie He did there like a soldier if some that need not be named had done as well the upshot need not have been so melancholy to remember There were two that did their best that day and it makes a bond between the pair of us says he I could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at him and could almost have wished that Alan had been there to have inquired a little further into that [pg ]mention of his birth Though they tell me the same was indeed not wholly regular Meanwhile I had opened Miss Grant s and could not withhold an exclamation Catriona I cried forgetting the first time since her father was arrived to address her by a handle I am come into my kingdom fairly I am the laird of Shaws indeed my uncle is dead at last She clapped her hands together leaping from her seat The next moment it must have come over both of us at once what little cause of joy was left to either and we stood opposite staring on each other sadly But James showed himself a ready hypocrite My daughter says he is this how my cousin learned you to behave Mr David has lost a near friend and we should first condole with him on his bereavement Troth sir said I turning to him in a kind of anger I can make no such faces His death is as blythe news as ever I got It s a good soldier s philosophy says James Tis the way of flesh we must all go all go And if the gentleman was so far from your favour why very well But we may at least congratulate you on your accession to your estates Nor can I say that either I replied with the same heat It is a good estate what matters that to a lone man that has enough already I had a good revenue before in my frugality and but for the man s [pg ]death which gratifies me shame to me that must confess it I see not how anyone is to be bettered by this change Come come said he you are more affected than you let on or you would never make yourself out so lonely Here are three letters that means three that wish you well and I could name two more here in this very chamber I have known you not so very long but Catriona when we are alone is never done with the singing of your praises She looked up at him a little wild at that and he slid off at once into another matter the extent of my estate which during the most of the dinner time he continued to dwell upon with interest But it was to no purpose he dissembled he had touched the matter with too gross a hand and I knew what to expect Dinner was scarce ate when he plainly discovered his designs He reminded Catriona of an errand and bid her attend to it I do not see you should be gone beyond the hour he added and friend David will be good enough to bear me company till you return She made haste to obey him without words I do not know if she understood I believe not but I was completely satisfied and sat strengthening my mind for what should follow The door had scarce closed behind her departure when the man leaned back in his chair and addressed me with a good affectation of easiness Only the one [pg ]thing betrayed him and that was his face which suddenly shone all over with fine points of sweat I am rather glad to have a word alone with you says he because in our first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended and I have long meant to set you right upon My daughter stands beyond doubt So do you and I would make that good with my sword against all gainsayers But my dear David this world is a censorious place as who should know it better than myself who have lived ever since the days of my late departed father God sain him in a perfect spate of calumnies We have to face to that you and me have to consider of that we have to consider of that And he wagged his head like a minister in a pulpit To what effect Mr Drummond said I I would be obliged to you if you would approach your point Ay ay says he laughing like your character indeed and what I most admire in it But the point my worthy fellow is sometimes in a kittle bit He filled a glass of wine Though between you and me that are such fast friends it need not bother us long The point I need scarcely tell you is my daughter And the first thing is that I have no thought in my mind of blaming you In the unfortunate circumstances what could you do else Deed and I cannot tell [pg ] I thank you for that said I pretty close upon my guard I have besides studied your character he went on your talents are fair you seem to have a moderate competence which does no harm and one thing with another I am very happy to have to announce to you that I have decided on the latter of the two ways open I am afraid I am dull said I What ways are these He bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs Why sir says he I think I need scarce describe them to a gentleman of your condition either that I should cut your throat or that you should marry my daughter You are pleased to be quite plain at last said I And I believe I have been plain from the beginning cries he robustiously I am a careful parent Mr Balfour but I thank God a patient and deleeberate man There is many a father sir that would have hirsled you at once either to the altar or the field My esteem for your character Mr Drummond I interrupted if you have any esteem for me at all I will beg of you to moderate your voice It is quite needless to rowt at a gentleman in the same chamber with yourself and lending you his best attention [pg ] Why very true says he with an immediate change And you must excuse the agitations of a parent I understand you then I continued for I will take no note of your other alternative which perhaps it was a pity you let fall I understand you rather to offer me encouragement in case I should desire to apply for your daughter s hand It is not possible to express my meaning better said he and I see we shall do well together That remains to be yet seen said I But so much I need make no secret of that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender affection and I could not fancy even in a dream a better fortune than to get her I was sure of it I felt certain of you David he cried and reached out his hand to me I put it by You go too fast Mr Drummond said I There are conditions to be made and there is a difficulty in the path which I see not entirely how we shall come over I have told you that upon my side there is no objection to the marriage but I have good reason to believe there will be much on the young lady s This is all beside the mark says he I will engage for her acceptance I think you forget Mr Drummond said I that even in dealing with myself you have been betrayed [pg ]into two three unpalatable expressions I will have none such employed to the young lady I am here to speak and think for the two of us and I give you to understand that I would no more let a wife be forced upon myself than what I would let a husband be forced on the young lady He sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of temper So that this is to be the way of it I concluded I will marry Miss Drummond and that blythely if she is entirely willing But if there be the least unwillingness as I have reason to fear marry her will I never Well well said he this is a small affair As soon as she returns I will sound her a bit and hope to reassure you But I cut in again Not a finger of you Mr Drummond or I cry off and you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else said I It is I that am to be the only dealer and the only judge I shall satisfy myself exactly and none else shall anyways meddle you the least of all Upon my word sir he exclaimed and who are you to be the judge The bridegroom I believe said I This is to quibble he cried You turn your back upon the facts The girl my daughter has no choice left to exercise Her character is gone [pg ] And I ask your pardon said I but while this matter lies between her and you and me that is not so What security have I he cried Am I to let my daughter s reputation depend upon a chance You should have thought of all this long ago said I before you were so misguided as to lose her and not afterwards when it is quite too late I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable for your neglect and I will be browbeat by no man living My mind is quite made up and come what may I will not depart from it a hair s breadth You and me are to sit here in company till her return upon which without either word or look from you she and I are to go forth again to hold our talk If she can satisfy me that she is willing to this step I will then make it and if she cannot I will not He leaped out of his seat like a man stung I can spy your manoeuvre he cried you would work upon her to refuse Maybe ay and maybe no said I That is the way it is to be whatever And if I refuse cries he Then Mr Drummond it will have to come to the throat cutting said I What with the size of the man his great length of arm in which he came near rivalling his father and his reputed skill at weapons I did not use this word without [pg ]some trepidation to say nothing at all of the circumstance that he was Catriona s father But I might have spared myself alarms From the poorness of my lodging he does not seem to have remarked his daughter s dresses which were indeed all equally new to him and from the fact that I had shown myself averse to lend he had embraced a strong idea of my poverty The sudden news of my estate convinced him of his error and he had made but the one bound of it on this fresh venture to which he was now so wedded that I believe he would have suffered anything rather than fall to the alternative of fighting A little while longer he continued to dispute with me until I hit upon a word that silenced him If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself said I I must suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the right about her unwillingness He gabbled some kind of an excuse But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers I added and I think we would do better to preserve a judicious silence The which
