Hilary stretching his slender length wearily in Peter s fat arm chair was saying in his high sweet voice It s the merest pittance Peter yours and mine The Robinsons have it practically all The Robinsons Really you know The sweet voice had a characteristic vibrating break of contempt Hilary had always hated the Robinsons who now had it practically all Hilary looked pale and tired he had been settling his dead uncle s affairs for the last week The Margerisons uncle had not been a lovable man Hilary could not pretend that he had loved him Peter had as far as he had been permitted to do so Peter found it possible to be attached to most of the people he came across he was a person of catholic sympathies and gregarious instincts Even when he heard how the Robinsons had it practically all he bore no resentment either against his uncle or the Robinsons Such was life And of course he and Hilary did not make wise use of money that they had always been told You ll have to leave Cambridge Hilary told him You haven t enough to keep you here I m sorry Peter I m afraid you ll have to begin and try to earn a living But I can t imagine how can you Has any paying line of life ever occurred to you as possible Never Peter assured him But I ve not had time to think it over yet of course I supposed I should be up here for two years more you see At Hilary s You ll have to leave Cambridge his face had changed sharply Here was tragedy indeed Bother the Robinsons But after a moment s pause for recovery he answered Hilary lightly enough Such again was life A marvellous two terms and a half and then the familiar barred gate It was an old story Hilary s thoughts turned to his own situation They never to tell the truth dwelt very long on anybody else s We he said are destitute absolutely It s simply frightful the wear and strain of it Peggy of course he added plaintively is not a good manager She likes spending you know and there s so seldom anything to spend poor Peggy So life is disappointing for her The babies I needn t say are growing up little vagabonds And they will bathe in the canals which isn t respectable of course though one is relieved in a way that they should bathe anywhere If he was selling any pictures Peter reflected he would tell me so he did not enquire Peter had tact as to his questions One rather needed it with Hilary But he wondered vaguely what the babies had at the moment to grow up upon even as little vagabonds Presently Hilary enlightened him I edit a magazine he said and Peter perceived that he was both proud and ashamed of the fact At least I am going to A monthly publication for the entertainment and edification of the Englishman in Venice Lord Evelyn Urquhart is financing it You know he has taken up his residence in Venice A pleasant crank Venice is his latest craze He buys glass And indeed most other things He shops all day It s a mania When he was young I believe he had a very fine taste It s dulled now a fearful life as they say Well his last fancy is to run a magazine and I m to edit it It s to be called The Gem Gemm Adriatica you know and all that besides it s more or less appropriate to the contents It s to be largely concerned with what Lord Evelyn calls charming things Things the visiting Englishman likes to hear about you know It aims at being the Complete Tourist s Guide I have to get hold of people who ll write articles on the Duomo mosaics and the galleries and churches and palaces and so on and glass and lace and anything else that occurs to them in a way calculated to appeal to the cultivated British resident or visitor I detest the breed I needn t say Pampered hotel Philistines pretending to culture and profaning the sanctuaries Ruskin in hand Ruskin Really you know Well anyhow my mission in life for the present is to minister to their insatiable appetite for rhapsodising over what they feel it incumbent on them to admire Rather fascinating Peter said It was a pity that Hilary always so disliked any work he had to do Work a terrific insatiable god demanding its hideous human sacrifices from the dawn of the world till twilight so Hilary saw it The idea of being horrible all the concrete details into which it was translated were horrible too If it was me said Peter I should minister to my own appetite no one else s Bother the cultivated resident He d jolly well have to take what I gave him And glass and mosaic and lace what glorious things to write about I rather love Lord Evelyn don t you Peter remembered him at Astleys in Berkshire Urquhart s uncle tall and slim and exquisite with beautiful waistcoats and white attractive nervous hands that played with a monocle and a high pitched voice and a whimsical prematurely worn out face and a habit of screwing up short sighted eyes and saying with his queer closed enunciation Quate charming Quate He had always liked Peter who had been a gentle and amused boy and had reminded him of Sylvia Hope lacking her beauty but with a funny touch of her charm Peter had loved the things he loved too the precious and admirable things he had collected round him through a recklessly extravagant life Peter at fifteen in the first hour of his first visit to Astleys had been caught out of the incredible romance of being in Urquhart s home into a new marvel and stood breathless before a Bow rose bowl of soft and mellow paste ornamented with old Japan May flowers in red and gold and green and dated New Canton Lake it a high voice had asked behind his shoulder Lake the sort of thing and there was the tall funny man swaying on his heels and screwing his glass into his eye and looking down on Peter with whimsical interest Little Peter had said shyly that he did Prefer chaney to cricket asked Urquhart s uncle with his agreeable laugh that was too attractive to be described as a titter a name that its high light quality might have suggested But to that Peter said No He had been asked to Astleys for the cricket week he was going to play for Urquhart s team Not that he was any good but to scrape through without disgrace of course he didn t was at the moment the goal of life Lord Evelyn had seemed disappointed If I could get you away from Denis he said I ll be bound cricket wouldn t be in the also rans And at that moment Denis had sauntered up and Peter s worshipping regard had turned from Lord Evelyn s rose bowl to his nephew and it was Bow china that was not among the also rans At that too Lord Evelyn had laughed with his queer closed mirth Keep that till you fall in love he had inwardly admonished Peter s back as the two walked away together I daresay she won t deserve it any better but that s a law of nature and this is sheer squandering My word how that boy does lake things and people After all it was hardly for any Urquhart to condemn squandering That was Lord Evelyn as he lived in Peter s memory a generous whimsical pleasant crank touched with his nephew s glamour of charm When Peter said I rather love him don t you Hilary replied He s a fearful old spendthrift Peter demurred at the old It jarred with one s conceptions of Lord Evelyn I don t suppose he s much over fifty he surmised No I daresay Hilary indifferently admitted He s gone the pace of course Drugs and all that He soon won t have a sound faculty left Oh I m attached to him he s entertaining and one can really talk to him which is exceptional in Venice or indeed anywhere else Is his nephew still up here by the way Yes He s going down this term You see a good deal of him I suppose Off and on said Peter Of course said Hilary you re almost half brothers I do feel that the Urquharts owe us something for the sake of the connexion I shall talk to Lord Evelyn about you He was very fond of your mother I am very sorry about you Peter We must think it over sometime seriously He got up and began to walk about the room in his nervous restless way looking at Peter s things Peter s room was rather pleasing Everything in it had the air of being the selection of a personal and discriminating affection There was a serene self confidence about Peter s tastes he always knew precisely what he liked irrespective of what anyone else liked If he had happened to admire The Soul s Awakening he would beyond doubt have hung a copy of it in his room What he had as a matter of fact hung in his room very successfully expressed an aspect of himself The room conveyed restfulness and an immense love innate rather than grafted of the pleasures of the eye The characteristic of restfulness was conveyed partly by the fat green sofa and the almost superfluous number of extremely comfortable arm chairs and Peter s attitude in one of them On a frame in a corner a large piece of embroidery was stretched a cherry tree in blossom coming to slow birth on a green serge background Peter was quite good at embroidery He carried pieces of it mostly elaborately designed book covers about in his pockets and took them out at tea parties and surreptitiously at lectures He said it was soothing like smoking only smoking didn t soothe him it made him feel ill On days when he had been doing tiresome or boring or jarring things or been associating with a certain type of person he did a great deal of embroidery in the evenings because as he said it was such a change The embroidery stood for a symbol a type of the pleasures of the senses and when he fell to it with fervour beyond the ordinary one understood that he had been having a surfeit of the displeasures of the senses and felt need to restore the balance Hilary stopped before a piece of extremely shabby frayed and dingy tapestry that had the appearance of having once been even dingier and shabbier It looked as if it had lain for years in a dusty corner of a dusty old shop till someone had found it and been pleased by it and taken possession loving it through its squalor Rather nice said Hilary Really good isn t it Peter nodded Gobelin of the best time Someone told me that afterwards When I bought it I only knew it was nice A man wanted to buy it from me for quite a lot Hilary looked about him You ve got some good things How do you pick them up I try said Peter to look as if I didn t care whether I had them or not Then they let me have them for very little The man I got that tapestry from didn t know how nice it was I did but I cheated him Well Hilary said passing his hand wearily over his forehead I must go to your detestable station and catch my train I ve got a horrible headache The strain of all this is frightful He looked as if it was His pale face nervous and strained stabbed at Peter s affection for him Peter s affection for Hilary had always been and always would be an unreasoning loyal unspoilably tender thing He went to the station to help Hilary to catch his train The enterprise was a failure it was not a job at which either Margerison was good They had to wait in the detestable station for another The annoyance of that it is really an abnormally depressing station worked on Hilary s nervous system to such an extent that he might have flung himself on the line and so found peace from the disappointments of life had not Peter been at hand to cheer him up There were certainly points about young Peter as a companion for the desperate Peter having missed hall as well as Hilary s train went back to his room and put an egg on to boil He lay back in his most comfortable chair to watch it he needed comfort rather He was going down It had been so jolly and it was over He had not got much to show for the good time he had had Physically he was more of a wreck than he had been when he came up He was slightly lame in one leg having broken it at football before he had been forbidden to play and had it badly set He mended so badly always He was also at the moment right handed habitually he used his left and that was motor bicycling He had not particularly distinguished himself in his work He was good at nothing except diabolo and not very good at that And he had spent more money than he possessed having drawn lavishly on his next year s allowance He might in fact have been described as an impoverished and discredited wreck But for such a one he had looked very cheerful till Hilary had said that about going down That was really depressing Peter as the egg boiled looked back rather wistfully over his year It seemed a very long time ago since he had come up His had been an undistinguished arrival he had not come as a sandwich man between two signboards that labelled his past career and explained his path that was to be he had been unaddressed to any destination The only remark on his vague and undistinguished label had perhaps been of the nature of Brittle This side up with care He had no fame at any game he did not row he was neither a sporting nor in any marked degree a reading man He did a little work but he was not very fond of it or very good The only things one could say of him were that he seemed to have an immense faculty of enjoyment and a considerable number of friends who knew him as Margery and ate muffins and chocolates between tea and dinner in his rooms He had been asked at the outset by one of these friends what sort of things he meant to go in for He had said that he didn t exactly know Must one go in for anything except exams The friend who was vigorously inclined had said that one certainly ought One could he had measured Peter s frail physique and remembered all the things he couldn t do play golf Peter had thought that one really couldn t it was such a chilly game Well of course one might speak at the union said the persevering friend insisting it seemed on finding Peter a career Don t they talk about politics enquired Peter I couldn t do that you know I don t approve of politics If ever I have a vote I shall sell it to the highest female bidder Fancy being a Liberal or a Conservative out of all the nice things there are in the world to be There are health fooders now I d rather be that And teetotallers A man told me he was a teetotaller to day I ll go in for that if you like because I don t much like wine And I hate beer These are rather nice chocolates I mean they were The indefatigable friend had further informed him that one might be a Fabian and have a red tie and encourage the other Fabians to wash Or one might ride One might Peter had made a suggestion of his own ride a motor bicycle I saw a man on one to day I mean he had been on it it was on him at the moment it had chucked him off and was dancing on him and something that smelt was coming out of a hole He was such a long way from home I was sorry about it His friend had said Serve him right Brute expressing the general feeling of the moment about men who rode motor bicycles Isn t it funny Peter had reflectively said They must get such an awful headache first and then to be chucked off and jumped on so hard and covered with the smelly stuff and then to have to walk home dragging it when it s deformed and won t run on its wheels Unless of course one is blown up into little bits and is at rest But it is so awfully frightfully ugly to look at and to smell and to hear Like your wallpaper you know Peter s eyes had rested contentedly on his own peaceful green walls He really hadn t felt in the least like going in for anything either motor bicycling or examinations I suppose you ll just footle then his friend had summed it up and left him because it was half past six and they had dinner at that strange hour That was why they were able to run it into their tea since obviously nothing could be done between even by Peter s energetic friend This friend had little hope for Peter Of course he would just footle he always had But one was nevertheless rather fond of him One would like him to do things and have a sporting time As a matter of fact Peter gave his friend an agreeable surprise He went in or attempted to go in for a good many things He plunged ardently into football though he had never been good and though he always got extremely tired over it which was supposed to be bad for him and frequently got smashed up which he knew to be unpleasant for him This came to an abrupt end half way through the term Then he took quite suddenly to motor bicycling All this is merely to say that the incalculable factor that sets temperament and natural predilection at nought had entered into Peter s life Of course it was absurd Urquhart being what he was could successfully do a number of things that Peter being what he was must inevitably come to grief over But still he indomitably tried He even profaned the roads and outraged all sthetic fitness in the endeavour clacking into the country upon a hired motor bicycle and making his head ache badly and getting very cold and being from time to time thrown off and jumped upon and going about in bandages telling enquirers that he supposed he must have knocked against something somewhere he didn t remember exactly The energetic friend had been caustic I ve no intention of sympathising with you he had remarked because you deserve all you get You ass you know when it s possible to get smashed up over anything you re safe to do it so what on earth do you expect when you take up a thing like this Instant death every minute Peter had truly replied His nerves had been a little shaken by his last ride which had set his trouser leg on fire suddenly and nearly as he remarked burnt him to death But I go on I expect the worst but I am resigned The hero is not he who feels no fear for that were brutal and irrational What do you do it for his friend had querulously and superfluously demanded It s so frightfully funny Peter had said reflecting that I should be doing it That s why I suppose It makes me laugh You might take to the fiddle if you wanted a good laugh I take to my motor bicycle It s the only way to cheer oneself up when life is disappointing to go and do something entirely ridiculous I used to stand on my head when I d been rowed or sat upon or when there was a beastly wind it cheered me a lot I ve given that up now so I motor bicycle Besides he had added you said I must go in for something You wouldn t like it if I did my embroidery all day But on the days when he had been motor bicycling Peter had to do a great deal of embroidery in the evenings for the sake of the change I don t wonder you need it a friend of the more sthetically cultured type remarked one evening finding him doing it You ve been playing round with the Urquhart Fitzmaurice lot to day haven t you Nice man Fitzmaurice isn t he I like his tie pins You know we almost lost him last summer He hung in the balance and our hearts were in our mouths But he is still with us You look as if he had been very much with you Margery Peter looked meditative and stitched Old Fitz he murmured is one of the best A real sportsman Don t Elmslie I didn t think of that I heard Childers say it Childers also said By Jove old Fitz knocks spots out of em every time but I don t know what he meant I m trying to learn to talk like Childers When I can do that I shall buy a tie pin like Fitzmaurice s only mine will be paste Streater s is paste he s another nice man He certainly is In fact Margery you really are not particular enough about the company you keep You shun neither the over bred nor the under bred Personally I affect neither because they don t amuse me You embrace both Yes Peter mildly agreed But I don t embrace Streater you know I draw the line at Streater Everyone draws the line at Streater he s of the baser sort like his tie pins Wouldn t it be vexing to have people always drawing lines at you There d be nothing you could well do except to draw one at them and they wouldn t notice yours probably if they d got theirs in first You could only sneer One can always sneer I sneered to day You can t sneer Elmslie told him brutally and you can t draw lines and what on earth you hang about with so many different sorts of idiots for I don t know I think if circumstances absolutely compelled me to make bosom friends of either I should choose the under bred poor rather than the over bred rich That s the sort of man I ve no use for The sort of man with so much money that he has to chuck it all about the place to get rid of it The sort of man who talks to you about beagles The sort of man who has a different fancy waistcoat for each day of the week Well said Peter that s nice I wish I had His friend turned a grave regard on him The sort of man who rides a motor bicycle You really should Margery he went on learn to be more fastidious You mustn t let yourself be either dazzled by fancy waistcoats or sympathetically moved by unclean collars Neither is interesting I never said they were Peter said It s the people inside them Peter in brief was a lover of his kind and the music life played to him was of a varied and complex nature But looking back it was easy to see how there had been running through all the variations a dominant motive in the piece As Peter listened to the boiling of his egg and thought how hard it would be when he took it off the dominant motive came in and stood by the fire and looked down on Peter He jingled things in his pockets and swayed to and fro on his heels like his uncle Evelyn and he was slim in build and fair and pale and clear cut of face and gentle and rather indifferent in manner and soft and casual in voice and he was in his fourth year and life went extremely well with him It boils he told Peter of the egg Peter took it off and fished it out with a spoon and began rummaging for an egg cup and salt and marmalade and buns in the locker beneath his window seat Having found these things he composed himself in the fat arm chair to dine with a sigh of satisfaction You slacker Urquhart observed Well can you come to morrow The drag starts at eleven It s quite hard said Peter unreasonably disappointed in it Oh yes rather I ll come How short the time for doing things had suddenly become Urquhart remarked looking at the carpet What a revolting mess Why My self filling bath Peter explained I invented it myself Well it did fill itself Quite suddenly and all at once you know It was a very beautiful sight But rather unrestrained at present I must improve it Oh this is my last term Sent down Urquhart sympathetically enquired It was what one might expect to happen to Peter Destitute Peter told him The Robinsons have it practically all Hilary told me to day I am thrown on the world I shall have to work Hilary is destitute too and Peggy has nothing to spend and the babies insist on bathing in the canals Bad luck for us isn t it Oh and Hilary is going to edit a magazine called The Gem for your uncle in Venice That seems rather a nice plan The question is what am I to apply my great gifts to Urquhart whistled softly As bad as all that is it Quite as bad Worse if anything The only thing in careers that I can fancy at the moment is art dealing picking up nice things cheap and selling them dear you know Only I should always want to keep them of course If I don t do that I shall have to live by my needle If they pass the Sweated Industries Bill I suppose one will get quite a lot It s the only Bill I ve ever been interested in My uncle was extremely struck by the intelligent way I took notice of it when I had disappointed him so much about Tariff Reform and Education You d probably be among the unskilled millions whom the bill turns out of work Then I shall be unemployed and march with a flag I shall rather like that Oh I suppose somehow one manages to live doesn t one whether one has a degree or not And personally I d rather not have one because it would be such a mortifying one Besides Peter added after a luminous moment of reflection I don t believe a degree really matters much in my profession You didn t know I had a profession I expect I ve just thought of it I m going to be a buyer for the Ignorant Rich Make their houses liveable in They tell me what they want I get hold of it for them Turn them out an Italian drawing room Della Robbia mantel piece Florentine fire irons Renaissance ceiling tapestries and so on Things they haven t energy to find for themselves or intelligence to know when they see them I love finding them and I m practised at cheating One has to cheat if one s poor but eager A poor trade but my own I can grub about low shops all day and go to sales at Christie s What fun Urquhart said You d better begin on Leslie You re exactly what he wants Who s Leslie Peter was eating buns and marmalade in restored spirits Leslie s an Ignorant Rich He s a Hebrew His parents weren t called Leslie but never mind Leslie rolls He also bounds but not aggressively high One can quite stand him in fact he has his good points He s rich but eager Also he doesn t know a good thing when he sees it He lacks your discerning eye Margery But such is his eagerness that he is determined to have good things even though he doesn t know them when he sees them He would like to be a connoisseur a collector of world wide fame He would like to fill his house with things that would make people open their eyes and whistle But at present he s got no guide but price and his own pure taste Consequently he gets hopelessly let in and people whistle but not in the way he wants He s quite frank he told me all about it What he wants is a man with a good eye to do his shopping for him It would be an ideal berth for a man with the desire but not the power to purchase a unique partnership of talent with capital There you are You supply the talent He d take you on for certain It would be a very nice little job for you to begin with By the time you ve decorated his town house and his country seat and his shooting box and all his other residences you ll be fairly started in your profession I ll write to him about you Peter chuckled How frightfully funny though I wonder why anyone should want to have things unless they like to have them for themselves Just as if I were to hire Streater say to buy really beautiful photographs of actresses for me Well suppose he didn t like the things I bought for him Suppose our tastes didn t agree Should I have to try and suit his or would he have to put up with mine There s only one taste in the matter Urquhart told him He hasn t got any You could buy him any old thing and tell him it was good and he d believe you provided it cost enough That s why he has to have a buyer honest though poor he couldn t check him in the least I shall tell him that however many the things you might lie about you are a George Washington where your precious bric a brac is concerned because it s the one thing you care about too much to take it flippantly Peter chuckled again Life having for a little while drifted perilously near to the shores of dullness again bobbed merrily on the waters of farce What a lot of funny things there were all waiting to be done This that Urquhart suggested should certainly if possible be one of them A week later when Mr Leslie had written to engage Peter s services Urquhart s second cousin Rodney came into Peter s room a thing he had never done before because he did not know Peter much and said But why not start a curiosity shop of your own Or be a travelling pedlar It would be so much more amusing Peter felt a little flattered He liked Rodney who was in his third year and had never before taken any particular notice of him Rodney was a rather brilliant science man he was also an apostle a vegetarian a fine football player an ex Fabian and a few other things He was a large emaciated looking person with extraordinarily bright grey eyes inspiring a lean pale dark browed face the face of an ascetic lit by a flame of energising life He looked as if he would spend and be spent by it to the last charred fragment in pursuit of the idea There was nothing in his vivid aspect of Peter Margerison s gentle philosophy of acquiescence he looked as if he would to the end dictate terms to life rather than accept them an attitude combined oddly with a view which regarded the changes and chances of circumstance as more or less irrelevant to life s vital essence Peter didn t know why Rodney wanted him to be a travelling pedlar except that as he had anyhow once been a Socialist he presumably disliked the rich ignorant or otherwise and included Leslie among them Peter always had a vague feeling that Rodney did not wholly appreciate his cousin Urquhart for this same reason A man of means Rodney would no doubt have held has much ado to save his soul alive better if possible be a bricklayer or a mendicant friar Some day said Peter politely I may have to be a travelling pedlar This is only an experiment to see if it works He was conscious suddenly of two opposing principles that crossed swords with a clash Rodney and Urquhart poverty and wealth he could not analyse further But Rodney was newly friendly to him for the rest of that term Urquhart commented on it Stephen always takes notice of the destitute The best qualification for his regard is to commit such a solecism that society cuts you or such a crime that you get a month s hard Short of that it will do to have a hole in your coat or paint a bad picture or produce a yesterday s handkerchief He probably thinks you re on the road to that When you get there he ll swear eternal friendship He can t away with
