Rosa Varona did not die On the contrary under her lover s care she made so amazingly swift a recovery that improvement was visible from hour to hour she rallied like a wilted flower under a refreshing rain It was O Reilly s presence as much as the nourishing diet provided by his money which effected this marvel although the certainty that Esteban was alive and safe put added force into her determination to live Rosa found hope springing up in her breast and one day she caught herself laughing The marvel of it was unbelievable O Reilly was sitting beside her bed of leaves at the time impulsively she pressed his hand to her lips repeating a question she had asked him many times Do you love me For answer he bent and kissed her What he said was of no consequence Rosa held his hand against her cheek at a loss for words with which to voice her gladness Such happiness as mine belongs in heaven she managed to tell him Sometimes it frightens me With you by my side this prison is a paradise and I want for nothing War suffering distress I can t imagine they longer exist Nevertheless they do and Matanzas is anything but a paradise said he It is hell and we must set about quickly to get out of it Escape do you mean But that is impossible Asensio can tell you all about that The Spaniards used to issue passes for the men to go outside the lines in search of food It was just a trick They never came back all of them were killed Every one knows better than to try now Nevertheless we can t stay here much longer In answer to the girl s puzzled inquiry he explained My money is gone all but a few cents This is the last of our food and there is no chance of getting more Jacket has some mysterious source of supply and he manages to bring in something every now and then but there are five of us to feed and he can t furnish more than enough for himself No we must make a move at once while we have the strength Rosa had not asked the source whence came the blessed food which was bringing the life blood back into her body and although that food was not much a little meal a plantain an occasional scrap of meat or fish it had never occurred to her that the supply might be limited She met the problem bravely however I have been close to death so long that it means little to me she confessed I have you and well with you at my side I can face the worst Oh we won t give up until we have to he assured her If I had money it would be a simple proposition to bribe some guard to pass us through the lines but I have spent all that General Betancourt gave me He smoothed back Rosa s dark hair and smiled reassuringly at her Well I ll manage somehow so don t worry your pretty head I ll find the price if I have to waylay old Don Mario and rob him Don t you think I look like a bandit The very sight of me would terrify that fat rascal To me you are beautiful breathed the girl Then she lowered her eyes La la How I spoil you I have quite forgotten how to be ladylike Isabel was right when she called me a bold and forward hussy Now then please turn your face aside for I wish to think and so long as you look at me I cannot I make love to you brazenly See Now then that is much better I shall hold your hand so When I kiss it you may look at me again for a moment Drawing herself closer to O Reilly Rosa began thoughtfully Before you came I more than once was on the point of appealing to some of my former friends but they are all Spaniards and we are no longer simpatico you understand Rosa paused for his answer Perfectly I m in the same fix Of all the people I used to know there isn t one but would denounce me if I made myself known Now that I ve been fighting with the Insurrectos I daren t even go to the American consul for help if there is an American consul Rosa nodded then continued hesitatingly I had a vivid dream last night Perhaps it was a portent Who knows It was about that stepmother of mine You remember how she met her death I wrote you Yes and Esteban also told me It was he who recovered her body from the well One day while we were in hiding away up yonder in the Yumuri he showed me an old coin I know O Reilly said quickly He told me the whole story He thinks that doubloon is a clue to your father s fortune but I can t put much faith in it In fact I didn t believe until this moment that there was a doubloon at all Oh indeed there was I saw it Then it wasn t merely a sick fancy of your brother s Indeed no it Rosa broke off to exclaim O Reilly you are looking at me But you gave me the signal to look he protested Nothing of the sort you placed your fingers upon my lips There was a moment of silence during which the lovers were oblivious to all but each other then Rosa murmured How strange Sometimes your eyes are blue and sometimes gray Does that mean that your love too can change Certainly not But come what about Esteban and that doubloon With an effort the girl brought herself back to earth Well it occurred to me in the light of that dream last night that Esteban may have been right Of course nobody outside of our family credits the old story and yet my father was considered a very rich man at one time Pancho Cueto believed in the existence of the treasure and he was in a position to know True Perhaps after all O Reilly frowned meditatively Rosa lifted herself upon her elbow her eyes sparkling Wouldn t it be wonderful if it were true Just think O Reilly cases of Spanish gold silver coins in casks packages of gems Oh I ve heard Isabel talk about it often enough Don t forget those pearls from the Caribbean as large as plums Johnny smiled I could never quite swallow that A pearl the size of a currant would buy our freedom right now After a moment he went on more seriously I ve a notion to look into that old well this very afternoon I I dare say I m foolish but somehow the story doesn t sound so improbable as it did Perhaps it is worth investigating He made up his mind swiftly I I m off this very instant When O Reilly emerged from the hut he found Jacket industriously at work over a fragment of grindstone which he had somewhere unearthed The boy looked up at his friend s approach and held out for inspection a long thin file which he was slowly shaping into a knife blade What do you think of that he queried proudly It may come in handy when we are ready to clear out of this pesthole Where did you get it Oh I stole it I steal everything I can lay my hands on nowadays One can never tell when he may have a throat to cut and a file has good steel in it Since you are such an accomplished thief do you think you could steal something for me O Reilly inquired A piece of rope Rope Jacket was puzzled Rope is only good for hanging Spaniards My friend in the fish market has a volandra and perhaps I can rob him of a halyard Laying aside his task Jacket arose and made off in the direction of the water front He was back within an hour and under his shirt he carried a coil of worn but serviceable rope Without waiting to explain his need for this unusual article O Reilly linked arms with the boy and set out to climb La Cumbre When at last they stood in the unused quarry and Johnnie made known his intention to explore the old well Jacket regarded him with undisguised amazement What do you expect to find down there the latter inquired To tell you the truth I don t really expect to find anything the man confessed Now that I m here I m beginning to feel silly nevertheless I m going to have a look for the hidden treasure of the Varonas Hidden treasure From Jacket s expression it was plain that he feared his friend was mildly mad Even after O Reilly had told him something about old Don Esteban s missing riches he scouted the story He peeped inquisitively into the dark opening of the well then he shook his head Caramba What an idea Was this old man crazy to throw his money away He he had more than he knew what to do with and he wished to save it from the Spaniards O Reilly explained lamely Humph Nobody ever had more money than he wanted The boy s disgust at such credulity was plain This well looks just like any other only deeper you d better look out that you don t break your neck like that foolish old woman that Dona What s Her Name O Reilly did indeed feel that he was making himself ridiculous nevertheless he made the rope fast and swung himself down out of the sunlight leaving Jacket to stand guard over him Perhaps fifteen minutes later he reappeared panting from his exertions He was wet slimy his clothes were streaked and stained with mud Jacket began to laugh shrilly at his appearance Ha What a big lizard is this Your beautiful garments are spoiled And the treasure Where is it The lad was delighted He bent double with mirth he slapped his bare legs and stamped his feet in glee O Reilly grinned good naturedly and replaced the planks which had covered the orifice then hid the rope in some near by bushes On their way back he endured his young friend s banter absent mindedly but as they neared Asensio s house he startled Jacket by saying Can you manage to find a pick ax or a crowbar Jacket s eyes opened he stopped in the middle of the dusty road What did you see down there compadre Tell me Nothing much Just enough to make me want to see more Do you think you can steal some sort of a tool for me I can try Please do And remember say nothing before Asensio or his wife Rosa met O Reilly just inside the door and at sight of her he uttered an exclamation of surprise for during his absence she had removed the stain from her face and discarded that disfigurement which Evangelina had fitted to her back prior to their departure from the Pan de Matanzas She stood before him now straight and slim and graceful the Rosa of his dreams only very thin very fragile Her poor tatters only enhanced her prettiness so he thought Rosa dear Do you think this is quite safe he ventured doubtfully Evangelina who was bending over her husband straightened herself and came forward with a smile upon her black face She is beautiful eh Too beautiful to look at What did I tell you Rosa was in delightful confusion at O Reilly s evident surprise and admiration Then I m not so altogether changed she asked Why you haven t changed at all except to grow more beautiful Evangelina is right you are too beautiful to look at But wait He drew her aside and whispered I ve been down in the well Some tremor in his voice some glint in his eyes caused the girl to seize him eagerly fiercely I may be wrong he said hurriedly there may be nothing in it and yet I saw something What Wooden beams timbers of some sort behind the stone curbing It was plain Rosa did not comprehend so he hurried on At first I noticed nothing unusual except that the bottom of the well is nearly dry filled up you know with debris and stuff that has fallen in from the curbing above then I saw that although the well is dug through rock nevertheless it is entirely curbed up with stones laid in mortar That struck me as queer Yes I noticed too in one place that there was wood behind as if timbers had been placed there to cover the entrance to a cave You know this Cuban rock is full of caverns Rosa clasped her hands she began to tremble You have found it O Reilly You HAVE she whispered No no I ve found nothing yet But I ve sent Jacket for a pick or a bar and to night I m going to pull down those stones and see what is behind them To night You must let me go too I want to help Very well But meanwhile you mustn t let your hopes rise too high for there is every chance that you will be disappointed And don t mention it to Evangelina Now then I ve a few pennies left and I m going to buy some candles Rosa embraced her lover impulsively Something tells me it is true Something tells me you are going to save us all Evangelina in the far corner of the hut muttered to her husband Such love birds They are like parrakeets forever kissing and cooing Jacket returned at dusk and with him he brought a rusty three foot iron bar evidently part of a window grating The boy was tired disgusted and in a vile temper A pick ax A crowbar He cursed eloquently One might as well try to steal a cannon out of San Severino I m ready to do anything within reason but Why this will do nicely it is just what I want O Reilly told him Humph I m glad to hear it for that rod was nearly the death of me I broke my back wrenching at it and the villain who owned the house may a bad lightning split him he ran after me until I nearly expired If my new knife had been sharp I would have turned and sent him home with it between his ribs To morrow I shall put an edge on it Believe me I ran until my lungs burst Little food remained in the hut barely enough for Asensio and the women and inasmuch as O Reilly had spent his last centavo for candles he and Jacket were forced to go hungry again Late that evening after the wretched prison quarters had grown quiet the three treasure hunters stole out of their hovel and wound up the hill In spite of their excitement they went slowly for none of them had the strength to hurry Fortunately there were few prowlers within the lines hunger having robbed the reconcentrados of the spirit to venture forth and in consequence Spanish vigilance had relaxed it was now confined to the far flung girdle of intrenchments which encircled the city The trio encountered no one Leaving Jacket on guard at the crest of the hill O Reilly stationed Rosa at the mouth of the well then lowered himself once more into it Lighting his candle he made a careful examination of the place with the result that Esteban s theory of the missing riches seemed even less improbable than it had earlier in the day The masonry work he discovered had been done with a painstaking thoroughness which spoke of the abundance of slave labor and time had barely begun to affect it Here and there a piece of the mortar had loosened and come away but for the most part it stood as solid as the stones between which it was laid Shoulder high to O Reilly there appeared to be a section of the curbing less smoothly fitted than the rest and through an interstice in this he detected what seemed to be a damp wooden beam At this point he brought his iron bar into play It was not long before he discovered that his work was cut out for him The cement was like flint and his blunt makeshift implement was almost useless against it Ankle deep in the muddy water he patiently pecked and pounded and chipped endeavoring to enlarge the crevice so as to use his bar as a lever The sweat streamed from him and he became dismayed at his own weakness He was forced to rest frequently Rosa hung over the orifice above encouraging him inquiring eagerly as to his progress During his frequent breathing spells he could discern her white face dimly illumined by the candle light from below After he had worked for an hour or two he made a report It begins to look as if there really was a bulkhead or a door in there The girl clapped her hands and laughed with delight Do hurry dear I m dying of suspense O Reilly groaned That fellow Sebastian knew his business This cement is like steel and I m afraid of breaking my crowbar Rosa found a leaf folded a kiss into it and dropped it to him That will give you strength she declared O Reilly lost all count of time after a while and he was incredulous when Jacket came to warn him that daylight was less than an hour away Why I haven t started he protested He discovered much to his surprise that he was ready to drop from fatigue and that his hands were torn and blistered when he had climbed the rope to the upper air he fell exhausted in the deep grass I I m not myself at all he apologized nothing to eat you know But the work will go faster now for I ve made a beginning Do you still think Rosa hesitated to voice the question which trembled on her lips I ll know for sure to night He directed Jacket to replace the planks over the well then the three of them stole away O Reilly spent most of that day in a profound stupor of exhaustion while Rosa watched anxiously over him Jacket it seemed had peacefully slumbered on picket duty so he occupied himself by grinding away at his knife The last scraps of food disappeared that evening When night fell and it came time to return to the top of La Cumbre O Reilly asked himself if his strength would prove sufficient for the task in hand He was spiritless sore weak he ached in every bone and muscle and it required all his determination to propel himself up the hill He wondered if he were wise thus to sacrifice his waning energies on a hope so forlorn as this but by now he had begun to more than half believe in the existence of the Varona treasure and he felt an almost irresistible curiosity to learn what secret if any was concealed behind those water soaked timbers at the bottom of the well He realized of course that every hour he remained here now that food and money were gone lessened the chances of escape but on the other hand he reasoned with equal force that if he had indeed stumbled upon the missing hoard salvation for all of them was assured The stake it seemed to him was worth the hazard Given tempered tools to work with it would have been no great undertaking to tear down that cemented wall of stones but armed with nothing except his bare hands and that soft iron bar O Reilly spent nearly the whole night at his task Long before the last rock had yielded however he beheld that which caused him to turn a strained face upward to Rosa There s a little door as sure as you live he told her The girl was beside herself with excitement Yes What else What more do you see Nothing It appears to be made of solid timbers and has two huge hand wrought locks Locks Then we HAVE found it Rosa closed her eyes she swayed momentarily Esteban was right Locks indeed That means something to hide Oh if I could only help you God If I only had something ANYTHING to work with muttered the American as he fell to with redoubled energy He no longer tried to conserve his strength for the treasure seeker s lust beset him Rosa looked on wringing her hands and urging him to greater haste But the low thick door was built of some hard native wood it was wet and tough and slippery O Reilly s blows made no impression upon it nor upon the heavy hasps and staples with which it was secured in place The latter were deeply rusted to be sure but they withstood his efforts and he was finally forced to rest baffled enraged half hysterical from weakness and fatigue Daylight was at hand once more but he refused to give up and worked on stubbornly furiously until Rosa in an agony besought him to desist Johnnie again collapsed on the grass and lay panting while the other two replaced the planks Another hour and I d have been into it he declared huskily You will skill yourself Jacket told him Rosa bent over him with shining eyes and parted lips Yes said she Be patient We will come back O Reilly and to night we shall be rich Colonel Cobo lit a black cigarette leaned back in his chair and exhaled two fierce jets of smoke through his nostrils For a full moment he scowled forbiddingly at the sergeant who had asked to see him What s this you are telling me he inquired finally The sergeant a mean faced low browed man stirred uneasily It is God s truth There are spirits on La Cumbre and I wish to see the priest about it Spirits What kind of spirits The fellow shrugged Evil spirits spirits from hell The men are buying charms Bah I took you to be a sensible person You don t believe me Well I didn t believe them when they told me about it But I saw with my own eyes Cobo leaned forward mildly astonished Of all his villainous troop this man was the last one he had credited with imagination of this sort What did you see A ghost my Colonel nothing else La Cumbre is no place for an honest Christian The colonel burst into a mocking laugh An honest Christian YOU Of all my vile ruffians you are the vilest Why you re a thief a liar and an assassin You are lying to me now Come the truth for once before I give you the componte As God is my judge I m telling you the truth protested the soldier Flog me if you will rather the componte than another night in those trenches You know that old quinta Where Pancho Cueto made a goat of himself Perfectly Do you mean to say that you saw old Esteban Varona walking with his head in his hands No but I saw that she devil who fell in the well and broke her neck Eh When did you behold this this marvel Two nights ago She was there beside the well and her face shone through the night like a lantern Christ There was fire upon it She came and went like a moth in the lamplight I tell you I repented of my sins Some of the men laughed at me when I told them as they had laughed at the others But last night two of the doubters went up there Exactly And they saw nothing Your pardon my Colonel They came back in a cold sweat and they spent the night on their knees The woman was there again You have seen the salt sea at night Well her face was aglow like that so they said They heard the clanking of chains too and the sound of hammers coming from the very bowels of the earth It is all plain enough when you know the story But it is terrifying This is indeed amazing Cobo acknowledged but of course there is some simple explanation Spirits if indeed there are such things are made of nothing they are like thin air How then could they rattle chains You probably saw some wretched pacificos in search of food and imagined the rest Indeed Then what did I hear with these very ears Whispers murmurs groans and the clinkety clink of old Sebastian s chisel For his sins that old slave is chained in some cavern of the mountain Soundless I m no baby I know when I m asleep and I know when I m awake That place is accursed and I want no more of it Cobo fell into frowning meditation allowing his cigarette to smolder down until it burned his thick fingers He was not a superstitious man and he put no faith in the supernatural nevertheless he was convinced that his sergeant was not lying and reference to Pancho Cueto had set his mind to working along strange channels He had known Cueto well and the latter s stubborn belief in the existence of that Varona treasure had more than once impressed him He wondered now if others shared that faith or if by chance they had discovered a clue to the whereabouts of the money and were conducting a secret search It was a fantastic idea nevertheless Cobo told himself that if people were prying about those deserted premises it was with some object and their actions would warrant observation The presence of the woman a woman with the glow of phosphorus upon her face was puzzling but the whole affair was puzzling He determined to investigate After a time he murmured I should like to see this spirit The sergeant shrugged It was plain from his expression that he could not account for such a desire Another night is coming said he Good I shall visit the place and if I see anything unusual I well I shall believe what you have told me Meanwhile go see
