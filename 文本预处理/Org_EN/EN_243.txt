That night Babbitts O Mally and I left for Quebec Before we went the wires that connected us with the Canadian city had been busy St Foy had been located a house on a suburban road occupied for the last two weeks by an American called Henry Santley Instructions were carried over the hundreds of intervening miles to surround the house to apprehend Santley if he tried to get away and to watch for the lady who would join him that night Unless something unforeseen and unimaginable should occur we had Barker at last As we rushed through the darkness we speculated on the reasons for his last daring move the sending for his daughter O Mally figured it out as the result of a growing confidence he was feeling secure and wanted to help her He had had ample proof of her discretion and had probably some plan for her enrichment that he wanted to communicate to her in person I was of the opinion that he expected to leave the country and intended to take her with him sending back later for the mother He was assured of her trust and affection knew she believed in him and was certain the murder hadn t been and now never would be discovered He could count on safety in Europe and with his vast gains could settle down with his wife and his daughter to a life of splendid ease Well we d see to that The best laid schemes of mice and men The sun was bright the sky sapphire clear as the great rock of Quebec crowned with its fortress roofs came into view The two rivers clasped its base ice banded at the shore and in the middle their dark currents flowing free Snow and snow and snow heaved and billowed on the surrounding hills paved the narrow streets hooded the roofs of the ancient houses Through the air razor edged with cold and crystal clear came the thin broken music of sleigh bells ringing up from every lane and alley jubilant and inspiring and the sleighs low running flew by with the wave of their streaming furs and the flash of scarlet standards Glorious splendid a fit day all sun and color and music for me to come to Carol A man met us at the depot a silent wooden faced policeman of some kind who said yes he thought the lady was there and then piloted us glumly into a sleigh and mounted beside the driver A continuous vague current of sound came from Babbitts and O Mally as we climbed a steep hill with the Frontenac s pinnacled towers looming above us and then shot off down narrow streets where the jingle of the bells was flung back and across echoing and reverberating between the old stone houses It made me think of a phrase the boys in the office used coming with bells We went some distance through the town and out along a road where the buildings drew apart from one another villas and suburban houses behind walls and gardens At a smaller one set back in a muffling of whitened shrubberies the sleigh drew in toward the sidewalk Before the others could disentangle themselves from the furs and robes I was out and racing up the path My eyes ranging hungrily over the house thinking perhaps to see her at one of the windows saw in it something ominous and secretive There was not a sign of life every pane darkened with a lowered blind All about it the snow was heaped and curled in wave like forms as if endeavoring to creep over it to aid in the work of hiding its dark mystery Barker s lair his last stand It looked like it white wrapped silent inscrutable As I leaped up the piazza steps the door was opened by a man in uniform He touched his hat and started to speak but I pushed him aside and came in peering past him down a hall that stretched away to the rear At the sound of his voice a door had opened there and a woman came out For a moment she was only a shadow moving toward me up the dimness of the half lit passage Then I recognized her gave a cry and ran to her My hands found hers and closed on them my eyes looking down into the dark ones raised to them Neither of us spoke it didn t occur to me to explain why I was there and she showed no surprise at seeing me It seemed as if we d known all along we were going to meet in that dark passage in that strange house And standing there silent hand clasped in hand I saw something so wonderful so unexpected that the surroundings faded away and for me there was nothing in the world but what I read in her beautiful lifted face I never had dared to hope never had thought of her as caring for me All I had asked was the right to help and defend her Perhaps under different circumstances when things were happy and easy I d have aspired gone in to try and win But in the last dark month when we d come so close we d only been a woman set upon and menaced and a man braced and steeled to do battle for her Now with her stone cold hands in mine I saw in the shining depths of her eyes Oh no it s too sacred That part of the story is between Carol and me There had been sounds and voices in the vestibule behind us They came vaguely upon my consciousness low and then breaking suddenly into a louder key phrases exclamations questions I don t think if the house had been rocked by an earthquake I d have noticed it and it wasn t till O Mally came down the passage calling me that I dropped her hands and turned His face was creased into an expression of excited consternation and he rapped out not seeing Carol What the devil are you doing there Haven t you heard Then his eye catching her Oh it s Miss Whitehall Well young lady you must have had a pretty tough time here last night She simply drooped her eyelids in faint agreement What do you mean I cried and looked from O Mally s boisterously concerned countenance to Carol s worn white one What is it something more She gave a slight nod and said The last the end this time O Mally wheeled on me She hasn t told you He shot himself here last night shortly after she arrived Before I had time to answer Babbitts and the man in uniform a police inspector were beside us Babbitts was speechless as I was myself but the inspector pompous and stolid answered my look of shocked amazement A few minutes after one Fortunately I d got your instructions and the house was surrounded My men heard the report and the screams and broke in at once I looked blankly from one to the other There was a confused horror in my mind but from the confusion one thought rose clear Barker had done the best the only thing The inspector ostentatiously cool in the midst of our aghast concern volunteered further He didn t die till near morning and we got a full statement out of him For an hour afterward he was as clear as a bell they are that way sometimes and gave us all the particulars seemed to want to I ve got it upstairs and from what I can make out he was one of the sharpest most daring criminals I ever ran up against I ve had the body kept here for your identification Will you come up and see it now He moved off toward the stairs O Mally and Babbitts muttering together filing after him I didn t go but turned to Carol who had thrust one hand through the balustrade that ran up beside where we were standing As the tramp of ascending feet sounded on the first steps she leaned toward me her voice hardly more than a whisper Do you know who it is Who what is I said startled by her words and expression The man upstairs I was terror stricken the experiences of the night had unhinged her mind I tried to take her hand but she drew it back her lips forming words just loud enough for me to hear You don t It s Hollings Harland Carol I cried certain now she was unbalanced She drew farther away from me and slipping her hand from the balustrade pointed up the stairs Go and see It s he There s nothing the matter with me but I want you to see for yourself Go and see and then come back here and I ll tell you I know everything now I went a wild rush up the stairs In a room off the upper hall the light tempered by drawn blinds were O Mally Babbitts and the inspector looking at the dead body of Hollings
