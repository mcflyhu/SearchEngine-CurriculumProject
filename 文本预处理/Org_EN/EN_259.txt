Ah the salt water Miss Welse the strong salt water and the big waves and the heavy boats for smooth or rough that I know But the fresh water and the little canoes egg shells fairy bubbles a big breath a sigh a heart pulse too much and pouf over you go not so that I do not know Baron Courbertin smiled self commiseratingly and went on But it is delightful magnificent I have watched and envied Some day I shall learn It is not so difficult St Vincent interposed Is it Miss Welse Just a sure and delicate poise of mind and body Like the tight rope dancer Oh you are incorrigible Frona laughed I feel certain that you know as much about canoes as we And you know a woman Cosmopolitan as the Frenchman was the independence and ability for doing of the Yankee women were a perpetual wonder to him How When I was a very little girl at Dyea among the Indians But next spring after the river breaks we ll give you your first lessons Mr St Vincent and I So you see you will return to civilization with accomplishments And you will surely love it Under such charming tutorship he murmured gallantly But you Mr St Vincent do you think I shall be so successful that I may come to love it Do you love it you who stand always in the background sparing of speech inscrutable as though able but unwilling to speak from out the eternal wisdom of a vast experience The baron turned quickly to Frona We are old friends did I not tell you So I may what you Americans call josh with him Is it not so Mr St Vincent Gregory nodded and Frona said I am sure you met at the ends of the earth somewhere Yokohama St Vincent cut in shortly eleven years ago in cherry blossom time But Baron Courbertin does me an injustice which stings unhappily because it is not true I am afraid when I get started that I talk too much about myself A martyr to your friends Frona conciliated And such a teller of good tales that your friends cannot forbear imposing upon you Then tell us a canoe story the baron begged A good one A what you Yankees call a hair raiser They drew up to Mrs Schoville s fat wood burning stove and St Vincent told of the great whirlpool in the Box Canyon of the terrible corkscrew in the mane of the White Horse Rapids and of his cowardly comrade who walking around had left him to go through alone nine years before when the Yukon was virgin Half an hour later Mrs Schoville bustled in with Corliss in her wake That hill The last of my breath she gasped pulling off her mittens Never saw such luck she declared none the less vehemently the next moment This play will never come off I never shall be Mrs Linden How can I Krogstad s gone on a stampede to Indian River and no one knows when he ll be back Krogstad to Corliss is Mr Maybrick you know And Mrs Alexander has the neuralgia and can t stir out So there s no rehearsal to day that s flat She attitudinized dramatically Yes in my first terror But a day has passed and in that day I have seen incredible things in this house Helmer must know everything There must be an end to this unhappy secret O Krogstad you need me and I I need you and you are over on the Indian River making sour dough bread and I shall never see you more They clapped their applause My only reward for venturing out and keeping you all waiting was my meeting with this ridiculous fellow She shoved Corliss forward Oh you have not met Baron Courbertin Mr Corliss If you strike it rich baron I advise you to sell to Mr Corliss He has the money bags of Croesus and will buy anything so long as the title is good And if you don t strike sell anyway He s a professional philanthropist you know But would you believe it addressing the general group this ridiculous fellow kindly offered to see me up the hill and gossip along the way gossip though he refused point blank to come in and watch the rehearsal But when he found there wasn t to be any he changed about like a weather vane So here he is claiming to have been away to Miller Creek but between ourselves there is no telling what dark deeds Dark deeds Look Frona broke in pointing to the tip of an amber mouth piece which projected from Vance s outside breast pocket A pipe My congratulations She held out her hand and he shook good humoredly All Del s fault he laughed When I go before the great white throne it is he who shall stand forth and be responsible for that particular sin An improvement nevertheless she argued All that is wanting is a good round swear word now and again Oh I assure you I am not unlearned he retorted No man can drive dogs else I can swear from hell to breakfast by damn and back again if you will permit me to the last link of perdition By the bones of Pharaoh and the blood of Judas for instance are fairly efficacious with a string of huskies but the best of my dog driving nomenclature more s the pity women cannot stand I promise you however in spite of hell and high water Oh Oh Mrs Schoville screamed thrusting her fingers into her ears Madame Baron Courbertin spoke up gravely it is a fact a lamentable fact that the dogs of the north are responsible for more men s souls than all other causes put together Is it not so I leave it to the gentlemen Both Corliss and St Vincent solemnly agreed and proceeded to detonate the lady by swapping heart rending and apposite dog tales St Vincent and the baron remained behind to take lunch with the Gold Commissioner s wife leaving Frona and Corliss to go down the hill together Silently consenting as though to prolong the descent they swerved to the right cutting transversely the myriad foot paths and sled roads which led down into the town It was a mid December day clear and cold and the hesitant high noon sun having laboriously dragged its pale orb up from behind the southern land rim balked at the great climb to the zenith and began its shamefaced slide back beneath the earth Its oblique rays refracted from the floating frost particles till the air was filled with glittering jewel dust resplendent blazing flashing light and fire but cold as outer space They passed down through the scintillant magical sheen their moccasins rhythmically crunching the snow and their breaths wreathing mysteriously from their lips in sprayed opalescence Neither spoke nor cared to speak so wonderful was it all At their feet under the great vault of heaven a speck in the midst of the white vastness huddled the golden city puny and sordid feebly protesting against immensity man s challenge to the infinite Calls of men and cries of encouragement came sharply to them from close at hand and they halted There was an eager yelping a scratching of feet and a string of ice rimed wolf dogs with hot lolling tongues and dripping jaws pulled up the slope and turned into the path ahead of them On the sled a long and narrow box of rough sawed spruce told the nature of the freight Two dog drivers a woman walking blindly and a black robed priest made up the funeral cortege A few paces farther on the dogs were again put against the steep and with whine and shout and clatter the unheeding clay was hauled on and upward to its ice hewn hillside chamber A zone conqueror Frona broke voice Corliss found his thought following hers and answered These battlers of frost and fighters of hunger I can understand how the dominant races have come down out of the north to empire Strong to venture strong to endure with infinite faith and infinite patience is it to be wondered at Frona glanced at him in eloquent silence We smote with our swords he chanted to me it was a joy like having my bright bride by me on the couch I have marched with my bloody sword and the raven has followed me Furiously we fought the fire passed over the dwellings of men we slept in the blood of those who kept the gates But do you feel it Vance she cried her hand flashing out and resting on his arm I begin to feel I think The north has taught me is teaching me The old thing s come back with new significance Yet I do not know It seems a tremendous egotism a magnificent dream But you are not a negro or a Mongol nor are you descended from the negro or Mongol Yes he considered I am my father s son and the line goes back to the sea kings who never slept under the smoky rafters of a roof or drained the ale horn by inhabited hearth There must be a reason for the dead status of the black a reason for the Teuton spreading over the earth as no other race has ever spread There must be something in race heredity else I would not leap at the summons A great race Vance Half of the earth its heritage and all of the sea And in threescore generations it has achieved it all think of it threescore generations and to day it reaches out wider armed than ever The smiter and the destroyer among nations the builder and the law giver Oh Vance my love is passionate but God will forgive for it is good A great race greatly conceived and if to perish greatly to perish Don t you remember Trembles Yggdrasil s ash yet standing groans that ancient tree and the Jotun Loki is loosed The shadows groan on the ways of Hel until the fire of Surt has consumed the tree Hrym steers from the east the waters rise the mundane snake is coiled in jotun rage The worm heats the water and the eagle screams the pale of beak tears carcases the ship Naglfar is loosed Surt from the south comes with flickering flame shines from his sword the Val god s sun Swaying there like a furred Valkyrie above the final carnage of men and gods she touched his imagination and the blood surged exultingly along unknown channels thrilling and uplifting The stony hills are dashed together the giantesses totter men tread the path of Hel and heaven is cloven The sun darkens earth in ocean sinks fall from heaven the bright stars fire s breath assails the all nourishing tree towering fire plays against heaven itself Outlined against the blazing air her brows and lashes white with frost the jewel dust striking and washing against hair and face and the south sun lighting her with a great redness the man saw her as the genius of the race The traditions of the blood laid hold of him and he felt strangely at one with the white skinned yellow haired giants of the younger world And as he looked upon her the mighty past rose before him and the caverns of his being resounded with the shock and tumult of forgotten battles With bellowing of storm winds and crash of smoking North Sea waves he saw the sharp beaked fighting galleys and the sea flung Northmen great muscled deep chested sprung from the elements men of sword and sweep marauders and scourgers of the warm south lands The din of twenty centuries of battle was roaring in his ear and the clamor for return to type strong upon him He seized her hands passionately Be the bright bride by me Frona Be the bright bride by me on the couch She started and looked down at him questioningly Then the import of it reached her and she involuntarily drew back The sun shot a last failing flicker across the earth and vanished The fire went out of the air and the day darkened Far above the hearse dogs howled mournfully No he interrupted as words formed on her lips Do not speak I know my answer your answer now I was a fool Come let us go down It was not until they had left the mountain behind them crossed the flat and come out on the river by the saw mill that the bustle and skurry of human life made it seem possible for them to speak Corliss had walked with his eyes moodily bent to the ground and Frona with head erect and looking everywhere stealing an occasional glance to his face Where the road rose over the log run way of the mill the footing was slippery and catching at her to save her from falling their eyes met I I am grieved she hesitated And then in unconscious self defence It was so I had not expected it just then Else you would have prevented he asked bitterly Yes I think I should have I did not wish to give you pain Then you expected it some time And feared it But I had hoped I Vance I did not come into the Klondike to get married I liked you at the beginning and I have liked you more and more never so much as to day but But you had never looked upon me in the light of a possible husband that is what you are trying to say As he spoke he looked at her side wise and sharply and when her eyes met his with the same old frankness the thought of losing her maddened him But I have she answered at once I have looked upon you in that light but somehow it was not convincing Why I do not know There was so much I found to like in you so much He tried to stop her with a dissenting gesture but she went on So much to admire There was all the warmth of friendship and closer friendship a growing camaraderie in fact but nothing more Though I did not wish more I should have welcomed it had it come As one welcomes the unwelcome guest Why won t you help me Vance instead of making it harder It is hard on you surely but do you imagine that I am enjoying it I feel because of your pain and further I know when I refuse a dear friend for a lover the dear friend goes from me I do not part with friends lightly I see doubly bankrupt friend and lover both But they are easily replaced I fancy I was half lost before I spoke Had I remained silent it would have been the same anyway Time softens new associations new thoughts and faces men with marvellous adventures She stopped him abruptly It is useless Vance no matter what you may say I shall not quarrel with you I can understand how you feel If I am quarrelsome then I had better leave you He halted suddenly and she stood beside him Here comes Dave Harney He will see you home It s only a step You are doing neither yourself nor me kindness She spoke with final firmness I decline to consider this the end We are too close to it to understand it fairly You must come and see me when we are both calmer I refuse to be treated in this fashion It is childish of you She shot a hasty glance at the approaching Eldorado king I do not think I deserve it at your hands I refuse to lose you as a friend And I insist that you come and see me that things remain on the old footing He shook his head Hello Dave Harney touched his cap and slowed down loose jointedly Sorry you didn t take my tip Dogs gone up a dollar a pound since yesterday and still a whoopin Good afternoon Miss Frona and Mr Corliss Goin my way Miss Welse is Corliss touched the visor of his cap and half turned on his heel Where re you off to Dave demanded Got an appointment he lied Remember Frona called to him you must come and see me Too busy I
