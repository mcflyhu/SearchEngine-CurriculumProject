In another week Achilles Alexandrakis had made ready to call on Betty Harris There had been many details to attend to a careful sponging and pressing of his best suit the purchase of a new hat and cuffs and collars of the finest linen nothing was too good for the little lady who had flitted into the dusky shop and out leaving behind her the little line of light Achilles brushed the new hat softly turning it on his supple wrist with gentle pride He took out the music roll from the drawer and unrolled it holding it in light fingers He would carry it back to Betty Harris and he would stay for a while and talk with her of his beloved Athens Outside the sun gleamed The breeze came fresh from the lake As he made his way up the long drive of the Lake Shore the water dimpled in the June sun and little waves lapped the great stones touching the ear with quiet sound It was a clear fresh day with the hint of coming summer in the air To the left stone castles lifted themselves sombrely in the soft day Grim or flaunting they faced the lake castles from Germany castles from France and castles from Spain Achilles eyed them with a little smile as his swift thin feet traversed the long stones There were turrets and towers and battlements frowning upon the peaceful workaday lake Minarets and flowers in stone and heavy marble blocks that gripped the earth Suddenly Achilles s foot slackened its swift pace His eye dropped to the silver tag on the music roll in his hand and lifted itself again to a gleaming red brown house at the left It rose with a kind of lightness from the earth standing poised upon the shore of the lake like some alert swift creature caught in flight brought to bay by the rush of waters Achilles looked at it with gentle eyes a swift pleasure lighting his glance It was a beautiful structure Its red brown front and pointed lifting roof had hardly a Greek line or hint but the spirit that built the Parthenon was in it facing the rippling lake He moved softly across the smooth roadway and leaned against the parapet of stone that guarded the water studying the line and colour of the house that faced him The man who planned it had loved it and as it rose there in the light it was perfect in every detail as it had been conceived with one little exception On either side the doorway crouched massive grey pink lions wrought in stone the heavy outspread paws and firm set haunches resting at royal ease In the original plan these lions had not appeared But in their place had been two steers wide flanked and short horned with lifted heads and nostrils snuffling free something crude brusque perhaps but full of power and quick onslaught The house that rose behind them had been born of the same thought Its pointed gable and its facades its lifted front had the same look of challenge the light firm planted hoofs the springing head were all there in the soft red stone running to brown in the flanks The stock yard owner and his wife had liked the design with no suspicion of the symbol undergirding it The man had liked it all steers and red brown stone and all but the wife had objected She had travelled far and she had seen on a certain building in Rome two lions guarding a ducal entrance Now that the house was finished the architect seldom passed that way But when he did he swore at the lions softly as he whirred by He had done a mighty thing conceived in steel and stone a house that fitted the swift life out of which it came a wind swept place in which it stood and all the stirring troublous times about it There it rose in its spirit of lightness head up lifted and nostrils sniffing the breeze and in front of it squatted two stone lions from the palmy days of Rome He gritted his teeth and drove his machine hard when he passed that way But to Achilles standing with bared head the breeze from the lake touching his forehead the lions were of no account He let them go The spirit of the whole possessed him It was as if a hand had touched him lightly on the shoulder in a crowd staying him A quick breath escaped his lips as he replaced his hat and crossed to the red brown steps He mounted them without a glance at the pink monsters on either hand A light had come into his face The child filled it The stiff butler eyed him severely and the great door seemed ready to close of itself Only something in the poise of Achilles s head a look in his eyes held the hinge waiting a grudging minute while he spoke He lifted his head a little the look in his eyes deepened I am called Miss Elizabeth Harris and her mother to see he said simply The door paused a little and swung back an inch He might be a great savant some scholar of parts an artist They came for the child to examine her to play for her to talk with her Then there was the music roll It took the blundering grammar and the music roll to keep the door open and then it opened wide and Achilles entered following the butler s stateliness up the high dark hall Rich hangings were about them and massive pictures bronzes and statues and curious carvings Inside the house the taste of the mistress had prevailed At the door of a great high ceiled room the butler paused holding back the soft drapery with austere hand What name for madame he said The clear eyes of Achilles met his My name is Achilles Alexandrakis he said quietly The eyes of the butler fell He was struggling with this unexpected morsel in the recesses of his being Plain Mr Alexander would have had small effect upon him but Achilles Alexandrakis He mounted the long staircase holding the syllables in his set teeth Alexandrakis His mistress turned a little puzzled frown upon him What is he like Conner The man considered a safe moment He s a furriner he said addressing the wall before him with impassive jaw A little light crossed her face not a look of pleasure Ask Miss Stone to come to me at once she said The man bowed himself out and departed on silken foot Miss Stone gentle and fluttering and fine grained appeared a moment later in the doorway He has come said the woman without looking up He Miss Stone s lifted eyebrows sought to place him The Greek I told you Oh The Greek It was slow and hesitant It spoke volumes for Miss Stone s state of mind Hours of Greek history were in it and long rows of tombs and temples the Parthenon of gods and goddesses with a few outlying scores of heroes and understudies The Greek she repeated softly The Greek said the woman with decision He has asked for Betty and for me I cannot see him of course You have the club said Miss Stone in soft assent I have the club in ten minutes Her brow wrinkled You will kindly see him And Betty said Miss Stone waiting The child must see him Yes of course She would be heart broken You drive at three she added without emphasis We drive at three repeated Miss Stone She moved quietly away her grey gown a bit of shimmering in the gorgeous rooms She had been chosen for the very qualities that made her seem so curiously out of place for her gentleness and unassuming dignity and a few ancestors The country had been searched for a lady so much the lady that she had never given the matter a thought Miss Stone was the result If Betty had charm and simplicity and instinctive courtesy toward those whom she met it was only what she saw every day in the little grey woman who directed her studies her play her whole life The two were inseparable light and shadow morning and night Betty s mother in the house was the grand lady beautiful to look upon the piece of bronze or picture that went with the house but Miss Stone was Betty s own the little grey voice a bit of heart love and something common and precious They came down the long rooms together the child s hand resting lightly in hers and her steps dancing a little in happy play She had not heard the man s name He was only a wise man whom she was to meet for a few minutes before she and Miss Stone went for their drive The day was full of light outside even in the heavily draped rooms you could feel its presence She was eager to be off out in the sun and air of the great sea of freshness and the light soft wind on her face Then she saw the slim dark man who had risen to meet her and a swift light crossed her face She was coming down the room now both hands out stretched fluttering a little in the quick surprise and joy Then the hands stayed themselves and she advanced demurely to meet him but the hand that lifted itself to his seemed to sing like a child s hand in spite of the princess I am glad you have come she said This is Miss Stone She seated herself beside him her eyes on his face her little feet crossed at the ankle Have you any new fruit to day she asked politely He smiled a little and drew a soft flat white bit of tissue from his pocket undoing it fold on fold till in the centre lay a grey green leaf The child bent above it with pleased glance Her eyes travelled to his face He nodded quickly I thought of you It is the Eastern citron See He lifted the leaf and held it suspended It hangs like this and the fruit is blue grey blue like His eye travelled about the elaborate room He shook his head slowly Then his glance fell on the grey gown of Miss Stone as it fell along the rug at her feet and he bowed with gracious appeal for permission Like the dress of madame he said but warmer like the sun and blue A low colour crept up into the soft line of Miss Stone s cheek and rested there She sat watching the two with slightly puzzled eyes She was a lady kindly and gracious to the world but she could not have thought of anything to say to this fruit peddler who had seemed for days and weeks to be tumbling all Greek civilisation about her head The child was chatting with him as if she had known him always They had turned to each other again and were absorbed in the silken leaf the man talking in soft broken words the child piecing out the half finished phrase with quick nod and gesture her little voice running in and out along the words like ripples of light on some dark surface The face of Achilles had grown strangely radiant Miss Stone as she looked at it again was almost startled at the change The sombre look had vanished Quick lights ran in it and little thoughts that met the child s and laughed They are two children together thought Miss Stone as she watched them I have never seen the child so happy She must see him again She sat with her hands folded in her grey lap a little apart watching the pretty scene and happy in it but outside it all untouched and grey and
