Simon Harlow he began was the owner of the famous Clos du Prince vineyards on the C te d Or to the east of Dijon He had an estate in Norfolk this big house the Maison Crenelle in Dijon and a villa at Monte Carlo But he spent most of his time in Dijon where at the age of forty five he married a French lady Jeanne Marie Raviart There was I believe quite a little romance about the affair Jeanne Marie was married and separated from her husband and Simon Harlowe waited I think for ten years until the husband Raviart died Jim Frobisher moved quickly and Mr Haslitt who seemed to be reading off this history in the pattern of the carpet looked up Yes I see what you mean he said replying to Jim s movement Yes there might have been some sort of affair between those two before they were free to marry But nowadays my dear Jim Opinion takes a more human view than it did in my youth Besides don t you see this little secret to be of any value to Boris Waberski must be near enough to Betty Harlowe I don t say to affect her if published but to make Waberski think that she would hate to have it published Now Betty Harlowe doesn t come into the picture at all until two years after Simon and Jeanne Marie were married when it became clear that they were not likely to have any children No the love affairs of Simon Harlowe are sufficiently remote for us to leave them aside Jim Frobisher accepted the demolition of his idea with a flush of shame I was a fool to think of it he said Not a bit replied Mr Haslitt cheerfully Let us look at every possibility That s the only way which will help us to get a glimpse of the truth I resume then Simon Harlowe was a collector Yes he had a passion for collecting and a very catholic one His one sitting room at the Maison Crenelle was a perfect treasure house not only of beautiful things but of out of the way things too He liked to live amongst them and do his work amongst them His married life did not last long For he died five years ago at the age of fifty one Mr Haslitt s eyes once more searched for recollections amongst the convolutions of the carpet That s really about all I know of him He was a pleasant fellow enough but not very sociable No there s nothing to light a candle for us there I am afraid Mr Haslitt turned his thoughts to the widow Jeanne Marie Harlowe he said It s extraordinary how little I know about her now I come to count it up Natural too though For she sold the Norfolk estate and has since passed her whole time between Monte Carlo and Dijon and oh yes a little summer house on the C te d Or amongst her vineyards She was left rich I suppose Frobisher asked Very well off at all events Mr Haslitt replied The Clos du Prince Burgundy has a fine reputation but there s not a great deal of it Did she come to England ever Never said Mr Haslitt She was content it seems with Dijon though to my mind the smaller provincial towns of France are dull enough to make one scream However she was used to it and then her heart began to trouble her and for the last two years she has been an invalid There s nothing to help us there And Mr Haslitt looked across to Jim for confirmation Nothing said Jim Then we are only left the child Betty Harlowe and oh yes your correspondent your voluminous correspondent Ann Upcott Who is she Jim Where did she spring from How does she find herself in the Maison Crenelle Come confess young man and Mr Haslitt archly looked at his junior partner Why should Boris Waberski expect her support Jim Frobisher threw his arms wide I haven t an idea he said I have never seen her I have never heard of her I never knew of her existence until that letter came this morning with her name signed at the end of it Mr Haslitt started up He crossed the room to his table and fixing his folding glasses on the bridge of his nose he bent over the letter But she writes to you Jim he objected Dear Mr Frobisher she writes She doesn t address the firm at all and he waited looking at Jim expecting him to withdraw this denial Jim however only shook his head It s the most bewildering thing he replied I can t make head or tail of it and Mr Haslitt could not doubt now that he spoke the truth so utterly and frankly baffled the young man was Why should Ann Upcott write to me I have been asking myself that question for the last half hour And why didn t Betty Harlowe write to you who have had her affairs in your care Ah That last question helped Mr Haslitt to an explanation His face took a livelier expression The answer to that is in Waberski s the second letter Betty she snap her fingers at his awkwardnesses She doesn t take the charge seriously She will have left it to the French notary to dispose of it Yes I think that makes Ann Upcott s letter to you intelligible too The ceremonies of the Law in a foreign country would frighten a stranger as this girl is apparently more than they would Betty Harlowe who has lived for four years in the midst of them So she writes to the first name in the title of the firm and writes to him as a man That s it Jim and the old man rubbed his hands together in his satisfaction A girl in terror wouldn t get any comfort out of writing to an abstraction She wants to know that she s in touch with a real person So she writes Dear Mr Frobisher That s it You can take my word for it Mr Haslitt walked back to his chair But he did not sit down in it he stood with his hands in his pockets looking out of the window over Frobisher s head But that doesn t bring us any nearer to finding out what is Boris Waberski s strong suit does it We haven t a clue to it he said ruefully To both of the men indeed Mr Haslitt s flat unillumined narrative of facts without a glimpse into the characters of any of the participants in the little drama seemed the most unhelpful thing Yet the whole truth was written there the truth not only of Waberski s move but of all the strange terrors and mysteries into which the younger of the two men was now to be plunged Jim Frobisher was to recognise that when shaken to the soul he resumed his work in the office For it was interrupted now Mr Haslitt looking out of the window over his partner s head saw a telegraph boy come swinging across the square and hesitate in the roadway below I expect that s a telegram for us he said with the hopeful anticipation people in trouble have that something from outside will happen and set them right Jim turned round quickly The boy was still upon the pavement examining the numbers of the houses We ought to have a brass plate upon the door said Jim with a touch of impatience and Mr Haslitt s eyebrows rose half the height of his forehead towards his thick white hair He was really distressed by the Waberski incident but this suggestion and from a partner in the firm shocked him like a sacrilege My dear boy what are you thinking of he expostulated I hope I am not one of those obstinate old fogies who refuse to march with the times We have had as you know a telephone instrument recently installed in the junior clerks office I believe that I myself proposed it But a brass plate upon the door My dear Jim Let us leave that to Harley Street and Southampton Row But I see that telegram is for us The tiny Mercury with the shako and red cord to his uniform made up his mind and disappeared into the hall below The telegram was brought upstairs and Mr Haslitt tore it open He stared at it blankly for a few seconds then without a word but with a very anxious look in his eyes he handed it to Jim Frobisher Jim Frobisher read Please please send some one to help me at once The Prefect of Police has called in Hanaud a great detective of the S r t in Paris They must think me guilty Betty Harlowe The telegram fluttered from Jim s fingers to the floor It was like a cry for help at night coming from a great distance I must go sir by the night boat he said To be sure said Mr Haslitt a little absently Jim however had enthusiasm enough for both His chivalry was fired as is the way with lonely men by the picture his imagination drew The little girl Betty Harlowe What age was she Twenty one Not a day more She had been wandering with all the proud indifference of her sex and youth until suddenly she found her feet caught in some trap set by a traitor and looked about her and terror came and with it a wild cry for help Girls never notice danger signals he said No they walk blindly into the very heart of catastrophe Who could tell what links of false and cunning evidence Boris Waberski had been hammering away at in the dark to slip swiftly at the right moment over her wrist and ankle And with that question he was seized with a great discouragement We know very little of Criminal Procedure even in our own country in this office he said regretfully Happily said Mr Haslitt with some tartness With him it was the Firm first and last Messrs Frobisher Haslitt never went in to the Criminal Courts Litigation indeed even of the purest kind was frowned upon It is true there was a small special staff under the leadership of an old managing clerk tucked away upon an upper floor like an unpresentable relation in a great house which did a little of that kind of work But it only did it for hereditary clients and then as a favour However said Mr Haslitt as he noticed Jim s discomfort I haven t a doubt my boy that you will be equal to whatever is wanted But remember there s something at the back of this which we here don t know Jim shifted his position rather abruptly This cry of the old man was becoming parrot like a phrase a formula Jim was thinking of the girl in Dijon and hearing her piteous cry for help She was not snapping her the fingers now It s a matter of common sense Mr Haslitt insisted Take a comparison Bath for instance would never call in Scotland Yard over a case of this kind There would have to be the certainty of a crime first and then grave doubt as to who was the criminal This is a case for an autopsy and the doctors If they call in this man Hanaud and he stopped He picked the telegram up from the floor and read it through again Yes Hanaud he repeated his face clouding and growing bright and clouding again like a man catching at and just missing a very elusive recollection He gave up the pursuit in the end Well Jim you had better take the two letters of Waberski and Ann Upcott s three volume novel and Betty s telegram he gathered the papers together and enclosed them in a long envelope and I shall expect you back again with a smiling face in a very few days I should like to see our little Boris when he is asked to explain those letters Mr Haslitt gave the envelope to Jim and rang his bell There is some one waiting to see me I think he said to the clerk who answered it The clerk named a great landowner who had been kicking his heels during the last half hour in an undusted waiting room with a few mouldy old Law books in a battered glass case to keep him company You can show him in now said Mr Haslitt as Jim retired to his own office and when the great landowner entered he merely welcomed him with a reproach You didn t make an appointment did you he said But all through that interview though his advice was just the precise clear advice for which the firm was quietly famous Mr Haslitt s mind was still playing hide and seek with a memory catching glimpses of the fringes of its skirt as it gleamed and vanished Memory is a woman he said to himself If I don t run after her she will come of her own accord But he was in the common case of men with women he could not but run after her Towards the end of the interview however his shoulders and head moved with a little jerk and he wrote a word down on a slip of paper As soon as his client had gone he wrote a note and sent it off by a messenger who had orders to wait for an answer The messenger returned within the hour and Mr Haslitt hurried to Jim Frobisher s office Jim had just finished handing over his affairs to various clerks and was locking up the drawers of his desk Jim I have remembered where I have heard the name of this man Hanaud before You have met Julius Ricardo He s one of our clients Yes said Frobisher I remember him a rather finnicking person in Grosvenor Square That s the man He s a friend of Hanaud and absurdly proud of the friendship He and Hanaud were somehow mixed up in a rather scandalous crime some time ago at Aix les Bains I think Well Ricardo will give you a letter of introduction to him and tell you something about him if you will go round to Grosvenor Square at five this afternoon Capital said Jim Frobisher He kept the appointment and was told how he must expect to be awed at one moment leaped upon unpleasantly at the next ridiculed at a third and treated with great courtesy and friendship at the fourth Jim discounted Mr Ricardo s enthusiasm but he got the letter and crossed the Channel that night On the journey it occurred to him that if Hanaud was a man of such high mark he would not be free even at an urgent call to pack his bags and leave for the provinces in an instant Jim broke his journey therefore at Paris and in the course of the morning found his way to the Direction of the S r t on the Quai d Horloge just behind the Palais de Justice Monsieur Hanaud he asked eagerly and the porter took his card and his letter of introduction The great man was still in Paris then he thought with relief He was taken to a long dark corridor lit with electric globes even on that bright morning of early summer There he rubbed elbows with malefactors and gendarmes for half an hour whilst his confidence in himself ebbed away Then a bell rang and a policeman in plain clothes went up to him One side of the corridor was lined with a row of doors It is for you sir said the policeman and he led Frobisher to one of the doors and opened it and stood aside Frobisher straightened his shoulders and marched in villa n We rented a villa in France for the summer
