The morning she came was the morning Eric said good bye just for a few days he dreaming as little as we of what those few days were to bring And so ignorant of what I was facing I was almost happy in spite of the parting because of what Eric said to me that last Monday morning The cart had been ordered to go for Madame Aurore at Directly after breakfast my mother and Bettina set about trimming hats a business in which they scorned my help I had something particular to finish in the garden I went on digging up the bare patches on the south bank sharing the delight of all things growing and blowing and flying under the glorious cloud piled sky of May I listened intently as I worked to that orchestra of tiny sound underneath the loud birds singing The spring unlike last year s had been cold and late many days like this with crisp air and fitful sunshine Only here in the sheltered south west corner were[Pg ] the bees in any number tuning up their fiddles I looked up from my work and saw at that most unusual hour Eric Annan at the gate I saw too that he looked odd excited I dropped the garden fork What is the matter I said Matter What should be the matter I only smiled It was so like Eric not to be pleased at hearing he had betrayed himself I thought you looked as if as if something had happened I said What I meant was as if something were about to happen Only one thing I thought could make Eric look like that make him interrupt his precious morning one thing alone could have grown so great overnight that the heart of man could not conceal it or contain it for another hour But even if my hopes were not misleading me I felt that Eric would not like my having guessed so much To hide my eyes from him I bent down over my basket I lifted out tufts of aromatic green and set them firmly in the loosened soil I pressed the earth down tight about their roots What are you planting there he asked Re planting the wild thyme I said Something had killed it last year [Pg ] Where do you find wild thyme he asked I told him how far I had to go for it And when Before breakfast He looked astonished I did not like to explain that I had got into the habit of waking early to study And now that studying was no use I spent the time in taking delicious walks in the early morning before other people were awake I confessed the walks You ought not to have told me he said Why Because for these next days I can t come too I went on planting thyme Promise me for these next days you won t go either Why I asked again Because my thoughts might go wandering I nudged the wild thyme and we both smiled secretly I can t afford just at this moment to have anything distracting me He said this in an anxious almost appealing way Very well I answered I won t go early walks for the next how many days am I to be[Pg ] cooped up when the morning is at its best Oh not long Then with that impatience of his if you were doing other things while he was there How much more of that stuff are you going to put in All there is I said provokingly And I did not hurry Why must you have wild thyme there he grumbled So as not to disappoint the blue butterflies I said gravely They know a bank and this is it They ve had an understanding with my mother about it for years If they don t find thyme here they re annoyed They go on dying out My mother says a world without blue butterflies would be a poor sort of place We talked irrelevancies for a moment more the passion of the convolvulus moth for petunias and the other flowers the different sorts of moths and butterflies preferred He was surprised to hear that for years my mother had taken all that trouble to please even the ordinary red admirals and spotted footmen and painted ladies I explained that I was re planting this thyme only to please my mother [Pg ] Personally I had never bothered much about the butterfly garden I said in what he promptly called a superior tone I maintained that the pampered creatures were dreadful slackers and sybarites all for colour and sweet scents He stood listening a moment to the bees band playing in the rhododendron concert and then he defended the butterflies Butterflies were much misunderstood In their way and a very good way too they answer to the call What call The call to serve the ends of life I looked up surprised from my fresh thyme patch for general moralisings were not much in Eric s way What are the ends of life More life There was a moment s pause Then he said butterflies were no more idle than bees and birds Besides attending to their more immediate affairs they were pollen bringers It was such solemn talk for butterflies I told him the two sulphur yellows reeling in the sunshine were laughing at him Ends of life indeed They simply love bright colour and things that smell sweet [Pg ] Of course they love them Then he said something that sank deeper than any single sentence I ever heard Hating never created anything all life comes from lovers At the moment that great saying only frightened me And the strange thing was it seemed to frighten him We were very still for a moment I thought even the little music of the honey bees had slackened I and all the world waited holding breath Then a gust of wind veered round the corner and Eric turned up his collar He asked if I wasn t cold I was anything but cold But I had noticed that after his long hours of motionless concentration indoors Eric was very sensitive to chill So I put off planting the rest of the thyme and I took Eric up to the morning room What is he going to tell me I asked myself
