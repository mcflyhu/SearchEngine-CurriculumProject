At the uncertain and somewhat icy dawn he awoke in his little room in the inn with a persistent impression of his joy on the day before instead of the confused anguish which accompanied so often in him the progressive return of his thoughts Outside were sounds of bells of cattle starting for the pastures of cows lowing to the rising sun of church bells and already against the wall of the large square the sharp snap of the Basque pelota all the noises of a Pyrenean village beginning again its customary life for another day And all this seemed to Ramuntcho the early music of a day s festival At an early hour they returned Arrochkoa and he to their little wagon and crushing their caps against the wind started their horse at a gallop on the roads powdered with white frost At Etchezar where they arrived at noon one would have thought it was summer so beautiful was the sun In the little garden in front of her house Gracieuse sat on a stone bench I have spoken to Arrochkoa said Ramuntcho to her with a happy smile as soon as they were alone And he is entirely with us you know Oh that replied the little girl without losing the sadly pensive air which she had that morning oh that my brother Arrochkoa I suspected it it was sure A pelota player like you you should know was made to please him in his mind there is nothing superior to that But your mother Gatchutcha for several days has acted much better to me I think For example Sunday you remember when I asked you to dance Oh don t trust to that my Ramuntcho you mean day before yesterday after the high mass It was because she had just talked with the Mother Superior have you not noticed And the Mother Superior had insisted that I should not dance with you on the square then only to be contrary you understand But don t rely on that no Oh replied Ramuntcho whose joy had already gone it is true that they are not very friendly Friendly mama and the Mother Superior Like a dog and a cat yes Since there was talk of my going into the convent do you not remember that story He remembered very well on the contrary and it frightened him still The smiling and mysterious black nuns had tried once to attract to the peace of their houses that little blonde head exalted and willful possessed by an immense necessity to love and to be loved Gatchutcha you are always at the sisters or with them why so often explain this to me they are very agreeable to you The sisters no my Ramuntcho especially those of the present time who are new in the country and whom I hardly know for they change them often you know The sisters no I will even tell you that I am like mama about the Mother Superior I cannot endure her Well then what No but what will you I like their songs their chapels their houses everything I cannot explain that to you Anyway boys do not understand anything The little smile with which she said this was at once extinguished changed into a contemplative expression or an absent expression which Ramuntcho had often seen in her She looked attentively in front of her although there were on the road only the leafless trees the brown mass of the crushing mountain but it seemed as if Gracieuse was enraptured in melancholy ecstasy by things perceived beyond them by things which the eyes of Ramuntcho could not distinguish And during their silence the angelus of noon began to ring throwing more peace on the tranquil village which was warming itself in the winter sun then bending their heads they made naively together their sign of the cross Then when ceased to vibrate the holy bell which in the Basque villages interrupts life as in the Orient the song of the muezzins Ramuntcho decided to say It frightens me Gatchutcha to see you in their company always I cannot but ask myself what ideas are in your head Fixing on him the profound blackness of her eyes she replied in a tone of soft reproach It is you talking to me in that way after what we have said to each other Sunday night If I were to lose you yes then perhaps surely even But until then oh no oh you may rest in peace my Ramuntcho He bore for a long time her look which little by little brought back to him entire delicious confidence and at last he smiled with a childish smile Forgive me he asked I say silly things often you know That at least is the truth Then one heard the sound of their laughter which in two different intonations had the same freshness and the same youthfulness Ramuntcho with an habitual brusque and graceful gesture changed his waistcoat from one shoulder to the other pulled his cap on the side and with no other farewell than a sign of the head they separated for Dolores was coming from the end of the road persistent adj Albert had a persistent headache that lasted for three days She felt embarrassed by
