It must be remembered that I had spent all my leisure during the winter in reading and studying the problem of our country life Therefore I knew that March was the best month for pruning trees and I had gained a fairly correct idea how to do this work Until within the last two or three years of his life old Mr Jamison had attended to this task quite thoroughly and thus little was left for me beyond sawing away the boughs that had recently died and cutting out the useless sprouts on the larger limbs Before leaving the city I had provided myself with such tools as I was sure I should need and finding a ladder under a shed I attacked the trees vigorously The wind had almost died out and I knew I must make the most of all still days in this gusty month After playing around for a time Winnie and Bobsey concluded that gathering and piling up my prunings would be as good fun as anything else and so I had helpers again By the middle of the afternoon Mr Jones appeared and I was glad to see him for there were some kinds of work about which I wanted his advice At one end of the garden were several rows of blackcap raspberry bushes which had grown into an awful snarl The old canes that had borne fruit the previous season were still standing ragged and unsightly the new stalks that would bear the coming season sprawled in every direction and I had found that many tips of the branches had grown fast in the ground I took my neighbor to see this briery wilderness and asked his advice Have you got a pair of pruning nippers he asked Before going to the house to get them I blew a shrill whistle to summon Merton for I wished him also to hear all that Mr Jones might say I carried a little metallic whistle one blast on which was for Merton two for Winnie and three for Bobsey When they heard this call they were to come as fast as their feet could carry them Taking the nippers Mr Jones snipped off from one third to one half the length of the branches from one of the bushes and cut out the old dead cane I raise these berries myself for home use he said and I can tell you they go nice with milk for a July supper You see after taking off so much from these long branches the canes stand straight up and will be self supporting no matter how many berries they bear but here and there s a bush that has grown slant wise or is broken off Now if I was you I d take a crow bar n make a hole longside these weakly and slantin fellers put in a stake and tie em up strong Then soon as the frost yields if you ll get out the grass and weeds that s started among em you ll have a dozen bushel or more of marketable berries from this ere wilderness as you call it Give Merton a pair of old gloves and he can do most of the job Every tip that s fast in the ground is a new plant If you want to set out another patch I ll show you how later on I think I know pretty nearly how to do that Yes yes I know Books are a help I s pose but after you ve seen one plant set out right you ll know more than if you d a read a month Well now that you re here Mr Jones I m going to make the most of you How about those other raspberries off to the southeast of the house Those are red ones Let s take a look at em Having reached the patch we found almost as bad a tangle as in the blackcap patch except that the canes were more upright in their growth and less full of spines or briers It s plain enough continued Mr Jones that old man Jamison was too poorly to take much care of things last year You see these red raspberries grow different from those black ones yonder Those increase by the tips of the branches takin root these by suckers All these young shoots comin up between the rows are suckers and they ought to be dug out As I said before you can set them out somewhere else if you want to Dig em up you know make a trench in some out of the way place and bury the roots till you want em Like enough the neighbors will buy some if they know you have em to spare Only be sure to cut these long canes back to within six inches of the ground Yes I said that s all just as I have read in the books So much the better for the books then I haven t lived in this fruit growin region all my life without gettin some ideas as to what s what I give my mind to farmin but Jamison and I were great cronies and I used to be over here every day or two and so it s natural to keep comin That s my good luck Well p raps it ll turn out so Now Merton s just the right age to help you in all this work Jamison you see grew these raspberries in a continuous bushy row that is say three good strong canes every eighteen inches apart in the row and the rows five feet apart so he could run a horse cultivator between Are you catchin on Merton Yes sir said the boy with much interest Well all these suckers and extra plants that are swampin the ground are just as bad as weeds Dig em all out only don t disturb the roots of the bearin canes you leave in the rows much How about trimming these I asked Well that depends If you want early fruit you ll let em stand as they be if you want big berries you ll cut em back one third Let me see Here s five rows of Highland Hardy miserable poor tastin kind but they come so early that they often pay the best Let them stand with their whole length of cane and if you can scatter a good top dressin of fine manure scraped up from the barnyard you ll make the berries larger Those other rows of Cuthbert Reliance and Turner cut back the canes one third and you ll get a great deal more fruit than if you left more wood on em Cuttin back ll make the berries big and so they ll bring as much p raps as if they were early Well Merton this all accords with what I ve read only Mr Jones makes it much clearer I think we know how to go to work now and surely there s plenty to do Yes indeed resumed Mr Jones and you ll soon find the work crowdin you Now come to the big raspberry patch back of the barn the patch where the canes are all laid down as I told you These are Hudson River Antwerps Most people have gone out of em but Jamison held on and he was makin money on em So may you They are what we call tender you see and in November they must be bent down close to the ground and covered with earth or else every cane would be dead from frost by spring About the first week in April if the weather s mild you must uncover em and tie em to stakes durin the month Now Mr Jones one other good turn and we won t bother you any more to day All the front of the house is covered by two big grape vines that have not been trimmed and there are a great many other vines on the place I ve read and read on the subject but I declare I m afraid to touch them Now you re beyond my depth I ve got a lot of vines home and I trim em in my rough way but I know I ain t scientific and we have pretty poor scraggly bunches They taste just as good though and I don t raise any to sell There s a clever man down near the landin who has a big vineyard and he s trimmed it as your vines ought to have been long ago I d advise you to go and see him and he can show you all the latest wrinkles in prunin Now I ll tell you what I come for in the first place You ll remember that I said there d be a vandoo to morrow I ve been over and looked at the stock offered There s a lot of chickens as I told you a likely looking cow with a calf at her side a fairish and quiet old horse that ought to go cheap but he d answer well the first year Do you think you ll get more n one horse to start with No you said I could hire such heavy plowing as was needed at a moderate sum and I think we can get along with one horse for a time My plan is to go slow and I hope sure That s the best way only it ain t common I ll be around in the mornin for you and such of the children as you ll take On one condition Mr Jones You must let me pay you for your time and trouble Unless you ll do this in giving me my start I ll have to paddle my own canoe even if I sink it Oh I ve no grudge against an honest penny turned in any way that comes handy You and I can keep square as we go along You can give me what you think is right and if I ain t satisfied I ll say so I soon learned that my neighbor had no foolish sensitiveness I could pay him what I thought the value of his services and he pocketed the money without a word Of course I could not pay him what his advice was really worth
