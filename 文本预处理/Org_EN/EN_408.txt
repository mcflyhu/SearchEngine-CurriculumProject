Slowly the look on his face grew to something hard and round and bright His lips tightened is that all Good bye His voice sounded in the tube and was gone and he hung up the receiver They make it twenty thousand for one hour he said drily Achilles bent forward his face on fire his finger pointing to the Thing They are right there said the man He gave a short laugh Can t trace them that way we have tried They ve tapped a wire Central is after them But they won t get em that way Sit down and I will talk to you He motioned again to the chair and the Greek seated himself bending forward a little to catch the murmur and half incoherent jerks that the man spoke Now and then the Greek nodded or his dark face lighted and once or twice he spoke But for the most part it was a rapid monologue told in breathless words The great Philip Harris had no hope that the ignorant man sitting before him could help him But there was a curious relief in talking to him and as he talked he found the story shaping itself in his mind things related fell into place and things apart came suddenly together The story ran back for years there had been earlier attempts but the child had been guarded with strictest care and lately they had come to feel secure They had thought the band was broken up The blow had fallen out of a clear sky They had not the slightest clue all day the detectives had gathered the great city in their hands and sifted it through careful fingers A dozen men had been arrested but there was no clue The New York men were on the way they would arrive in the morning and meantime the great man sat in his bare room helpless He looked into the dark eyes opposite him and found a curious comfort there The child knew you he said Yes she know me We love said Achilles simply The other smiled a little It would not have occurred to him to say that Betty loved him He was not sure that she did as he thought of it She had always the quick smile for him and for everyone But there had been no time for foolishness between him and Betty He had hardly known her for the last year or two He shifted a little in his place shading his eyes from the light and looked at the Greek The Greek rose and stood before him I go now he said Philip Harris made no reply He was thinking behind his hand and his mind wrenched from its stockyards and its corners and deals seemed to be groping toward a point of light that glimmered somewhere mistily He could not focus it The darkness tricked him but somehow vaguely the Greek held a clue He had known the child Don t go said Philip Harris looking up at last I find her said Achilles Philip Harris shook his head You cannot find her He said it bitterly But you can tell me sit down He leaned forward Now tell me everything you know about her The face of Achilles lighted She was a nice child he said blithely The man smiled Yes go on So the voice of Achilles was loosened and he told of Betty Harris to her father sitting absorbed and silent The delight of her walk her little hands the very tones of her voice were in his words And the big man listened with intent face Once the telephone rang and he stopped to take down something No clue he said go on And Achilles s voice took up the story again His hands reached out in the words quick gestures made a halo about them lips and smiles spoke and ran the words to a laugh that made the child s presence in the room The father listened dumbly Then silence fell in the room and the clock ticked And while the two men sat in silence something came between them and knit them And when Achilles rose to go the great man held out his hand simply You have helped me he said I help yes said Achilles Then he turned his head A door across the room had opened and a woman stood in it looking at them bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them murmur n v They paid the extra taxes without a murmur There was a low murmur of conversation in the hall spoke n v speak They sourced the spoke nuts from our company The spokes of a wheel are the bars that connect the outer ring to the centre monologue n The comedian gave a long monologue of jokes He went into a long monologue sifted v sift She sifted through her papers to find the lost letter She sifted thistles through her thistle sifter wrenched v wrench The bag was wrenched from her grasp He wrenched the book from her hands glimmered v glimmer There glimmered the embroidered letter with comfort in its unearthly ray The moon glimmered faintly through the mists vaguely adv He had talked vaguely of going to work abroad He looked vaguely before him with unseeing eyes blithely adv They blithely carried on chatting ignoring the customers who were waiting to be served He blithely ignored her protests and went on talking as if all were agreed between them
