A roaring black cloud that looked almost like the vortex of a tornado swirled over the log barn There was a smaller cloud hovering about the house and the whole clearing was alive with bees coming and going looking for something all extremely irritable Approaching the barn as closely as they dared they saw that the whole building was like a vast beehive The insects covered the logs they swarmed in and out of every one of the wide chinks between the timbers Myriads were continually emerging and flying off and myriads more took their places Gracious exclaimed Carl looking rather wildly at his brother I didn t know we had so many bees The honey s here in the barn all right It won t be here long at this rate returned Bob But I wonder what s happened to Larue and his family and live stock Perhaps they re all dead The boys really felt seriously uneasy at the overwhelming success of their scheme Except for the bees no living creature was in sight but Carl presently spied a dead hen near the barn Evidently she had been killed by the bees and this increased their uneasiness Bob made an attempt to reach the cabin but a host of savage bees drove him back despite his veil The insects were fighting mad The boys crept around the edge of the clearing keeping in the shelter of the woods where the bees did not molest them They had made about half the circuit when they caught sight of a heavy cloud of smoke rising a little way back among the thickets S sh There they are whispered Bob They lay low for a minute then hearing no sound crept up close enough to gain a view of the camp The squatter s family were sitting dejectedly in the shelter of smoke from a heavy smudge Larue himself reclined against a tree but he was hardly recognizable Both his eyes seemed to be swollen shut He had two big lumps on his forehead his lips were puffed and one ear was twice its rightful size It was clear that he was in no fighting condition and the boys walked up without any hesitation You seem to be having trouble said Bob innocently The squatter tried to screw his eyes open far enough to get a glimpse of them Nom d un nom he ejaculated thickly through his swollen lips Dose bees Dey come dey swarm and he trailed off into a mixture of French and English indistinguishably distorted in his puffy mouth They could hardly make out a word What s been happening Mrs Larue said Carl turning to the woman She also bore marks of stings and so did the two children Your bees she cried Dey come in by t ousands millions We stay in de house no Pas possible Dey kill my two best poulets Kill us too if we not get out What do you suppose they could have been after asked Bob The woman cast a quick glance at her husband and said she didn t know but in her queer dialect she gave an excited account of what had happened from her point of view That forenoon they had suddenly been invaded by a whirlwind of bees The family had tried at first to shut themselves up in the house but the bees forced an entrance through hundreds of crevices and they had had to take to the woods Larue had been terribly stung while trying to get a cow out of the barn and two hens had been killed by the bees Afraid to leave cover the family had been sitting all day under the smudge smoke without food not daring to go to the house to find any She knew of course that these were the Harman bees but the boys were relieved to find that she seemed to have no sort of suspicion that the raid had been planned We must get this thing stopped whispered Carl drawing his brother aside The bees ll kill everything on the place Yes and after dark we can carry away the rest of the honey ourselves replied Bob These people won t try to stop us In fact now will be a good time to try to make up a peace with them You ll be all right by to morrow Mr Larue said Carl reassuringly Perhaps you know better than we do what attracted the bees down here but we ll try to fix it so they won t bother you any more I move away from zis place cried the squatter energetically Ze bee he make my life one misery Well I m sorry it happened returned Bob Here s a dollar to pay for your two hens and we ll send you some honey for the children The woman took the dollar bill muttered a word of thanks but did not seem much propitiated As for stopping the raid the boys could do nothing till the bees stopped of themselves for the night It was really dangerous to venture out of the shelter of the woods Even sunset brought little cessation of the uproar and it was not till it was quite dark that the bees gradually ceased to hover about the barn and cabin Bob and Carl then accompanied the Larues to their house which was strewn with dead and half dead bees On the table were several unmistakable pieces of section honey which the boys wisely pretended not to see No doubt Larue had brought them in for breakfast but the bees had taken all the honey out of the combs After finishing the honey they had licked up everything sweet in the house including two quarts of maple syrup and a jar of raspberry jam The barefooted children were at once stung by treading on the stupefied bees that crawled over the floor Larue flung himself down on the bed and started up again instantly with a loud ejaculation There were bees in the bed too The woman took a broom and began to sweep the insects out but the boys judged it more politic not to stay Can you lend us a lantern inquired Bob We want to look into the barn There s some honey of ours there that we want to take away When it s gone the bees will leave you alone Oui I get you ze lantern said the woman Look in ze barn Look anywhere But I see no honey I know nottings about it I get you anyt ing only you take dose bees away Though the bees had ceased flying there were many of them still crawling about the log barn and in the lantern light they perceived a big pile of something lightly covered with hay There it is exclaimed Carl with satisfaction It was indeed the stolen shipping cases and supers and the hay covering had not prevented the bees from getting at them At a glance the honey seemed to be all there At the worst not many of the sections were missing though the honey was presumably all cleaned out of them There were a good many bees still in the boxes and the floor was covered with dead insects Evidently they had fought ferociously over the plunder Quite a load of stuff to take home in the boat remarked Carl as they surveyed the rescued honey Yes but if all the honey is out of it it won t be heavy I fancy said Bob I saw an old wheelbarrow around here and we ll use it to take the stuff to the boat We absolutely must get it all home to night before these people recover from their shock The top cases of honey were indeed light and seemed to contain nothing but empty combs hardly that in fact for the wax sifted out in fine powder for it had been torn to pieces by the frenzied bees But as they went deeper the boxes grew heavier some of them seemed almost full weight though no doubt they were all damaged enough to be unsaleable It took three boat loads to get the honey back home and it was hard and heavy work pulling it up against the current Alice was jubilant and when they came up with the second load she had a supper of bacon trout cold partridge and hot coffee ready for them They needed it food had never tasted so good and after finishing everything in sight they went back for the last load We ought to bring those six hives of bees home too said Carl uneasily I suppose we should but who cares replied Bob I m dead tired and I wouldn t row up that river again for a whole apiary Larue doesn t know where they are We ll bring them up at sunrise in the morning I m going to bed But it was then considerably after midnight The boys overslept and did not waken till eight o clock The bees at home were flying already showing signs of much excitement and could be seen going down the river as on the day before They were still looking for stolen honey Won t they hang around and bother the Frenchman again to day Bob asked I m afraid so said Carl But it can t be helped and they ll soon find that there s nothing more to be had and go about their business It ll be better when we get those six hives home It was after nine o clock when they reached the ambushed hives and at the first glance Carl uttered a loud cry of dismay Why they re all shot to pieces They both ran up One hive was overturned with a great splintered hole blown through its side a second was nearly as bad and all the remaining four had been more or less perforated with buckshot Honey had run out on the ground and the bees were crawling about stupidly seeming too much disconcerted to gather it up Looks as if Larue had got his eyes open again said Carl as they surveyed the wreck Yes and he s on the warpath Bob lamented Just when I had planned to make peace with him I hoped he d never find out that we had engineered this riot and we ve paid him for his hens and I was going to send him some honey to sweeten him up And now it s all off Well I don t believe this is a particularly safe spot for us if he s out with his gun said Carl Let s get these hives moved away First Bob peeped through the thickets into the clearing A good many bees still hung about the barn and cabin and no doubt they were fiercely cross at finding no honey where they had expected it There was no sign of the French family very likely they were under their smudge again I can t say I blame Larue for being mad said Bob after being driven out of his house for two days running I suppose he expected to find all quiet this morning and it s almost as bad as ever Then he found these hives and he naturally bombarded them Well if he hadn t brought our honey down here it wouldn t have happened returned Carl hard heartedly He ll bombard us too if we hang around here long They carried the dilapidated hives down to the boat with a good deal of difficulty and rowed them up stream Two of them were ruined but it was likely that the bees themselves and the combs would do very well if lodged in fresh hives The outfit was nearly double its former weight and a later investigation showed that the bees had crammed every available cell with honey and had built fresh scraps of comb in any corner where there was room On their return Alice met them with a joyful face What do you think she cried I ve been sorting over the cases of sections you brought back and there are a lot that haven t been touched by the bees at all perhaps three or four hundred and there are quite a lot more that have only little torn places so they can go as No anyway Then there are all the sections that weren t stolen at all We ll still have some honey to sell Maybe a hundred dollars worth returned Carl That won t go far toward our big payment next week Yes it will with our extracted honey urged Bob We must get it all off extract every drop we have and sell it quick sacrifice it if necessary Anything to get returns at once There must be four hundred dollars worth on the hives We can make the payment if we re quick said Alice Anyway we won t have a cent left over insisted Carl who seemed determined to look on the black side But we have the bees Next year they ll make our fortunes said Alice cheerfully Tired as he was Bob paddled down to Morton that afternoon wrote a letter of explanation to Brown Son and ordered by telegraph nine hundred five pound honey pails to be shipped by return freight The pails cost forty dollars and he groaned inwardly as he parted with the money It was with some uneasiness that he navigated his boat past the squatter s clearing but he saw nothing of any of the Larue family either coming or going When he got back to the bee yard he found that Alice and Carl had been busy They had brought in the old honey extractor cleaned and oiled it and set it up along with the honey tanks Carl had improvised an uncapping box from the rain water barrel and they had already extracted the honey from a great number of the damaged and unfinished sections of comb The three of them finished up that part of the work during the afternoon and cleaned out all the honey from the unsaleable sections and from those that the bees had torn in Larue s barn From these they got more than a thousand pounds of fine clear honey It was an excellent beginning But it was only a beginning In five days they would have to pay Mr Farr five hundred dollars with interest To sell the honey might well take two days Consequently they had something more than two days in which to take off extract and pack a crop of perhaps four thousand pounds of honey It would have been a fairly large undertaking for skilled men and the Harmans were quite unaccustomed to extracting on a large scale But they had determination enough to make up for lack of experience They went to bed early in order to have as long a rest as possible By daylight Alice was preparing breakfast and the sun was not more than fairly above the trees when they attacked the big job Armed with veils gloves smokers and bee brushes the boys went out to the yard while Alice waited for the honey to come in The big extracting supers were full of bees that rushed up furiously when the cover was lifted off Carl drove them down with smoke while Bob quickly lifted out comb after comb shook and brushed off the bees in masses before the hive and put the combs into an empty super When that was full he carried it with some difficulty into the house While he was gone Carl removed the now vacant super closed the hive and smoked another Bob came back in a moment and cleared the bees from this super carrying it likewise into the cabin Super after super came off and when seven or eight of them were stacked in the honey room they began extracting operations Alice had volunteered to do the uncapping as she had been accustomed to do it at home and she had the huge razor edged honey knife already standing in a pail of hot water since the edge cuts much better when warm enough to melt the wax She rested one of the full honeycombs on the rim of the barrel and with a single sweep of the great knife she sliced off the entire outer sealed surface of the comb so as to leave the cells open Repeating this operation upon the other side she handed the comb to Carl who slipped it into the extractor When four combs had been uncapped and put into the machine he turned the crank vigorously The reel whirred as the combs spun round impelled by centrifugal force the honey flew out of the cells against the sides of the extractor and dribbled slowly down to the bottom When he stopped the machine to take out the now empty combs Carl put his finger down into the extractor and scraped up a dripping fingerful of honey which he put into his mouth Delicious he exclaimed with high appreciation Meanwhile Alice had uncapped a fresh set of four combs and a pool of honey was forming in the bottom of the extractor It was so thick that it ran very slowly down the sides but within a few minutes it stood several inches deep Bob drew off a pailful through the gate and poured it through the cheese cloth strainer into one of the tanks It was almost water clear thick and rich honey of the very highest grade Bob then returned to the hives and began to bring in supers single handed taking back the sets of emptied combs and replacing them on the hives He was able to attend to this duty as fast as Alice and Carl could uncap and extract At noon when Alice stopped work to prepare dinner they had extracted almost six hundred pounds of honey It was the harvest from fourteen hives Why that isn t half bad said Alice after making this calculation That amounts to about forty five pounds per hive Better than I expected from this poor season We may have more honey than we think said Carl brightening But we must get ahead faster or it ll take us all the week During the afternoon they managed to empty the supers of twenty one colonies But these were not quite so well filled and yielded only a little more than seven hundred pounds That night it rained the longed for rain now too late to be of service Early the next morning they set to work again but had to stop taking off honey on account of a fresh downpour In the midst of the rain the wagon arrived from Morton with the nine hundred honey pails Couldn t we send some of it back with him suggested Alice So they begged the teamster to wait a few hours and set to work furiously filling the tins from the tanks Bob sat by the tank with a mountain of five pound pails beside him filling them rapidly from the open honey gate Once full he passed them to Alice who wiped them clean and put on the covers then Carl nailed them up again in their shipping crates At noon they ate a hasty cold luncheon and again set feverishly to work at the pails They made such speed that at four o clock they were able to start the wagon back with a load of two hundred five pound pails of honey The rain had stopped and they began to take off honey and extract again They were getting rather tired and the task before them seemed endless It was the twenty ninth of the month It seemed hardly possible that they could put up all that honey and turn it into cash in less than three days All that afternoon they toiled weary and silent but still determined The uncapping barrel was nearly full of oozy masses of comb from which the honey drained slowly into a pail through a hole in the bottom The three Harmans were smeared to the eyes with honey They were stiff with stings too for the whole room was crawling with bees that had been brought in on the combs They were underfoot on the walls in the cappings and the strainer and a great mass had clustered on the window like a swarm By six o clock there were scarcely half a dozen hives left uncleared in the apiary though a large pile of unhandled supers had accumulated in the workroom They stopped work and the boys helped Alice to get supper But we re not going to get through in time said Bob anxiously It ll take us nearly all of to morrow to extract and can up the rest of the honey Then it ll take some time to get it sold But we ve got to get through in time cried Alice Are we going to fail now by just a few hours Well let s finish the extracting to night work till it s done Bob proposed All right replied Carl wearily I m game So after supper they attacked their task afresh The boys tried to get all the supers into the house while daylight lasted They worked hard but the last supers were very heavy the bees were cross as night came on and darkness had fallen before they got the last one in Alice placed several beeswax candles about the room and they began to extract Hour after hour the whir and rattle of the extractor went on It was almost the only sound in the room for they were too tired to talk The pile of full supers went down and the empty ones went up till they clogged the room and had to be carried outdoors Alice uncapped till she could no longer hold the slippery knife handle and Carl took her place while she drew off honey from the extractor into the tanks It was hot in the choked little room reeking with the odor of honey and the smell of the candles and the tankful of wet cappings and occasionally they went outdoors for a few minutes to cool off and breathe a little Alice said that bee keeping was kid glove work nothing heavy or hard about it remarked Carl ironically during one of these rests It seemed to be tacitly understood that they were to keep at it till the honey was all extracted and they stayed doggedly at work despite weariness and stings It was shortly after one o clock when they emptied the last super they were all saturated with honey and perspiration the uncapping tank was heaped with wax and the candles had burned low All the tanks were brimful and there was over a hundred pounds in the reservoir of the extractor Going to can it up asked Carl faintly Not much Bob ejaculated I m going to bed They were all ready to go Alice retired to her room and the boys spread blankets on the floor of the living room They were tired enough to doze the moment their heads touched the pillow but Bob had not been in bed for five minutes when he bounced up with a yell A bee had stung him on the leg The floor and the blankets were alive with bees Bees seemed to be everywhere The boys shook out their bedding swept up the floor and tried again There were fewer bees now but still enough to make their presence felt and finally the boys became nervous and wakeful imagining that they felt crawling bees even where there were none After a restless half hour Bob got up and lighted a candle I can t sleep I m going to can up honey he announced Carl wearily followed him and after they had been at work a few minutes Alice came out and joined them There had not been so many bees in her room but more than enough to make sleeping impossible Hour after hour they drew off honey from the big tanks into the little pails and packed them in the crates They worked till after three o clock stopped for hot coffee and bread and completed their great task soon after sunrise There were altogether five pound tins beside the two hundred already sent to Morton a total crop of pounds At least fifty pounds more would still drain from the uncapping tank But they were too dead weary to rejoice They ate a hastily prepared breakfast then carried the blankets to a sunny spot outdoors and went sound asleep Not one of them woke till nearly noon when they were aroused by the hallooing of the teamster who had been ordered to come back that day for another load It made a big load and the man was unwilling to take it But they could not think of another day s wait and finally persuaded him with arguments and increased pay Bob was to go out with the load they had agreed He was to ship the honey and go to Toronto with it There he was to make the quickest possible sale and send the money back by telegraph You d better come over to Morton on the first of August day after to morrow he said to Carl as he was leaving Probably you ll find the money waiting for you at the telegraph office If it isn t there wait at the hotel and I ll telephone you some time during the day In case there s any delay get old Farr to let us have a few days grace He ought to do that especially if we pay him for the accommodation Bob went off on the loaded wagon Carl and Alice were too thoroughly tired to feel inclined to clear up the sticky litter in the extracting room and they spent most of the day in sleep Next morning however they put things in order The tank of wet cappings was left to drain still longer but Alice washed down the floor removed the extracting outfit and restored the boys bed All the live bees in the room were by this time clustered in a quiet lump on the window and Carl was able to brush them off gently into a bucket and carry them out to a hive like a natural swarm He put most of the wet supers back on the hives whence they had been taken and was surprised to notice that the bees paid no attention to these fresh sticky combs when they were exposed in the yard A little honey seemed to be coming in He could not guess its source but it was enough to keep the bees from robbing All this did not take them more than a couple of hours and Alice had even time to wash dry and iron a blouse before starting for the village which represented civilization for them just then Carl also paid civilization the homage of brushing his shoes and putting on a tie under his low collar and then they made an early start down the river They rather disliked to leave the cabin unguarded but this time it contained little of value As they passed Indian Slough they spied Larue on the shore he looked long and steadily after them but neither made any sign Don t like it remarked Carl He knows we ve gone away now and goodness knows what he may do to the bees I don t think he ll touch them He must have had enough of fighting bees returned Alice Anyhow it was a chance that had to be taken for they could not stand on guard by the apiary forever They reached Morton about ten o clock and went straight to the telegraph office where they were bitterly disappointed to find no waiting message from Bob A feeling of impending misfortune crept over both of them They had fully expected the money to be there I do hope Bob doesn t try one of his wild bluffs for a high price and miss a sale altogether Carl muttered Alice went to the hotel to be on the lookout for a telephone call while Carl hung about the telegraph office At every clicking of the keys he thrilled with anticipation but noon arrived and one o clock and still no word from Toronto Carl then hunted up Mr Farr and explained the situation I don t know why Bob hasn t wired he said but we ve got the honey and it s as safe as money in the bank It s only a matter of a few hours or days at the most If you ll give us a little extension of time we ll gladly pay you for it Anything you wish five dollars or ten dollars a day even But the postmaster shook his head with a grim smile I ll give you all the time the law allows and not an hour longer he said Yes but can t you No I can t I told you out and out at the start that you d get no kindness from me straight business and nothing further He refused to hear a word of Carl s protestations and at last the boy went to the hotel indignant and keenly anxious Alice had had no message They waited staying near the telephone unable to read unable to talk till about four o clock a call came for Carl Almost breathless he took the receiver and recognized Bob s long distance voice Is that you Bob he cried What have you done Farr won t give us an hour s time Never mind came his brother s reassuring voice It s all right I sold at ten and a half I ve got the money and I ll wire it at once Ten and a half They had not expected to get over ten cents for the extracted honey Carl almost shouted and Alice gasped with relief when he told her It seemed as if a mountain s weight had been lifted off their shoulders But there must have been some delay about sending the money for it had not arrived by six o clock Carl hung about the telegraph office all the evening growing uneasy once more as hour by hour went by Surely something had not gone wrong at the last minute But the money bearing message did finally arrive towards ten o clock It was an order for which included the returns from what was left of their comb honey crop The telegraph clerk wrote a check and Carl and his sister hastened to Farr s house It was dark from top to bottom Carl knocked loudly once twice There was
