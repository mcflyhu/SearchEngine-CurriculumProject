Martin Wittenhaagen standing at the foot of the stairs with his arrow drawn nearly to the head and his knife behind him was struck with amazement to see the men come back without Gerard he lowered his bow and looked open mouthed at them They for their part were equally puzzled at the attitude they had caught him in Why mates was the old fellow making ready to shoot at us Stuff said Martin recovering his stolid composure I was but trying my new string There I ll unstring my bow if you think that Humph said Dierich suspiciously there is something more in you than I understand put a log on and let us dry our hides a bit ere we go A blazing fire was soon made and the men gathered round it and their clothes and long hair were soon smoking from the cheerful blaze Then it was that the shrieks were heard in Margaret s room They all started up and one of them seized the candle and ran up the steps that led to the bedrooms Martin rose hastily too and being confused by these sudden screams and apprehending danger from the man s curiosity tried to prevent him from going there At this Dierich threw his arms round him from behind and called on the others to keep him The man that had the candle got clear away and all the rest fell upon Martin and after a long and fierce struggle in the course of which they were more than once all rolling on the floor with Martin in the middle they succeeded in mastering the old Samson and binding him hand and foot with a rope they had brought for Gerard Martin groaned aloud He saw the man had made his way to Margaret s room during the struggle and here was he powerless Ay grind your teeth you old rogue said Dierich panting with the struggle You shan t use them It is my belief mates that our lives were scarce safe while this old fellow s bones were free He makes me think this Gerard is not far off put in another No such luck replied Dierich Hallo mates Jorian Ketel is a long time in that girl s bedroom Best go and see after him some of us The rude laugh caused by this remark had hardly subsided when hasty footsteps were heard running along over head Oh here he comes at last Well Jorian what is to do now up there standing n adj After the earthquake only a few houses were left standing They re standing out against any change in the law drawn v adj All the characters in the story are drawn from life Her gaze was drawn irresistibly to the scene outside amazement n All those around him looked at him with amazement He looked at me in blank amazement stolid adj Her face showed nothing but stolid indifference He conceals his feelings behind a rather stolid manner shrieks n shriek v shriek shrieks of fiendish laughter For years from newspapers broadcasts the stages and at meetings we had heard nothing but grandiloquent rhetoric delivered with shouts and shrieks that deafened the ears apprehending apprehend China has not been totally unsuccessful apprehending corruption suspects Apprehending violence is not an easy task binding The contract was not signed and has no binding force Both sides have agreed that the arbitration will be binding groaned v groan He groaned in anguish The cart groaned under the weight of the piano subsided v subside After the heavy rains part of the road subsided By evening the storm had subsided and all was quiet again
