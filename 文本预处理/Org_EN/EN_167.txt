The talk was fitful in the living room Elizabeth Cornish did her best to revive the happiness of her guests but she herself was a prey to the same subdued excitement which showed in the faces of the others A restraint had been taken away by the disappearance of both the storm centers of the dinner the sheriff and Terry Therefore it was possible to talk freely And people talked But not loudly They were prone to gather in little familiar groups and discuss in a whisper how Terry had risen and spoken before them Now and then someone for the sake of politeness strove to open a general theme of conversation but it died away like a ripple on a placid pond But what I can t understand said Elizabeth to Vance when she was able to maneuver him to her side later on is why they seem to expect something more Vance was very grave and looked tired The realization that all his cunning all his work had been for nothing tormented him He had set his trap and baited it and it had worked perfectly save that the teeth of the trap had closed over thin air At the denouement of the sheriff s story there should have been the barking of two guns and a film of gunpowder smoke should have gone tangling to the ceiling Instead there had been the formal little speech from Terry and then quiet Yet he had to mask and control his bitterness he had to watch his tongue in talking with his sister You see he said quietly they don t understand They can t see how fine Terry is in having made no attempt to avenge the death of his father I suppose a few of them think he s a coward I even heard a little talk to that effect Impossible cried Elizabeth She had not thought of this phase of the matter All at once she hated the sheriff It really is possible said Vance You see it s known that Terry never fights if he can avoid it There never has been any real reason for fighting until today But you know how gossip will put the most unrelated facts together and make a complete story in some way I wish the sheriff were dead moaned Elizabeth Oh Vance if you only hadn t gone near Craterville If you only hadn t distributed those wholesale invitations It was almost too much for Vance to be reproached after so much of the triumph was on her side such a complete victory that she herself would never dream of the peril she and Terry had escaped But he had to control his irritation In fact he saw his whole life ahead of him carefully schooled and controlled He no longer had anything to sell Elizabeth had made a mock of him and shown him that he was hollow that he was living on her charity He must all the days that she remained alive keep flattering her trying to find a way to make himself a necessity to her And after her death there would be a still harder task Terry who disliked him pointedly would then be the master and he would face the bitter necessity of cajoling the youngster whom he detested A fine life truly An almost noble anguish of the spirit came upon Vance He was urged to the very brink of the determination to thrust out into the world and make his own living But he recoiled from that horrible idea in time Yes he said that was the worst step I ever took But I was trying to be wholehearted in the Western way my dear and show that I had entered into the spirit of things As a matter of fact sighed Elizabeth you nearly ruined Terry s life and mine Very near said the penitent Vance But then you see how well it has turned out Terry has taken the acid test and now you can trust him under any The words were literally blown off ragged at his lips Two revolver shots exploded at them No one gun could have fired them And there was a terrible significance in the angry speed with which one had followed the other blending so that the echo from the lofty side of Sleep Mountain was but a single booming sound In that clear air it was impossible to tell the direction of the noise Everyone in the room seemed to listen stupidly for a repetition of the noises But there was no repetition Vance whispered Elizabeth in such a tone that the coward dared not look into her face It s happened What He knew but he wanted the joy of hearing it from her own lips It has happened she whispered in the same ghostly voice But which one That was it Who had fallen Terry or the sheriff A long heavy step crossed the little porch Either man might walk like that The door was flung open Terence Hollis stood before them I think that I ve killed the sheriff he said simply I m going up to my room to put some things together and I ll go into town with any man who wishes to arrest me Decide that between yourselves With that he turned and walked away with a step as deliberately unhurried as his approach had been The manner of the boy was more terrible than the thing he had done Twice he had shocked them on the same afternoon And they were just beginning to realize that the shell of boyhood was being ripped away from Terence Colby Terry Hollis son of Black Jack was being revealed to them The men received the news with utter bewilderment The sheriff was as formidable in the opinion of the mountains as some Achilles It was incredible that he should have fallen And naturally a stern murmur rose Foul play Since the first vigilante days there has been no sound in all the West so dreaded as that deep throated murmur of angry honest men That murmur from half a dozen law abiding citizens will put the fear of death in the hearts of a hundred outlaws The rumble grew spread Foul play And they began to look to one another these men of action Only Elizabeth was silent She rose to her feet as tall as her brother without an emotion on her face And her brother would never forget her It seems that you ve won Vance It seems that blood will out after all The time is not quite up and you win the bet Vance shook his head as though in protest and struck his hand across his face He dared not let her see the joy that contorted his features Triumph here on the very verge of defeat It misted his eyes Joy gave wings to his thoughts He was the master of the valley But you ll think before you do anything Elizabeth I ve done my thinking already twenty four years of it I m going to do what I promised I d do And that You ll see and hear in time What s yonder The men were rising one after another and bunching together Before Vance could answer there was a confusion in the hall running feet here and there They heard the hard shrill voice of Wu Chi chattering directions and the guttural murmurs of his fellow servants as they answered Someone ran out into the hall and came back to the huddling stirring crowd in the living room He s not dead but close to it Maybe die any minute maybe live through it That was the report We ll get young Hollis and hold him to see how the sheriff comes out Aye we ll get him All at once they boiled into action and the little crowd of men thrust for the big doors that led into the hall They cast the doors back and came directly upon the tall white headed figure of Gainor CHAPTER Gainor s dignity split the force of their rush They recoiled as water strikes on a rock and divides into two meager swirls And when one or two went past him on either side he recalled them Boys there seems to be a little game on hand What is it Something repelling coldly inquiring in his attitude and in his voice They would have gone on if they could but they could not He held them with a force of knowledge of things that they did not know They were remembering that this man had gone out with the sheriff to meet apparently his death And yet Gainor a well tried friend of the sheriff seemed unexcited They had to answer his question and how could they lie when he saw them rushing through a door with revolvers coming to brown skillful hands It was someone from the rear who made the confession We re going to get young Black Jack That was it The speech came out like the crack of a gun clearing the atmosphere It told every man exactly what was in his own mind felt but not confessed They had no grudge against Terry really But they were determined to hang the son of Black Jack Had it been a lesser deed they might have let him go But his victim was too distinguished in their society He had struck down Joe Minter the ghost of the great Black Jack himself seemed to have stalked out among them You re going to get young Terry Hollis interpreted Gainor and his voice rose and rang over them Those who had slipped past him on either side came back and faced him In the distance Elizabeth had not stirred Vance kept watching her face It was cold as ice unreadable He could not believe that she was allowing this lynching party to organize under her own roof a lynching party aimed at Terence It began to grow in him that he had gained a greater victory than he imagined If you aim at Terry went on Gainor his voice even louder you ll have to aim at me too There s going to be no lynching bee my friends The women had crowded back in the room They made a little bank of stir and murmur around Elizabeth Gentlemen said Gainor shaking his white hair back again in his imposing way there has been no murder The sheriff is not going to die There has been a disagreement between two men of honor The sheriff is now badly wounded I think that is all Does anybody want to ask questions about what has happened There was a bustle in the group of men They were putting away the weapons not quite sure what they could do next I am going to tell you exactly what has happened said Gainor You heard the unfortunate things that passed at the table today What the sheriff said was not said as an insult but under the circumstances it became necessary for Terence Hollis to resent what he had heard As a man of honor he could not do otherwise You all agree with me in that They grunted a grudging assent There were ways and ways of looking at such things The way of Gainor was a generation old But there was something so imposing about the old fellow something which breathed the very spirit of honor and fair play that they could not argue the point Accordingly Mr Hollis sent for the sheriff Not to bring him outdoors and shoot him down in a sudden gunplay nor to take advantage of him through a surprise as a good many men would have been tempted to do my friends for the sheriff has a wide reputation as a handler of guns of all sorts No sir he sent for me also and he told us frankly that the bad blood between him and the sheriff must be spent You understand By the Lord my friends I admired the fine spirit of the lad He expected to be shot rather than to drop the sheriff I could tell that by his expression But his eye did not falter It carried me back to the old days to old days sirs There was not a murmur in the entire room The eye of Elizabeth Cornish was fire Whether with anger or pride Vance could not tell But he began to worry We went over to the group of silver spruce near the house I gave them the directions They came and stood together back to back with their revolvers not drawn They began to walk away in opposite directions at my command When I called Turn they wheeled My gun was ready to shoot down the first man guilty of foul play but there was no attempt to turn too soon before the signal They whirled snatching out their guns and the revolver of the sheriff hung in his clothes A groan from the little crowd Although upon my word said Gainor I do not think that the sheriff could have possibly brought out his gun as swiftly as Terence Hollis did His whirl was like the spin of a top or the snap of a whiplash and as he snapped about the revolver was in his hand not raised to draw a bead but at his hip The sheriff set his teeth but Terry did not fire A bewildered murmur from the crowd No my friends cried Gainor his voice quivering he did not fire He dropped the muzzle of his gun and waited By heaven my heart went out to him It was magnificent The thin strong hand of Elizabeth closed on the arm of Vance That was a Colby who did that she whispered The sheriff gritted his teeth went on Gainor and tore out his gun All this pause had been such a space as is needed for an eyelash to flicker twice Out shot the sheriff s Colt And then and not until then did the muzzle of Terry s revolver jerk up Even after that delay he beat the sheriff to the trigger The two shots came almost together but the sheriff was already falling when he pulled his trigger and his aim was wild He dropped on one side the revolver flying out of his hand I started forward and then I stopped By heaven the sheriff had stretched out his arm and picked up his gun again He was not through fighting A bulldog spirit you say Yes And what could I do It was the sheriff s right to keep on fighting as long as he wished And it was the right of Terence to shoot the man full of holes the minute his hand touched the revolver again I could only stand still I saw the sheriff raise his revolver It was an effort of agony But he was still trying to kill And I nerved myself and waited for the explosion of the gun of Terence I say I nerved myself for that shock but the gun did not explode I looked at him in wonder My friends he was putting up his gun and quietly looking the sheriff in the eye At that I shouted to him I don t know what I shouted to the sheriff not to fire Too late The muzzle of the gun was already tilting up the barrel was straightening And then the gun fell from Minter s hand and he dropped on his side His strength had failed him at the last moment But I say sirs that what Terence Hollis did was the finest thing I have ever seen in my life and I have seen fine things done by gentlemen before There may be unpleasant associations with the name of Terry s father I for one shall never carry over those associations to the son Never He has my hand my respect my esteem in every detail He is a gentleman my friends There is nothing for us to do If the sheriff is unfortunate and the wound should prove fatal Terence will give himself up to the law If he lives he will be the first to tell you to keep your hands off the boy He ended in a little silence But there was no appreciative burst of applause from those who heard him The fine courage of Terence was to them merely the iron nerve of the man killer the keen eye and the judicious mind which knew that the sheriff would collapse before he fired his second shot And his courtesy before the first shot was simply the surety of the man who knew that no matter what advantage he gave to his enemy his own speed of hand would more than make up for it Gainor reading their minds paid no more heed to them He went straight across the room and took the hand of Elizabeth Dear Miss Cornish he said so that all could hear I congratulate you for the man you have given us in Terence Hollis Vance watching saw the tears of pleasure brighten the eyes of his sister You are very kind she said But now I must see Sheriff Minter and be sure that everything is done for him It seemed that the party took this as a signal for dismissal As she went across the room there were a dozen hasty adieus and soon the guests were streaming towards the doors Vance and Elizabeth and Gainor went to the sheriff He had been installed in a guest room His eyes were closed his arms outstretched A thick telltale bandage was wrapped about his breast And Wu Chi skillful in such matters from a long experience was sliding about the room in his whispering slippers The sheriff did not open his eyes when Elizabeth tried his pulse It was faint but steady He had been shot through the body and the lungs grazed for as he breathed there was a faint bubble of blood that grew and swelled and burst on his lips at every breath But he lived and he would live unless there were an unnecessary change for the worse They went softly out of the room again Elizabeth was grave Mr Gainor took her hand I think I know what people are saying now and what they will say hereafter If Terry s father were any other than Hollis this affair would soon he forgotten except as a credit to him But even as it is he will live this matter down I want to tell you again Miss Cornish that you have reason to be proud of him He is the sort of man I should be proud to have in my own family Madam good by And if there is anything in which I can be of service to you or to Terence call on me at any time and to any extent And he went down the hall with a little swagger Mr Gainor felt that he had risen admirably to a great situation As a matter of fact he had Elizabeth
