Minutes seemed to go by Vague hints from servants things I had read in the papers and still I sat there not moving by so much as a hair He was looking at me now and telling me to keep cool And then I suppose you know there are such places He interrupted himself to say Remember A careless look or move would mean well it would mean ruin Now do you understand Beyond a doubt I did If I moved or cried for help he would kill me before my aunt could get back before I could cross the room Though why he should wish to kill me I could form no idea You must have time to recover he said in that muted uneven voice I will shield you while you pull yourself together He had bent forward till his shoulders shut out my view of the group at the other end of the room I shrank further back into the cushions But [Pg ] I have myself in hand now I said for I remembered you must never let the insane know you are afraid Betty s laughter sounded far away Take your time he said They re enjoying themselves They haven t even rung for the cognac and liqueurs yet They would make Bettina and me drink a liqueur he said Or if they failed in that they d say a thimble full of coffee then And our coffee would be doctored But we ve had coffee I said in a new access of terror Was it drugged coffee that made me feel so lamed That was all right he said That was to steady us He did not look as if he needed steadying What if he were not mad Be careful he said again Remember I am running a ghastly risk in telling you But you are facing a ghastly certainty if I don t I sat in that stillness of stark terror staring at him And as I stared I found myself clinging to the thought that had been horror s height a little[Pg ] while before Pray God he s mad I kept saying inwardly If I could keep my head he said I had no cause to be so frightened It would be some little time before he could give me up without rousing suspicion Before you give me up I imagined the Grey Hawk swooping to snatch me Before I help you to get out of this he explained And when I do you will perhaps remember it is at a sacrifice Greater than I supposed I could feel I moved at that but like a sleep walker on the edge of waking I asked him in a whisper what we were to do I meant Betty and me But he said When she begins to play or to sing you are to get up quite quietly can you I made a sign for yes No haste you must do it languidly go out of the room But my I suppressed my aunt with an inward twist of questioning anguish shall I not be asked where I am going and why He said no Because he would make the others[Pg ] a sign He thought my sister was too excited to take any notice of my going But if she does I ll tell her you wanted her to go on singing I shall seem to be coming after you But I ll stop to explain that we ve had an argument about one of the pictures in the hall He told me what I was to do If after all they were to prevent me what what then They won t they will leave you to me He said it with a look that stopped the heart I implored him to let me go out alone He fixed his unhappy eyes on mine You would never be allowed out of this room alone I could say I must post a letter They would ring for a servant I measured the long room If once I got as far as the door I could run as far as the front door perhaps You would find it locked No servant would open it for you Will they for you I can do it for you he said under his breath and he stood up I thought he meant I was to make trial then[Pg ] of that terrible passage to the door But was it not better to be where Betty was whatever came Betty and I together than Betty alone with those devouring eyed men and I with a maniac out in the hall I cannot leave my sister I said He stood in front of me masking me from the others Haven t I made you understand If you don t leave the room with me she will leave it with Whitby Dawson No No He hushed me She won t know why but she ll do it And she won t come back again She would probably be on her way to Paris this time to morrow He pulled a great cushion up to hide my face And then he turned and made a feint of getting an illustrated paper off the table He kept his eye on the others There was some little commotion during which Betty had risen She left the sofa and sat on the piano stool She was laughing excitedly The man came back to me with the illustrated paper He sat down closer to me and held the paper open for a shield But he held it strangely with his arm across the picture The reading part[Pg ] was in French I had to crane to see over the top Betty twisting round on the piano stool and touching the keys in a provoking way the two men teasing her to sing I have lived over every instant of that hour until the smallest detail is a stain indelible upon my mind I have no trouble in remembering My trouble is to be able to forget I hear again that muted voice behind the paper saying But for the collie dog story I wouldn t have dared to risk this Everything depends on your nerve And then he looked at me curiously and wanted to know if I had not heard there were such places I won t say like this This is a masterpiece of devilry And masterpieces are never plentiful He waited for me to say something If I had known what I could not have said it I tried hard to speak But I could only look dumbly in his face And I saw there was no madness in the unhappy eyes You must have heard or read of places where men and women meet he insisted Then with an immense effort I managed to say that I didn t seem able to think I had been[Pg ] imagining other people insane But perhaps it was I I stared over the top of the French paper that he was both holding up and hiding from me I thought to myself My mind is going I must have said as much for he answered quickly Not a bit of it You ve had a shock that s all I did not realise it at the time but looking back I seem to see the man s growing horror of my horror and his fear I should betray him I am sorry I told you he said What was it he had told me I asked him to help me to understand You make it hard That isn t fair he said You give me a sense of violation You implicate me in spite of the quixotic resolve I made when you begged me not to go You make me after all an instrument of initiation Yes he complained Yet looking back from the bleak height of later knowledge I think he betrayed some relish of the moment Heaven forgive me if I do him wrong But he was not I think losing all that he had come for or he would have shortened my agony He was conscious [Pg ] I think of the excitement of finding himself intellectually on virgin ground True he was sacrificing what few of his sort would sacrifice And he was running the gravest personal risk for at some point I asked about that If she knew what you had told me what would she do Call in her bullies to beat me to a jelly He was more and more unwilling to seem a mere adjunct of the baseness he unveiled I was not to judge too harshly This situation he nodded towards Bettina the old man and the young one all this far more crudely managed is a commonplace in the world in every capital of every nation on the earth And it has always been so He saw I did not believe him He seemed to imagine that while I was being torn on the rack where he had stretched me I could think of other things I cried to him under my breath not to torture me any more help me quickly to get help He said I must trust him Everything depended on choosing the right moment If you went out now with that face you d pull the house about our ears [Pg ] He was doing all he could to calm and steady me he said And certainly he tried to make me feel that what to me was like a maniac s nightmare an abysmal horror beggaring language and crucifying thought it was all a commonplace to men and women of the world Human nature Human nature like the tolling of a muffled bell Bishops and old ladies imagined you could alter these things Take India I ve been there I knew an official who d had charge of the chaklas You don t know what chaklas are Your father knew If you d gone riding round any one of the cantonments you d have seen Little groups of tents A hospital not far off Women in the tents Out there it s no secret They re called Government women The women are needed by the army So there they are Women are needed Through the chaos came back clear the memory of my talk with Betty in the train Men don t need us as much as we need them Even Governments he said had to recognise human nature and shape their policies accordingly I was too young to remember all that talk[Pg ] in the press some years ago about the mysterious movements of British battleships in the Mediterranean Instead of hanging about Malta the ships had gone cruising round the Irish coast Why The officials said for good and sufficient reasons The chorus of criticism died down The reasons were known to those who had to know Not enough women at Malta The British fleet spent some time about the Irish coasts Human nature I can do it now I cried under my breath and I stood up He shot out a hand and pulled me back Christ not while the grey hawk is hovering outside And your lips are livid A good thing he said that I had still a few minutes You have your sister to thank She is a success She piles up anticipation The value of that to the jaded is the stock in trade of people like our hostess At a time when her profession is a hundred per cent more dangerous than it s ever been since the world began she perfects it makes it pay in proportion to its danger Couldn t I trust him to know He gave me his word No indecent haste here They are adepts They have[Pg ] learned that the climax is less to the sated than the leading up The leading up is all After a second How did she get hold of you I knew no more than the dead Through someone very well informed He probed and questioned I could only shake my head But my tortured mind flung itself spasmodically from one figure to another in our little world and felt each one s recoil from my mere unspoken thought Until the little dressmaker Her questions her pains to establish the fact of our isolation of our poverty her special interest in our aunt You haf a photografie hein And then the picture s vanishing Had it come to this house to serve as model The Tartar liked the new coiffure Two servants came in One carried a great silver tray Oh leave that a bit The Tartar over the back of the sofa waved the footman off They came towards us and were told Put it there on the table The man beside me made a show of welcoming it He dropped the illustrated[Pg ] paper on my lap Bend down bend down low he whispered I bent over the swimming page What will you have he called out to me as the footmen were leaving the room I tried to answer No sound Oh you prefer cr me de menthe do you he said quite loud Yes there s cr me de menthe He filled a glass and brought it to me Cognac he whispered It will steady you I put my shaking lips to the glass I did not drink Ah you are afraid he said And he looked at me with his unhappy eyes My hand was shaking Some of the stuff spilt out on my new dress Give it to me he said and he drank it off just to show me I was conscious that Betty was singing And that the door had opened The Grey Hawk stood there with as I thought at first a thick set boy dressed in a man s evening clothes As she dismissed him I saw he was a hunchback She shut the door behind the hunchback and the Colonel left the piano and came towards her [Pg ] He was laughing They stood and talked Bend down Bend low the voice said in my ear The Colonel s croaking laugh came nearer The man at my side called out Look here Colonel No poaching on my preserves We are deep in a discussion about Art You re not to interrupt Oh Art is it The old man had come behind our sofa and was leaning down between us I smelt a foul breath With a sense of choking I lifted my head The Colonel s watery eyes went from me to the strange ugly picture in the illustrated paper I did not understand it I do not think I would have been conscious of having looked at it but for the expression on the Colonel s face Bettina finished her song They all clapped In the buzz Bettina raised her voice No no She couldn t dance and sing as well as accompany herself she said What time is it in the grey woman asked She took Bettina s place at the piano Still Bettina hesitated while The Tartar urged [Pg ] Oh I don t mind Bettina said if you like such babyish songs Of course we do the Colonel went back to them Bettina said pertly I should think you d be ashamed She stood beside the grey woman and hummed the old tune She helped by striking a few notes Now the grey woman said to Betty The word was echoed in my ear Now I repeated But first he caught my hand Bite your lip a little Ah not blood He smuggled his handkerchief to me behind the cushion You ll be all right he whispered But I wish I could go with you You see that I must stay behind Yes oh yes I looked at Betty I must stay he said to give you time Then when I ve seen you out of this a door open a door shut and I shall never see you again Now Now I hardly noticed that he took his blood stained handkerchief out of my hand For Bettina had come forward and stood poised [Pg ] holding her green skirt with both hands like a child about to curtsey I stood up All the room was dancing with my little sister I got to the door Where are you going to Betty sang But she was too amused and excited to notice me My companion had crossed the room and was bending over the Grey Hawk She looked round at him surprised mocking Some power came to help me across the threshold A footman started up out of the floor and stood before me Where are you going He echoed Betty I am waiting for one of the gentlemen I said and I steadied myself against a chair If Betty s song stopped I should know we had failed I held my breath as I leaned over and took my last look into the room Our friend was leaving the grey woman She played on Bettina was dancing a hand on her hip the other twirling moustachios playing the gallant Such a baby she looked And I had done her hair like that [Pg ] What is your fortune my pretty maid The man had come out and softly shut the door He gave the footman a strange look and passed him something It s all right he said The footman looked in his hand and stared Mais merci merci monsieur He vanished I went towards the stairs That s not the way the voice said harshly Shan t I get a cloak For God s sake no It s a
