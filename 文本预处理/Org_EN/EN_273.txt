Jacob Welse was given due respect when he arose at the convening of the miners meeting and denounced the proceedings While such meetings had performed a legitimate function in the past he contended when there was no law in the land that time was now beyond recall for law was now established and it was just law The Queen s government had shown itself fit to cope with the situation and for them to usurp its powers was to step backward into the night out of which they had come Further no lighter word than criminal could characterize such conduct And yet further he promised them in set sober terms if anything serious were the outcome to take an active part in the prosecution of every one of them At the conclusion of his speech he made a motion to hold the prisoner for the territorial court and to adjourn but was voted down without discussion Don t you see St Vincent said to Frona there is no hope But there is Listen And she swiftly outlined the plot of the night before He followed her in a half hearted way too crushed to partake of her enthusiasm It s madness to attempt it he objected when she had done And it looks very much like hanging not to attempt it she answered a little spiritedly Surely you will make a fight Surely he replied hollowly The first witnesses were two Swedes who told of the wash tub incident when Borg had given way to one of his fits of anger Trivial as the incident was in the light of subsequent events it at once became serious It opened the way for the imagination into a vast familiar field It was not so much what was said as what was left unsaid Men born of women the rudest of them knew life well enough to be aware of its significance a vulgar common happening capable of but one interpretation Heads were wagged knowingly in the course of the testimony and whispered comments went the rounds Half a dozen witnesses followed in rapid succession all of whom had closely examined the scene of the crime and gone over the island carefully and all of whom were agreed that there was not the slightest trace to be found of the two men mentioned by the prisoner in his preliminary statement To Frona s surprise Del Bishop went upon the stand She knew he disliked St Vincent but could not imagine any evidence he could possess which would bear upon the case Being sworn and age and nationality ascertained Bill Brown asked him his business Pocket miner he challenged back sweeping the assemblage with an aggressive glance Now it happens that a very small class of men follow pocketing and that a very large class of men miners too disbelieve utterly in any such method or obtaining gold Pocket miner sneered a red shirted patriarchal looking man a man who had washed his first pan in the Californian diggings in the early fifties Yep Del affirmed Now look here young feller his interlocutor continued d ye mean to tell me you ever struck it in such fangled way Yep Don t believe it with a contemptuous shrug Del swallowed fast and raised his head with a jerk Mr Chairman I rise to make a statement I won t interfere with the dignity of the court but I just wish to simply and distinctly state that after the meeting s over I m going to punch the head of every man that gets gay Understand You re out of order the chairman replied rapping the table with the caulking mallet And your head too Del cried turning upon him Damn poor order you preserve Pocketing s got nothing to do with this here trial and why don t you shut such fool questions out I ll take care of you afterwards you potwolloper You will will you The chairman grew red in the face dropped the mallet and sprang to his feet Del stepped forward to meet him but Bill Brown sprang in between and held them apart Order gentlemen order he begged This is no time for unseemly exhibitions And remember there are ladies present The two men grunted and subsided and Bill Brown asked Mr Bishop we understand that you are well acquainted with the prisoner Will you please tell the court what you know of his general character Del broadened into a smile Well in the first place he s an extremely quarrelsome disposition Hold I won t have it The prisoner was on his feet trembling with anger You shall not swear my life away in such fashion To bring a madman whom I have only met once in my life to testify as to my character The pocket miner turned to him So you don t know me eh Gregory St Vincent No St Vincent replied coldly I do not know you my man Don t you man me Del shouted hotly But St Vincent ignored him turning to the crowd I never saw the fellow but once before and then for a few brief moments in Dawson You ll remember before I m done Del sneered so hold your hush and let me say my little say I come into the country with him way back in St Vincent regarded him with sudden interest Yep Mr Gregory St Vincent I see you begin to recollect I sported whiskers and my name was Brown Joe Brown in them days He grinned vindictively and the correspondent seemed to lose all interest Is it true Gregory Frona whispered I begin to recognize he muttered slowly I don t know no folly The man must have died You say in Mr Bishop Bill Brown prompted Yep in He was a newspaper man bound round the world by way of Alaska and Siberia I d run away from a whaler at Sitka that squares it with Brown and I engaged with him for forty a month and found Well he quarrelled with me A snicker beginning from nowhere in particular but passing on from man to man and swelling in volume greeted this statement Even Frona and Del himself were forced to smile and the only sober face was the prisoner s But he quarrelled with Old Andy at Dyea and with Chief George of the Chilcoots and the Factor at Pelly and so on down the line He got us into no end of trouble and specially woman trouble He was always monkeying around Mr Chairman I object Frona stood up her face quite calm and blood under control There is no necessity for bringing in the amours of Mr St Vincent They have no bearing whatsoever upon the case and further none of the men of this meeting are clean enough to be prompted by the right motive in conducting such an inquiry So I demand that the prosecution at least confine itself to relevant testimony Bill Brown came up smugly complacent and smiling Mr Chairman we willingly accede to the request made by the defence Whatever we have brought out has been relevant and material Whatever we intend to bring out shall be relevant and material Mr Bishop is our star witness and his testimony is to the point It must be taken into consideration that we nave no direct evidence as to the murder of John Borg We can bring no eye witnesses into court Whatever we have is circumstantial It is incumbent upon us to show cause To show cause it is necessary to go into the character of the accused This we intend to do We intend to show his adulterous and lustful nature which has culminated in a dastardly deed and jeopardized his neck We intend to show that the truth is not in him that he is a liar beyond price that no word he may speak upon the stand need be accepted by a jury of his peers We intend to show all this and to weave it together thread by thread till we have a rope long enough and strong enough to hang him with before the day is done So I respectfully submit Mr Chairman that the witness be allowed to proceed The chairman decided against Frona and her appeal to the meeting was voted down Bill Brown nodded to Del to resume As I was saying he got us into no end of trouble Now I ve been mixed up with water all my life never can get away from it it seems and the more I m mixed the less I know about it St Vincent knew this too and him a clever hand at the paddle yet he left me to run the Box Canyon alone while he walked around Result I was turned over lost half the outfit and all the tobacco and then he put the blame on me besides Right after that he got tangled up with the Lake Le Barge Sticks and both of us came near croaking And why was that Bill Brown interjected All along of a pretty squaw that looked too kindly at him After we got clear I lectured him on women in general and squaws in particular and he promised to behave Then we had a hot time with the Little Salmons He was cuter this time and I didn t know for keeps but I guessed He said it was the medicine man who got horstile but nothing ll stir up a medicine man quicker n women and the facts pointed that way When I talked it over with him in a fatherly way he got wrathy and I had to take him out on the bank and give him a threshing Then he got sulky and didn t brighten up till we ran into the mouth of the Reindeer River where a camp of Siwashes were fishing salmon But he had it in for me all the time only I didn t know it was ready any time to give me the double cross Now there s no denying he s got a taking way with women All he has to do is to whistle em up like dogs Most remarkable faculty that There was the wickedest prettiest squaw among the Reindeers Never saw her beat excepting Bella Well I guess he whistled her up for he delayed in the camp longer than was necessary Being partial to women That will do Mr Bishop interrupted the chairman who from profitless watching of Frona s immobile face had turned to her hand the nervous twitching and clinching of which revealed what her face had hidden That will do Mr Bishop I think we have had enough of squaws Pray do not temper the testimony Frona chirruped sweetly It seems very important Do you know what I am going to say next Del demanded hotly of the chairman You don t eh Then shut up I m running this particular sideshow Bill Brown sprang in to avert hostilities but the chairman restrained himself and Bishop went on I d been done with the whole shooting match squaws and all if you hadn t broke me off Well as I said he had it in for me and the first thing I didn t know he d hit me on the head with a rifle stock bundled the squaw into the canoe and pulled out You all know what the Yukon country was in And there I was without an outfit left alone a thousand miles from anywhere I got out all right though there s no need of telling how and so did he You ve all heard of his adventures in Siberia Well with an impressive pause I happen to know a thing or two myself He shoved a hand into the big pocket of his mackinaw jacket and pulled out a dingy leather bound volume of venerable appearance I got this from Pete Whipple s old woman Whipple of Eldorado It concerns her grand uncle or great grand uncle I don t know which and if there s anybody here can read Russian why it ll go into the details of that Siberian trip But as there s no one here that can Courbertin He can read it some one called in the crowd A way was made for the Frenchman forthwith and he was pushed and shoved protestingly to the front Savve the lingo Del demanded Yes but so poorly so miserable Courbertin demurred It is a long time I forget Go ahead We won t criticise No but Go ahead the chairman commanded Del thrust the book into his hands opened at the yellow title page I ve been itching to get my paws on some buck like you for months and months he assured him gleefully And now I ve got you you can t shake me Charley So fire away Courbertin began hesitatingly The Journal of Father Yakontsk Comprising an Account in Brief of his Life in the Benedictine Monastery at Obidorsky and in Full of his Marvellous Adventures in East Siberia among the Deer Men The baron looked up for instructions Tell us when it was printed Del ordered him In Warsaw The pocket miner turned triumphantly to the room Did you hear that Just keep track of it remember The baron took up the opening paragraph It was because of Tamerlane he commenced unconsciously putting his translation into a construction with which he was already familiar At his first words Frona turned white and she remained white throughout the reading Once she stole a glance at her father and was glad that he was looking straight before him for she did not feel able to meet his gaze just them On the other hand though she knew St Vincent was eying her narrowly she took no notice of him and all he could see was a white face devoid of expression When Tamerlane swept with fire and sword over Eastern Asia Courbertin read slowly states were disrupted cities overthrown and tribes scattered like like star dust A vast people was hurled broadcast over the land Fleeing before the conquerors no no before the mad lust of the conquerors these refugees swung far into Siberia circling circling to the north and east and fringing the rim of the polar basin with a spray of Mongol tribes Skip a few pages Bill Brown advised and read here and there We haven t got all night Courbertin complied The coast people are Eskimo stock merry of nature and not offensive They call themselves the Oukilion or the Sea Men From them I bought dogs and food But they are subject to the Chow Chuen who live in the interior and are known as the Deer Men The Chow Chuen are a fierce and savage race When I left the coast they fell upon me took from me my goods and made me a slave He ran over a few pages I worked my way to a seat among the head men but I was no nearer my freedom My wisdom was of too great value to them for me to depart Old Pi Une was a great chief and it was decreed that I should marry his daughter Ilswunga Ilswunga was a filthy creature She would not bathe and her ways were not good I did marry Ilswunga but she was a wife to me only in name Then did she complain to her father the old Pi Une and he was very wroth And dissension was sown among the tribes but in the end I became mightier than ever what of my cunning and resource and Ilswunga made no more complaint for I taught her games with cards which she might play by herself and other things Is that enough Courbertin asked Yes that will do Bill Brown answered But one moment Please state again the date of publication in Warsaw Hold on baron Del Bishop spoke up Now that you re on the stand I ve got a question or so to slap into you He turned to the court room Gentlemen you ve all heard somewhat of the prisoner s experiences in Siberia You ve caught on to the remarkable sameness between them and those published by Father Yakontsk nearly a hundred years ago And you have concluded that there s been some wholesale cribbing somewhere I propose to show you that it s more than cribbing The prisoner gave me the shake on the Reindeer River in Fall of he was at St Michael s on his way to Siberia and he was by his talk cutting up antics in Siberia he come back to the world working the conquering hero graft in Frisco Now let s see if the Frenchman can make us wise You were in Japan he asked Courbertin who had followed the dates made a quick calculation and could but illy conceal his surprise He looked appealingly to Frona but she did not help him Yes he said finally And you met the prisoner there Yes What year was it There was a general craning forward to catch the answer and it came unwillingly Now how can that be baron Del asked in a wheedling tone The prisoner was in Siberia at that time Courbertin shrugged his shoulders that it was no concern of his and came off the stand An impromptu recess was taken by the court room for several minutes wherein there was much whispering and shaking of heads It is all a lie St Vincent leaned close to Frona s ear but she did not hear Appearances are against me but I can explain it all But she did not move a muscle and he was called to the stand by the chairman She turned to her father and the tears rushed up into her eyes when he rested his hand on hers Do you care to pull out he asked after a momentary hesitation She shook her head and St Vincent began to speak It was the same story he had told her though told now a little more fully and in nowise did it conflict with the evidence of La Flitche and John He acknowledged the wash tub incident caused he explained by an act of simple courtesy on his part and by John Borg s unreasoning anger He acknowledged that Bella had been killed by his own pistol but stated that the pistol had been borrowed by Borg several days previously and not returned Concerning Bella s accusation he could say nothing He could not see why she should die with a lie on her lips He had never in the slightest way incurred her displeasure so even revenge could not be advanced It was inexplicable As for the testimony of Bishop he did not care to discuss it It was a tissue of falsehood cunningly interwoven with truth It was true the man had gone into Alaska with him in but his version of the things which happened there was maliciously untrue Regarding the baron there was a slight mistake in the dates that was all In questioning him Bill Brown brought out one little surprise From the prisoner s story he had made a hard fight against the two mysterious men If Brown asked such were the case how can you explain away the fact that you came out of the struggle unmarked On examination of the body of John Borg many bruises and contusions were noticeable How is it if you put up such a stiff fight that you escaped being battered St Vincent did not know though he confessed to feeling stiff and sore all over And it did not matter anyway He had killed neither Borg nor his wife that much he did know Frona prefaced her argument to the meeting with a pithy discourse on the sacredness of human life the weaknesses and dangers of circumstantial evidence and the rights of the accused wherever doubt arose Then she plunged into the evidence stripping off the superfluous and striving to confine herself to facts In the first place she denied that a motive for the deed had been shown As it was the introduction of such evidence was an insult to their intelligence and she had sufficient faith in their manhood and perspicacity to know that such puerility would not sway them in the verdict they were to give And on the other hand in dealing with the particular points at issue she denied that any intimacy had been shown to have existed between Bella and St Vincent and she denied further that it had been shown that any intimacy had been attempted on the part of St Vincent Viewed honestly the wash tub incident the only evidence brought forward was a laughable little affair portraying how the simple courtesy of a gentleman might be misunderstood by a mad boor of a husband She left it to their common sense they were not fools They had striven to prove the prisoner bad tempered She did not need to prove anything of the sort concerning John Borg They all knew his terrible fits of anger they all knew that his temper was proverbial in the community that it had prevented him having friends and had made him many enemies Was it not very probable therefore that the masked men were two such enemies As to what particular motive actuated these two men she could not say but it rested with them the judges to know whether in all Alaska there were or were not two men whom John Borg could have given cause sufficient for them to take his life Witness had testified that no traces had been found of these two men but the witness had not testified that no traces had been found of St Vincent Pierre La Flitche or John the Swede And there was no need for them so to testify Everybody knew that no foot marks were left when St Vincent ran up the trail and when he came back with La Flitche and the other man Everybody knew the condition of the trail that it was a hard packed groove in the ground on which a soft moccasin could leave no impression and that had the ice not gone down the river no traces would have been left by the murderers in passing from and to the mainland At this juncture La Flitche nodded his head in approbation and she went on Capital had been made out of the blood on St Vincent s hands If they chose to examine the moccasins at that moment on the feet of Mr La Flitche they would also find blood That did not argue that Mr La Flitche had been a party to the shedding of the blood Mr Brown had drawn attention to the fact that the prisoner had not been bruised or marked in the savage encounter which had taken place She thanked him for having done so John Borg s body showed that it had been roughly used He was a larger stronger heavier man than St Vincent If as charged St Vincent had committed the murder and necessarily therefore engaged in a struggle severe enough to bruise John Borg how was it that he had come out unharmed That was a point worthy of consideration Another one was why did he run down the trail It was inconceivable if he had committed the murder that he should without dressing or preparation for escape run towards the other cabins It was however easily conceivable that he should take up the pursuit of the real murderers and in the darkness exhausted breathless and certainly somewhat excited run blindly down the trail Her summing up was a strong piece of synthesis and when she had done the meeting applauded her roundly But she was angry and hurt for she knew the demonstration was for her sex rather than for her cause and the work she had done Bill Brown somewhat of a shyster and his ear ever cocked to the crowd was not above taking advantage when opportunity offered and when it did not offer to dogmatize artfully In this his native humor was a strong factor and when he had finished with the mysterious masked men they were as exploded sun myths which phrase he promptly applied to them They could not have got off the island The condition of the ice for the three or four hours preceding the break up would not have permitted it The prisoner had implicated none of the residents of the island while every one of them with the exception of the prisoner had been accounted for elsewhere Possibly the prisoner was excited when he ran down the trail into the arms of La Flitche and John the Swede One should have thought however that he had grown used to such things in Siberia But that was immaterial the facts were that he was undoubtedly in an abnormal state of excitement that he was hysterically excited and that a murderer under such circumstances would take little account of where he ran Such things had happened before Many a man had butted into his own retribution In the matter of the relations of Borg Bella and St Vincent he made a strong appeal to the instinctive prejudices of his listeners and for the time being abandoned matter of fact reasoning for all potent sentimental platitudes He granted that circumstantial evidence never proved anything absolutely It was not necessary it should Beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt was all that was required That this had been done he went on to review the testimony And finally he said you can t get around Bella s last words We know nothing of our own direct knowledge We ve been feeling around in the dark clutching at little things and trying to figure it all out But gentlemen he paused to search the faces of his listeners Bella knew the truth Hers is no circumstantial evidence With quick anguished breath and life blood ebbing from her and eyeballs glazing she spoke the truth With dark night coming on and the death rattle in her throat she raised herself weakly and pointed a shaking finger at the accused thus and she said Him him him St Vincha him do it With Bill Brown s finger still boring into him St Vincent struggled to his feet His face looked old and gray and he looked about him speechlessly Funk Funk was whispered back and forth and not so softly but what he heard He moistened his lips repeatedly and his tongue fought for articulation It is as I have said he succeeded finally I did not do it Before God I did not do it He stared fixedly at John the Swede waiting the while on his laggard thought I I did not do it I did not I I did not He seemed to have become lost in some supreme meditation wherein John the Swede figured largely and as Frona caught him by the hand and pulled him gently down some man cried out Secret ballot But Bill Brown was on his feet at once No I say no An open ballot We are men and as men are not afraid to put ourselves on record A chorus of approval greeted him and the open ballot began Man after man called upon by name spoke the one word Guilty Baron Courbertin came forward and whispered to Frona She nodded her head and smiled and he edged his way back taking up a position by the door He voted Not guilty when his turn came as did Frona and Jacob Welse Pierre La Flitche wavered a moment looking keenly at Frona and St Vincent then spoke up clear and flute like Guilty As the chairman arose Jacob Welse casually walked over to the opposite side of the table and stood with his back to the stove Courbertin who had missed nothing pulled a pickle keg out from the wall and stepped upon it The chairman cleared his throat and rapped for order Gentlemen he announced the prisoner Hands up Jacob Welse commanded peremptorily and a fraction of a second after him came the shrill Hands up gentlemen of Courbertin Front and rear they commanded the crowd with their revolvers Every hand was in the air the chairman s having gone up still grasping the mallet There was no disturbance Each stood or sat in the same posture as when the command went forth Their eyes playing here and there among the central figures always returned to Jacob Welse St Vincent sat as one dumfounded Frona thrust a revolver into his hand but his limp fingers refused to close on it Come Gregory she entreated Quick Corliss is waiting with the canoe Come She shook him and he managed to grip the weapon Then she pulled and tugged as when awakening a heavy sleeper till he was on his feet But his face was livid his eyes like a somnambulist s and he was afflicted as with a palsy Still holding him she took a step backward for him to come on He ventured it with a shaking knee There was no sound save the heavy breathing of many men A man coughed slightly and cleared his throat It was disquieting and all eyes centred upon him rebukingly The man became embarrassed and shifted his weight uneasily to the other leg Then the heavy breathing settled down again St Vincent took another step but his fingers relaxed and the revolver fell with a loud noise to the floor He made no effort to recover it Frona stooped hurriedly but Pierre La Flitche had set his foot upon it She looked up and saw his hands above his head and his eyes fixed absently on Jacob Welse She pushed at his leg and the muscles were tense and hard giving the lie to the indifference on his face St Vincent looked down helplessly as though he could not understand But this delay drew the attention of Jacob Welse and as he tried to make out the cause the chairman found his chance Without crooking his right arm swept out and down the heavy caulking mallet leaping from his hand It spanned the short distance and smote Jacob Welse below the ear His revolver went off as he fell and John the Swede grunted and clapped a hand to his thigh Simultaneous with this the baron was overcome Del Bishop with hands still above his head and eyes fixed innocently before him had simply kicked the pickle keg out from under the Frenchman and brought him to the floor His bullet however sped harmlessly through the roof La Flitche seized Frona in his arms St Vincent suddenly awakening sprang for the door but was tripped up by the breed s ready foot The chairman pounded the table with his fist and concluded his broken sentence Gentlemen the prisoner is found guilty as charged convening convene
