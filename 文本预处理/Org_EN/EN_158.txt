Vance s work was not by any means accomplished Rather it might be said that he was in the position of a man with a dangerous charge for a gun and no weapon to shoot it He started out to find the gun In fact he already had it in mind Twenty four hours later he was in Craterville Five days out of the ten before the twenty fifth birthday of Terence had elapsed and Vance was still far from his goal but he felt that the lion s share of the work had been accomplished Craterville was a day s ride across the mountains from the Cornish ranch and it was the county seat It was one of those towns which spring into existence for no reason that can be discovered and cling to life generations after they should have died But Craterville held one thing of which Vance Cornish was in great need and that was Sheriff Joe Minter familiarly called Uncle Joe His reason for wanting the sheriff was perfectly simple Uncle Joe Minter was the man who killed Black Jack Hollis He had been a boy of eighteen then shooting with a rifle across a window sill That shot had formed his life He was now forty two and he had spent the interval as the professional enemy of criminals in the mountains For the glory which came from the killing of Black Jack had been sweet to the youthful palate of Minter and he had cultivated his taste He became the most dreaded manhunter in those districts where manhunting was most common He had been sheriff at Craterville for a dozen years now and still his supremacy was not even questioned Vance Cornish was lucky to find the sheriff in town presiding at the head of the long table of the hotel at dinner He was a man of great dignity He wore his stiff black hair still untarnished by gray very long brushing it with difficulty to keep it behind his ears This mass of black hair framed a long stern face the angles of which had been made by years But there was no sign of weakness He had grown dry not flabby His mouth was a thin straight line and his fighting chin jutted out in profile He rose from his place to greet Vance Cornish Indeed the sheriff acted the part of master of ceremonies at the hotel having a sort of silent understanding with the widow who owned the place It was said that the sheriff would marry the woman sooner or later he so loved to talk at her table His talk doubled her business Her table afforded him an audience so they needed one another You don t remember me said Vance I got a tolerable poor memory for faces admitted the sheriff I m Cornish of the Cornish ranch The sheriff was duly impressed The Cornish ranch was a show place He arranged a chair for Vance at his right and presently the talk rose above the murmur to which it had been depressed by the arrival of this important stranger The increasing noise made a background It left Vance alone with the sheriff And how do you find your work sheriff asked Vance for he knew that Uncle Joe Minter s great weakness was his love of talk Everyone in the mountains knew it for that matter Dull complained Minter Men ain t what they used to be or else the law is a heap stronger The men who enforce the law are said Vance The sheriff absorbed this patent compliment with the blank eye of satisfaction and rubbed his chin But they s been some talk of rustling pretty recent I m waiting for it to grow and get ripe Then I ll bust it He made an eloquent gesture which Vance followed He was distinctly pleased with the sheriff For Minter was wonderfully preserved His face seemed five years younger than his age His body seemed even younger round smooth powerful muscles padding his shoulders and stirring down the length of his big arms And his hands had that peculiar light restlessness of touch which Vance remembered to have seen in the hands of Terence Colby alias Hollis And how s things up your way continued the sheriff Booming By the way how long is it since you ve seen the ranch Never been there Bear Creek Valley has always been a quiet place since the Cornishes moved in and they ain t been any call for a gent in my line of business up that way He grinned with satisfaction and Vance nodded If times are dull why not drop over We re having a celebration there in five days Come and look us over Maybe I might and maybe I mightn t said the sheriff All depends And bring some friends with you insisted Vance Then he wisely let the subject drop and went on to a detailed description of the game in the hills around the ranch That he knew would bring the sheriff if anything would But he mentioned the invitation no more There were particular reasons why he must not press it on the sheriff any more than on others in Craterville The next morning before traintime Vance went to the post office and left the article on Black Jack addressed to Terence Colby at the Cornish ranch The addressing was done on a typewriter which completely removed any means of identifying the sender Vance played with Providence in only one way He was so eager to strike his blow at the last possible moment that he asked the postmaster to hold the letter for three days which would land it at the ranch on the morning of the birthday Then he went to the train His self respect was increasing by leaps and bounds The game was still not won but starring with absolutely nothing in six days he had planted a charge which might send Elizabeth s twenty four years of labor up in smoke He got off the train at Preston the station nearest the ranch and took a hired team up the road along Bear Creek Gorge They debouched out of the Blue Mountains into the valley of the ranch in the early evening and Vance found himself looking with new eyes on the little kingdom He felt the happiness indeed of one who has lost a great prize and then put himself in a fair way of winning it back They dipped into the valley road Over the tops of the big silver spruces he traced the outline of Sleep Mountain against the southern sky Who but Vance or the dwellers in the valley would be able to duly appreciate such beauty If there were any wrong in what he had done this thought consoled him the ends justified the means Now as they drew closer through the branches he made out glimpses of the dim white front of the big house on the hill That big cool house with the kingdom spilled out at its feet the farming lands the pastures of the hills and the rich forest of the upper mountains Certainty
