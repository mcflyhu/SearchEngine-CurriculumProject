Henrietta Hen ran as fast as she could down the bank and stood as near the water as she dared cackling loudly and flapping her wings Her child who was swimming in the duck pond seemed to have no intention of minding her Nor did he seem to have any intention of drowning and as for getting his feet wet he acted as if he liked that What shall I do Oh what shall I do Henrietta Hen squawked She made so much noise that some of her neighbors came a running to see what was the matter And as soon as they discovered what had happened they began to laugh We may as well tell you they said to Henrietta Hen that that chap out there is a duckling The water won t hurt him Henrietta Hen gasped and gaped She was astonished But she soon pulled herself together And it was just like her to begin to boast See she cried to her friends and waved a wing toward the water with an air of pride There isn t one of you that has a child that can beat him swimming I should hope not said Polly Plymouth Rock with a shrug of her fine shoulders And all the others agreed that they wanted no swimmers in their families Henrietta Hen announced that she was sorry for them Every brood she declared should have at least one swimmer in it She began to strut up and down the edge of the duck pond clucking in a most overbearing fashion Really she had never felt quite so important before not even when her first brood pecked their way out of their shells There s nothing quite like swimming Henrietta Hen remarked with a silly smirk If it weren t for getting my feet wet I d be tempted to learn myself No doubt my son could teach me Your son the old white hen sniffed He s not your son Henrietta Hen Somebody played a joke on you Somebody put a duck s egg under you while you were hatching your eggs And I think I can guess who it was that did it For just a moment Henrietta Hen stood still The news almost took her breath away Her comb trembled on the top of her head She even stopped clucking And she looked from one to another of her companions as if in hopes of finding one face at least that looked doubtful Alas Everybody appeared to agree with old Whitey If this is so Henrietta muttered at last it s strange nobody ever noticed before that there was a duckling in my brood We knew from the very first Polly Plymouth Rock told her You were the only one on the farm that didn t see that one of your family was different from the rest All this time the young duckling was swimming further and further away He seemed to have forgotten all about his foster mother Henrietta Hen took one long last look at him She guessed that she might have stood there forever cackling for him to come back and he wouldn t have paid the slightest heed to her Then she gathered her children her really own about her Come she said to them We ll go back home now What about him they demanded pointing to the truant duckling who was bobbing about on the rippling water Aren t you going to make him come too No said their mother We re well rid of him He has been more trouble to me than all the rest of you To tell the truth I never liked him very well gasped v gasp She gasped at the wonderful view People gasped with admiration at the superb skill of the gymnasts gaped v gape A huge chasm gaped before them The front door was missing A hole gaped in the roof shrug v With a shrug he went out of the room I admire the way she is able to shrug off unfair criticism strut v n The circulation economy development needs the green science and technology innovation as the strut Now we ll strut arm and arm smirk n v He made no attempt to conceal his smirk She had a selfsatisfied smirk on her face tempted v tempt I was sorely tempted to complain but I didn t I was tempted by the dessert menu sniffed v sniff When Jenney had stopped crying she sniffed and dried her eyes The dog sniffed suspiciously at the stranger alas int Alas The window is broken Alas the truth is less romantic heed v n You must take heed of what he has told For the first time he had to pay heed to his appearance truant n adj v I found the truant throwing stones in the river Children who play truant from school are unimaginative rippling I could see the dawn breeze rippling the shining water The pool rippling was caused by the waving of the reeds
