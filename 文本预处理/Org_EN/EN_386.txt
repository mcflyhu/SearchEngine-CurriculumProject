Peter s room was the smallest and highest in the boarding house It was extremely small and high and just above the bed was a ceiling that got hot through and through like a warming pan so that the room in summer was like a little oven below What air there was came in came through a small skylight above the wash stand through this also came the rain when it rained the dirtiest rain Peter had ever seen It was not raining this morning when Peter after passing a very warm night heard the bells beginning A great many bells begin on Sunday mornings in this part of London no doubt in any part of London but here they seem particularly loud The boarding house was in a small street close to a large English church and a small Roman church and the English church had its first Mass at seven and the Roman church at six and each had another an hour later and bells rang for all So Peter lay and listened Sometimes he went with Hilary and Peggy to the Roman Mass That pleased Peggy who had hopes of some day converting him And occasionally he went alone to the English Mass and he liked that better on the whole because the little Roman church was rather ugly Peter didn t think he would ever join the Roman church even to please Peggy It certainly seemed to him in some ways the most finely expressive of the churches but equally certainly it often expressed the wrong things and like all other churches left whole worlds unexpressed And so much of its expression had a crudity It kept saying too little and too much and jarring Anyhow this morning Peter who had a headache after his warm night lay and heard the bells and thought what a nice day Sunday was with no office to go to Instead he would take Rhoda on the river in the morning and go and see Lucy in the afternoon and probably have tea there When Peter went to see Lucy he always had a faint hope that Urquhart would perhaps walk in and that they would all be friendly and happy together in the old way for one afternoon It hadn t happened yet Peter hadn t seen Urquhart since they had left Venice two months ago Sunday was his day for going to see Lucy and it wasn t Urquhart s day perhaps because Urquhart was so often away for week ends though last Sunday indeed he had just left the Hopes house when Peter arrived Lucy when Peter had told her his tale of dishonour two months ago had said half laughing at him How stupid of all of you She hadn t realised quite how much it mattered Lucy judged everything by a queer withdrawn standard of her own Peter had agreed that it had been exceedingly stupid of all of them Once since then when he heard that Urquhart had returned and had seen Lucy he had asked her Does he dislike us all very much Is he quite too disgusted to want to see me again Lucy had wrinkled her forehead over it He s not angry she had said You can fancy can t you Merely merely Detached said Peter who had more words and always expressed what Lucy meant and she nodded Just that you know She had looked at him wistfully hoping he wasn t minding too horribly much It s stupid of him she had said using her favourite adjective and had added dubiously Come and meet him sometime You can t go on like this it s too silly Peter had shaken his head I won t till he wants to I don t want to bother him you see He does want to Lucy had told him Of course he does Only he thinks you don t That s what s so silly They had left it there for the present Some day Peter meant to walk into Denis s rooms and say Don t be stupid This can t go on But the day hadn t come yet If it had been Denis who had done the shady thing and was in penury and dishonour thereby it would have been so simple But that was inconceivable such things didn t happen to Denis and as it was it was not simple Peter got out of his hot bed on to his hot floor and made for the bathroom There was only one bathroom in the boarding house but there was no great competition for it so Peter had his bath in peace and sang a tune in it as was his custom and came back to his hot room and put on his hot clothes his less tidy clothes because it was the day of joy and came down to breakfast at Most of the other boarders had got there before him It was a mixed boarding house and contained at the moment two gentlemen besides Hilary and Peter and five ladies besides Peggy and Rhoda They were on the whole a happy and even gay society and particularly on Sundays Peggy looking up from the tea cups gave Peter a broad smile and Rhoda gave him a little subdued one and Peter looked pleased to see everyone he always did even on Mondays I m sure your brother hasn t a care in the world an envious lady boarder had once said to Peggy he s always so happy looking This was the lady who was saying as Peter entered And my mother s last words were Find Elizabeth Dean s grave Elizabeth Dean was an author you know oh very well known I believe She treated my mother and me none too well didn t stand by us when she should have but we won t say anything about that now Anyhow it was a costly funeral forty pounds and eight horses and my mother hadn t an idea where she was laid So she said Find Elizabeth Dean s grave just like that And the strange thing was that in the first churchyard I walked into in a little village down in Sussex there was a tombstone Elizabeth Dean The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away Wasn t that queer now So I went straight and The woman s a fool muttered the gentleman next Peter a cynical faced commercial traveller Peter had heard the remark from him frequently before and did not feel called upon to reply to it But the tale of Elizabeth Dean was interrupted by a lady of a speculative habit of mind Now I want to ask you all should one put up a tombstone to the departed I ve been having quite a kick up with my sisters about it lately Hadn t one better spend the money on the living What do you think Miss Matthews Miss Matthews said she liked to see a handsome headstone After all one honours them that way It s all one can do for them isn t it Oh Miss Matthews all Several ladies were shocked What about one s prayers for the dead I don t pray for the dead said Miss Matthews who was a protestant and did not attend the large church in the next street I do not belong to the Romish religion I m not saying anything against those who do but I consider that those who do not should confine their prayers to those who may require them in this troubled world and not waste them upon those whose fate we have every reason to believe is settled once and for all The lady who always quarrelled with her on this subject rose to the occasion Peggy soothing them down said mechanically There now Three lumps Peter Micky one doesn t suck napkin rings naughty Peter was appealed to by his neighbour who knew that he occasionally attended St Austin s church People were always drawing him into theological discussions which he knew nothing at all about Mr Peter isn t that against all reason to stop praying for our friends merely because they ve passed through the veil Yes Peter agreed I should have thought so But all he really thought was that beyond the veil was such darkness that he never looked into it and that it was a pity people should argue on a holiday Now said someone else wishing to be a peace maker I m afraid you ll all say I m very naughty but I attend the early Mass at St Austin s high Mass at the Roman church she nodded at Peggy and the City Temple in the evening she smiled at the commercial traveller who was believed to be a New Theologian Aren t I naughty now Mademoiselle the French governess came down at this point saying she had had a dream about a hat with pink roses The peace making lady said Bad little thing she s quite frisky this morning Hilary to whom Mademoiselle was the last straw left the room Rhoda followed his example She had sat very silent as usual over breakfast eating little Peter came out with her and followed her into the sitting room where she stood listlessly playing with the tassel of the blind Rhoda was thinner than ever and floppier and took even less pains to be neat She had left off her beads but had not replaced them by a collar Peter said Are you coming out with me this morning She replied listless and uncaring If you like We might go said Peter and see if the New English Art Club is open on Sunday mornings And then we ll go on the river Shall we She assented again Very well A moment later she sighed and said wearily How it does go on day after day doesn t it Peter said it did On and on said Rhoda Same stupid people saying the same stupid old things I do wonder they don t get tired They don t know anything do they Rhoda s hankering was still after Great Minds They re funny sometimes suggested Peter tentatively but she was blind to that They don t know a thing And they talk and talk so stupidly About religion as if one religion was different from another And about dead people as if they knew all about them and what they were doing They seem to make sure souls go on Miss Matthews and Miss Baker were both sure of that But how can they tell Some people that know lots more than them don t think so but say say it s nothingness Peter recognised Guy Vyvian s word Rhoda would have said nothing to follow People say he agreed quite different things and none of them know anything about it of course One needn t worry though You never worry she accused him half fretfully But she added you don t preach either You don t say things are so when you can t know Do you think anything about that Peter about going on I don t believe you do Peter reflected No he said I don t believe I do I can t look beyond what I can see and touch I don t try I expect I m a materialist The colours and shapes of things matter so awfully much I can t imagine anything of them going on when those are dead I rather wish I could Some people that know lots more than me do and I think it s splendid of them and for them They re very likely right too you know Rhoda shook her head I believe it s nothingness Peter felt it a dreary subject and changed it Well let s come and look at pictures And I can t imagine nothingness can you We might have lunch out somewhere if you don t mind So they went out and looked at pictures and went up the river in a steamer and had lunch out somewhere and Rhoda grew very gentle and more cheerful and said I didn t mean to be cross to you Peter You re ever so good to me and winked away tears and the gentle Peter who hated no one wished that some catastrophe would wipe Guy Vyvian off the face of the earth and choke his memory with dust Whenever one thought Rhoda was getting rather better the image of Vyvian who knew such a lot more than most people came up between her and the world she ought to have been enjoying and she had a relapse Peter and Rhoda came home together and Rhoda said Thank you ever so much for taking me I ve liked it ever so and went up to her room to read poetry Rhoda read a good deal of the work of our lesser contemporary poets Vyvian had instilled that taste into her Peter about tea time went to see Lucy He went by the Piccadilly tube from Holborn to South Kensington he was being recklessly extravagant to day but it was a holiday after all and very hot Peter climbed the stairs to the Hopes drawing room and opened the door and what he had often dreamed of had come about for Denis was there only in a strange undreamed of way that made him giddy so he stood quite still for a moment and looked He would have turned away and gone before they saw him but they had seen him and Lucy said Oh Peter come in and Denis said Oh hullo and held out his hand Peter who was dizzily readjusting certain rather deeply rooted ideas said How do you do I ve come I ve come to tea you know Course you have said Lucy Then she looked up into Peter s face and smiled and slipped her hand into his How nice we re three again Yes said Peter But I must go said Urquhart I m awfully sorry but I ve got to meet a man I shall see you some time shan t I Margery Why don t you ever come and see me you slacker Well good bye Good bye Lucy Lunch to morrow don t forget He was gone Peter sat on the coal scuttle and Lucy gave him tea with three lumps in it Thank you said Peter Lucy looked at him You did know didn t you All this time I mean I didn t tell you because I never tell you things of course You always know them And this particularly You did know it Peter But when you came in you looked you looked as if you didn t I was stupid said Peter I ought to have known Looking back he saw that he certainly ought He certainly must have only that his vision had been blocked by a certain deeply rooted idea that was as old as his growth He had assumed without words He had thought that she too had assumed neither had ever required words to elucidate their ideas one to the other they had kept words for the other things the jolly delightful things of the foreground How long asked Peter drinking his tea to warm him for though it was so hot outside he felt very cold in here She told him Oh since the beginning I think I thought you knew Peter We didn t say anything about it till quite lately Only we both knew She came and sat on the rug by his side and slipped her hand into his Are you glad Peter Please Peter be glad I will presently said Peter with one of his fainter smiles Let me just get used to it and I will She whispered stroking his hand We ve always had such fun Peter we three Haven t we Let s go on having it Yes said Peter Let s He was vague still and a little dizzy but he could smile at her now After all wasn t it splendid Denis and Lucy the two people he loved best in the world so immeasurably best that beside them everyone else was no class at all He sat very still on the coal scuttle making a fresh discovery about himself He had known before that he had a selfish disposition though he had never thought about it particularly but he hadn t known that it was in him to grudge Denis anything Denis who was consciously more to him than anyone else in the world Lucy was different she was rooted in the very fibre of his being it wasn t so much that he consciously loved her as that she was his other self Well hadn t he long since given to Denis to use as he would all the self he had But the wrench made him wince and left him chilly and grown old It s perfectly splendid for both of you said Peter himself again at last And it was extraordinarily stupid of me not to see it before Do you think Denis really meant I could go and see him I think I will Course he did Course you will Go to morrow But now it s going to be just you and me and tea And honey sandwiches oh Peter Her eyes danced at him because it was such a nice world He came off the coal scuttle and made himself comfortable in a low chair near the honey sandwiches Will you and Denis try always to have them when I come to tea with you I do love them so Have you arranged when it is to be by the way No Father won t want it to be for ages he won t like it to be at all of course because Denis isn t poor or miserable or revolutionary But Felicity has done so nicely for him in that way Lawrence is getting into horrid rows in Poland you know that I think I ve a right to someone happy and clean don t you And Denis wants it to be soon So I suppose it will be soon Sure to be Peter agreed The room was full of roses their sweetness was exuberant intoxicating not like Lucy who usually had small pale faint flowers Isn t it funny she said how one thinks one can t be any happier and then suddenly something happens inside one and one sees everything new I used to think things couldn t be brighter and shine more but now they glitter like the sun all new I expect so said Peter Then she had a little stab of remorse for Peter had been turned out of the place of glittering things and moved in a grey and dusty world among things no one could like Tis so stupid that your work is like that she said with puckered forehead I wish you could find something nice to do Peter dear Oh I m all right said Peter And there are all the nice things which aren t work just the same Rhoda and I went a ride in a steamer this morning And the sun was shining on the water rather nice it was Even Rhoda grew a little brighter to see it Poor Rhoda the boarders do worry her so I m sorry about it they don t worry me I rather like them Some day soon I want you to come and see Rhoda it would cheer her up I wish she liked things more She s left off her bead necklace you know And she gets worried because people discuss the condition of the departed that s what we call them in the boarding house Rhoda is sure they are in nothingness I told her it was impossible for me to speculate on such things How can one you know People have so much imagination Mine always sticks at a certain point and won t move on Could you do it if someone asked you to imagine Denis say without his body She wrinkled her forehead trying to Denis s body matters a lot was her conclusion I suppose it s because it s such a nice one Exactly said Peter People s bodies are nice And when they re not I don t believe their minds are very nice either so I d rather not think about them Now I must go home It was very hot going home London was a baked place full of used air Peter s bedroom on a large scale Peter tried walking back but found he was rather giddy so got into a bus that took him the wrong way a thing he often did Riding across London on the top of a bus is of course the greatest fun even if it is the wrong bus It makes up for almost any misfortune A few days later after office hours Peter took Urquhart at his word and went to his rooms Urquhart wasn t there but would be in some time he was told so he sat and waited for him It was a pleasant change after the boarding house rooms Urquhart s things were nice to look at without being particularly artistic There was nothing dingy or messy or second rate or cheap A graceful careless expensiveness was the dominant note An aroma of good tobacco hung about Peter liked to smell good tobacco though he smoked none good or bad Urquhart came in at seven o clock He was going to dine somewhere at eight so he hadn t much time Glad to see you Margery Quite time you came Peter thought it nice of him to speak so pleasantly seeming to ignore the last time Peter had come to see him He had been restrained and embarrassed then now he was friendly in the old casual unemphasised way How splendid about you and Lucy said Peter A very suitable alliance I call it So do I said Denis lighting a cigarette She s so much the nicest person I know I perceived that the day you introduced us Of course said Peter You would Do you mind said Denis if I dress We can talk meanwhile Rotten luck that I m booked for dinner or we could have had it together You must come another day While he dressed he told Peter that he was going to stand at the next elections Peter had known before that Denis was ultimately destined to assist in the government of his country and now it appeared that the moment had arrived Do you really take a side Peter enquired Or is it just a funny game Oh of course it s a game too most things are But of course one s a Conservative and all that if one s a person of sense It s the only thing to be you know I rather like both sides said Peter They re both so keen and so sure they re right But I expect Conservatives are the rightest because they want to keep things I hate people who want to make a mess and break things up and throw them away Besides I suppose one couldn t really be on the same side as what s his name that man everyone dislikes so could one or any of those violent people Urquhart said one certainly couldn t Besides there were Free Trade and Home Rule and dozens of other things to be considered Obviously Conservatives were right I ought to get in he said unless anything upsets it The unionist majority last time was two hundred and fifty Peter laughed It was rather nice to hear Denis talking like a real candidate When Denis was ready he said I m dining in Norfolk Street Can you walk with me part of the way Peter said it was on the way to Brook Street where he lived Denis displayed no interest in Brook Street As far as he intended to cultivate Peter s acquaintance it was to be as a unit detached from his disgraceful relatives Peter understood that As he hadn t much expected to be cultivated again at all he was in good spirits as he walked with Denis to Norfolk Street No word passed between them as to Peter s past disgrace or present employment Denis had an easy way of sliding lightly over embarrassing subjects They parted and Denis dined in
