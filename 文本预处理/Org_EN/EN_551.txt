Every summer afternoon the trade winds blow through San Francisco winging their way across miles of chill salt sea and striking the bulwarked city with a boisterous impact The long streets seem as paths lines of least resistance and the winds press themselves into the narrow limits and whoop buoyantly along carrying before them dust rags scraps of paper sometimes hats Their period of highest recognized activity is from May till September but before that vagrant breezes skirmishers sent out in advance assault the city They follow on still sunny mornings which show not the slightest warning symptom of the riotous forces which are designing to seize upon and disrupt the tranquillity of the afternoon Eleven sees them up and stirring by midday they have begun the attack The city in a state of complete unpreparedness is at their mercy and they sweep through it in arrogant triumph veiled in a flying scud of dust Unsuspecting wayfarers meet them at corners and stand helpless victims[ ] of a playfulness fierce and disconcerting as that of tigers Hats cleverly running on one rim career along the sidewalk Ladies have difficulties with parasols heretofore docile and well behaved Articles of dress accustomed to hang decorously show sudden ambitions to rise and ride the elements And those very people who in winter speak gratefully of the winds as the scavengers of San Francisco may be heard calling curses down on them Such a wind the first of the season was abroad on a bright morning in early April and Cornelia Ryan was out in it It was a great morning for Cornelia Even the wind could not ruffle her joyousness She was engaged Two evenings before Jack Duffy who had been hovering round the subject for a month poised above it as a hawk above delightful prey had at last descended and Cornelia s anxieties were at an end She had been so relieved elated and flustered that she had not been able to pretend the proper surprise but had accepted blushing stammering and radiant She had been blushing stammering and radiant when she told her mother that night and to day forty eight hours later she was still blushing stammering and radiant It was not alone that she was honestly in love with Jack but Cornelia like most maidens in California and elsewhere was in love with being admired deferred to and desired And despite[ ] her great expectations and her prominent position she had had rather less of this kind of delightful flattery than most girls Walking down town in the clear sun lit morning she was if not handsome of a fresh and blooming wholesomeness which is almost as attractive and generally wears better The passers by might readily have set her down as a charming woman for whom men sighed and in this surmise been far from the mark She had had few lovers before Jack Duffy That matter of fact sturdiness that absence of softness and mystery so noticeable in Californian women was particularly accentuated in her case and had robbed her of the poetic charm of which beauty and wealth can never take the place But to day she was radiant a sublimated exultant Cornelia loved at last and by a man of whom she could completely and unreservedly approve There were times when Cornelia she was thirty had feared that she might have to go abroad and acquire a foreign husband or worse still move to New York and make her selection from such relics of decayed Knickerbocker families as were in the market She was woman enough to refuse to die unwed Now these dark possibilities were dispelled In her own state in her own town she had found her mate Jack Duffy whose father had known her father and been shift boss under Bill Cannon in the roaring days of Virginia City It was like[ ] royalty marrying into its own order the royalty of Far Western millions knowing its own ramifications having its own unprinted Almanach de Gotha deep calling unto deep The wind was not yet out in force its full steady sweep would not be inaugurated till early in the afternoon It came now in gusts which fell upon Cornelia from the back and accelerated her forward progress throwing out on either side of her a flapping sail of skirt Cornelia who was neat and precise usually resented this rough handling but to day she only laughed leaning back with one hand holding her hat In the shops where she stopped to execute various commissions she had difficulty in suppressing her smiles She would have liked to delay over her purchases and chat with the saleswomen and ask them about their families and send those who looked tired off for a month into the country It was after midday when she found herself approaching that particular block along the edge of which the flower venders place their baskets and display their wares In brilliantly colored mounds the flowers stood stacked along the outer rim of the sidewalk a line of them a man behind each basket vociferating the excellence of the bouquet he held forward to the passer s inspection In the blaze of sun that overlaid them the piled up blossoms showed high colored and variegated as a strip of carpeting [ ]Cornelia never bought flowers at the street corners The town house was daily supplied from the greenhouses at the country place at Menlo When sick friends anniversaries or entertainment called for special offerings they were ordered from expensive florists and came in made up bunches decorated with sashes of ribbon But to day she hesitated before the line of laden baskets Some of the faces behind them looked so dreary and Cornelia could not brook the sight of a dreary face on this day of joy The dark wistful eyes of an Italian boy holding out a bunch of faded jack roses stiffly set in a fringe of fern made a sudden appeal to her and she bought the roses Then the old man who was selling carnations looked so lean and grizzled that he must be cheered and two bunches of the carnations were added to the roses The boys and men seeing that the brilliant lady was in a generous mood collected about her shouting out the excellences of their particular blossoms and pressing sample bunches on her attention Cornelia amused and somewhat bewildered looked at the faces and bought recklessly She was stretching out her hand to beckon to the small boy with the wilted pansies who was not big enough to press through the throng when a man s voice behind her caught her ear Well Cornelia are you trying to corner the curb stone market [ ]She wheeled swiftly and saw her brother laughing and looking at the stacked flowers in the crook of her arm Dominick she exclaimed you re just the person I want to see I was going to write to you I ve got lots to tell you Come along then and take lunch with me I was on my way up to Bertrand s when I saw you They ll give us a good lunch there and you can tell me all your secrets The flower sellers who had been listening with unabashed eagerness realized that their prey was about to be ravished from them and raised their voices in a chorus of wailing appeal As Cornelia moved forward they moved round her thrusting bouquets under her eyes in a last hope the boy with the wilted pansies on the brink of tears hanging on the outskirts of the crowd Cornelia might have forgotten him but her eye sweeping back for an absent moment saw his face bereft of all hope a face of childish despair above his drooping pansies Here boy with the pansies she called and sent a silver dollar through the air toward him that s for you Keep it and the flowers too I ve too many now and can t carry any more Maybe he ll sell them to some one else she said to Dominick as they crossed the street He s such a little boy to be earning his bread They walked up the street toward Bertrand s [ ] a French restaurant which for years had enjoyed the esteem of the city s gourmets The wind was now very high It tore at Cornelia s clothes and made it necessary for Dominick to hold his hat on his hand spread flat on the crown A trail of blossoms torn from the flowers each carried sprinkled the pavement behind them Cornelia with her head down and her face toward her brother shouted remarks at him every now and then pausing in a stifle of laughter to struggle with her draperies which at one moment rose rebellious and at the next were wound about her in an umbrella like sheath They had often met this way in the past when the elder Mrs Ryan s wrath had been in its first untameable freshness and her son had seen her seldom In those days of estrangement Cornelia had been the tie between Dominick and his home She loved her brother and was sorry for him and had felt the bitterness of the separation not alone as a family misfortune but as a scandal over which mean people talked Had it rested with her she would long ago have overlooked the past and have opened the door to her sister in law Not that she felt any regard or interest in Berny Iverson her feeling for her was now and always would be largely composed of that undying unfriendliness and repugnance that the naturally virtuous woman feels for her sister with the tache But Cornelia was of a younger and[ ] milder generation than her mother She had not fought hard for what she had and like Dominick there was more of the sunny tempered soft hearted Con Ryan in her than of the strong and valiant woman who had made him and given him his place in the world In the restaurant they found a vacant table in a corner and Cornelia had to bottle up her good news while Dominick pondered over the bill of fare She was impatient and drummed on the table with her fingers while her eyes roamed about the room Once or twice she bowed to people that she knew then let her glance pass in an uninterested survey over the bare walls and the long line of windows that gave on the street The place had an austerely severe unadorned air Its bleakness of naked wall and uncovered stone floor added to the foreignness that was contributed by the strong French accent of the waiters and the arrangement of a cashier s desk near the door where a pleasant faced woman sat between a large bouquet of roses and a drowsy gray cat The orders given and the first stages of lunch appearing Cornelia could at last claim her brother s full attention Planting her elbows on the table and staring at him she said I told you how awfully anxious I was to see you and how I was going to write to you didn t I [ ]Dominick nodded He was buttering a piece of bread and showed no particular acceleration of curiosity at this query Well now what do you suppose I was going to write about asked his sister already beginning to show a heightened color Can t imagine Nothing wrong with mother I hope Since his marriage Cornelia had been in the habit of communicating frequently with her brother by letter It was the best way of keeping him informed of family affairs The telephone at the senior Ryan house was sufficiently secluded to make it a useful medium of private communication but the telephone at the junior Ryan house did not share this peculiarity and Dominick discouraged his sister s using it No mother s all right said Cornelia And it s nothing wrong about anybody Quite the other way it s something about me and it s something cheerful Guess Her brother looked up and his eye was caught by her rosily blushing cheeks Dear me Cornie he said with a look of slowly dawning comprehension it really isn t it really can t be The waiter here interrupted further confidence by setting forth the lunch with many attentive bowings and murmurings By the time he had presented one dish for Cornelia s approval [ ] removed it with a flourish and presented another her impatience broke out in an imploring Yes Etienne it s all perfectly lovely Do put it on the table and let s eat it That s what it s for not to hand round and be stared at as if it were a diamond necklace that I was thinking of buying Etienne thus appealed to put the viands on the table and Dominick deeply interested leaned forward and said What is it Go ahead I m burning up with curiosity Guess said his sister bending over her plate Is it that you re going to be married Oh Cornie it can t be And why can t it be looking very much hurt What s there so queer about that Nothing only I meant that I hadn t heard any rumors about it Is it that Yes it is Dominick Ryan and I don t see why you should be so surprised Surprised I m more than surprised I m delighted haven t been so pleased for years Who is it Jack Duffy Oh Cornie that s the best yet That s great It s splendid I wish I could kiss you but I can t here in the open restaurant Why didn t you tell me somewhere where we would be alone I d just like to give you a good hug [ ]Cornelia who had been a little hurt at her brother s incredulity was now entirely mollified and once again became bashfully complacent I thought you d like it she said I thought you d think that was just about right Any girl would be proud of him He s one of the best fellows in the state one of the best anywhere He ll make you a first rate husband You re a lucky girl I know I am You needn t tell me There are not many men anywhere like Jack Duffy I ve always said I wouldn t marry the tag rag and bobtail other girls are satisfied with My husband was going to be a gentleman and if Jack s anything he s that You re right there He s one of Nature s gentlemen the real kind Cornelia thought this savored of condescension and said rallying to the defense of her future lord Well that s all right but he s educated too He s not one of those men who have good hearts and noble yearnings but look like anarchists or sewing machine agents Jack graduated high at Harvard He went there when he was only eighteen There s no one s had a better education or done better by it His father may have been Irish and worked as shift boss on the Rey del Monte but Jack s quite different He s just as much of a gentleman as anybody in this country Cornelia s attitude on matters of genealogy was[ ] modern and Californian Ireland was far behind her and Jack as were also those great days in Nevada of which her mother and Bill Cannon spoke as the returned Ulysses might have spoken of the ten years before Troy She and Jack would eventually regard them as a period of unsophistication and social ferment which it were wisest to touch on lightly and of which they would teach their children nothing And then Cornelia went on determined not to slight any detail of her fiance s worthiness there s never been anything fast or wild about Jack He s always been straight There s been no scandalous stories about him as there have about Terence Never Terence committed all the scandals for the family Well Terence is in New York thank Heaven said Cornelia with pious fervor and we won t have to have anything to do with him or his wife either Even if we go to Europe we need only stay there a few days The irregular career of Terence had been a thorn in the side of the respectable Duffys he some years earlier having married his mistress a chorus girl in a local theater and attempted to force her upon the exclusive circles in which his people moved It was not the least galling feature of Terence s unconventional course that having doubled his fortune by successful speculations [ ] he had removed to New York where after several spirited assaults and vigorous rebuffs his wife had reached social heights toward which other Californians of spotless record and irreproachable character had clambered in vain Well said Dominick mother ought to be satisfied with this marriage It s a good thing one of her children is going to settle down the way she likes Oh she s delighted She s not been in such good spirits for a long time and she s as interested as I am in arranging everything We want to have a large house wedding the two families and all their connections and all our intimate friends and all the people who ve entertained us and and the whole crowd Of course it ll be a lot of people Mommer said she didn t see how we could cut it down to less than five or six hundred But I don t see why we need to the house is big enough Plenty said Dominick He set down his knife and fork and looked at his sister Our family don t take up much room There s just three of us Then you re coming she said quickly her anxiety flashing out into an almost pained intensity of eagerness You ll come You must Dominick You ve got to give me away He looked away from her in moody discomfort The eternal discussions created by his marriage[ ] were becoming more and more hateful to him Why should his unloved and unloving wife perpetually stand between him and his own people his mother and sister women to whom he owed allegiance even as he did to her The call of his home and the binding ties of kin were growing stronger as the obligation of his marriage had weakened and lost its hold Cornelia leaned across the table and spoke with low toned almost tremulous earnestness You know that if it were I I d ask your wife You know that all the hard feelings I may once have had against her have gone If it were for me to say I d have received her from the start What I ve always said is What s the good of keeping up these fights No one gets anything by them They don t do any one any good But you know mommer The first thing she said when we talked about the house wedding and I said you d give me away was If he ll come without his wife Those were her very words and you know when she says a thing she means it And Dominick you will come You re the only brother I ve got You re the only man representative of the family You can t turn me down on my wedding day There were tears in her eyes and Dominick saw them and looked down at his plate All right he said quietly I ll come When is it to be [ ] Oh Dominick his sister breathed in an ecstasy of relief and gratitude I knew you would And I ll do anything for you I can If mommer wouldn t get so dreadfully angry I d call on your wife but you know I can t offend her She s my mother and I can t stand up against her But some day I ll pay you back I will indeed Oh that s all right Cornie he said turning to summon the waiter I can t let my sister get married without me Tell mother I ll come You haven t yet told me when it s to be June said the prospective bride once more beginning to blush and beam early in June The roses are so fine then and we can have the house so beautifully decorated We ve already begun to plan the trousseau It s going to be just stunning I tell you the dresses from New York and all the lingerie and things like that from Paris Mommer says she ll give me fifteen thousand dollars for it And she s going to give me besides a string of pearls that hangs down to here Cornelia indicated a point on her person with a proud finger or else a house and lot anywhere in town that I like Which would you take Dominick was saved from the responsibility of stating a preference on this important point by Etienne the waiter presenting his hat to him with the low bow of the well tipped gar on [ ] With a scraping of chair legs they rose and threading their way among the now crowded tables passed out into the wind swept streets Here they separated Cornelia with her armful of wilting flowers going home and Dominick back to the bank He was entering the building when he met Bill Cannon also returning to his office from a restaurant lunch at a small Montgomery Street chop house where every day at one he drank a glass of milk and ate a sandwich The Bonanza King stopped and spoke to the young man his greeting marked by a simple friendliness Their conversation lasted a few minutes and then Dominick entered the bank Two hours later while he was still bending over his books in the hushed seclusion of the closed building Bill Cannon was talking to Berny in the parlor of the Sacramento Street flat This interview was neither so long and on Berny s part did not show the self restraint which had marked the first one The offer of one hundred thousand dollars which the old man made her was refused with more scorn and less courtesy than had been displayed in her manner on the former occasion kin n adj He
