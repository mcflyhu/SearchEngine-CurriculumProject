But when the morning came I could not be sure that Betty was dead They brought me a telegram In wrenching the envelope off I tore the message twice My fingers could hardly piece the signature together I realised at last the Duncombe housemaid s name My mother was sinking she said and we were expected back by the night train The message had been sent an hour after we left home It reached Lowndes Square seven hours before I had come beating at the door That it had lain in the hall forgotten seemed to me hardly to matter now Not even to day could I go home I seemed to see the future If my mother had not died in the night the end would very quickly come There was mercy there As for me I knew I should not die till I was sure that Betty was out of the world As though[Pg ] to our best our only friend I turned to the thought of her physical weakness But I must be sure I rose up out of my bed and Darkness took me in her arms I was ill a long long while Whenever a time came that found me free of fever able to think again what could I think except that even if Betty were dead there were the others The unhappy man had said that always always there were others So I had seen the need wrong The lamp of a young girl s hope held up in her little world to help her to find a mate that light was pale beside the red glare of this fierce demand from men And the people who knew least went on saying it wasn t true And the people who knew most said there are many thousand lost sisters in London Who would help me to find mine or to sleep once more knowing Bettina safely dead Nothing to hope from the foggy self bemused mystic whose face alternated with that of the nurse in and out of my dreaming and my waking [Pg ] Long ago she had turned away from service even from knowledge There was no evil except as a figment of mortal mind Peace peace and this battle nightly at her gate Just once her doors burst open and she was made aware The sound would soon be faint in her ears and then would cease Who else Not her friend the Healer whose way of healing was to look away from the wound Could I trust even Eric to help The man who had set his work before his love who had said If all the people in the house were dying if the house were falling about my ears and I thought I was getting it I d let the house fall and the folks die and go on tracking the Secret home Even if that were not quite seriously meant no more than all the other good men and true would that one leave the lesser task and set himself to cure this cancer at the heart of the world Eric and all the rest this it was that crushed hope out of my heart they all knew And they accepted this thing That was the thought that again and again tore[Pg ] me out of my bed and brought the great Darkness down In the grey intervals I was conscious of Mrs Harborough s being more and more in the room I came to look for her She spoke sometimes of my father She imagined I was like him To think that made her very gentle and I believe brought her a kind of light I wondered about the doctor How had she been brought to have someone tending me who did not call himself a Healer yet who I felt might well have cured any malady but mine She had forbidden the nurse to talk to me about my sister so that I was the more surprised the day Mrs Harborough spoke of Betty of her own accord If you will try to get strong she said I will tell you what has been done to find her And when you are really well I will do all that any one woman can to help So we talked a little just a little now and then about the things I thought of endlessly And not vaguely either She saw how vagueness maddened me We faced things How she had misunderstood[Pg ] my mother That could never be made up now My mother never knew why we were not with her nor even that we were not there Consciousness had never come back to her I heard of all that Eric had done and that his was the last face she knew He had stayed with her all that night to the end There were letters for me from him Soon now I should have my letters He had been many times to ask about me About me What was he doing about But no that was for me alone Up and down the streets I should go looking into the eyes of outcasts under city lamps looking for the eyes I knew Nor could I wait till I was well Night by night I went upon the quest Catching distant glimpses of Bettina in my dreams struggling to reach her for ever losing her in the turmoil of streets and the roar of stations till the thought of Bettina was merged in overmastering terror of the noise and evil which was London The moment I was a little better they tried to get me to sleep without an opiate The doctor made so great a point of this I did all in my[Pg ] power not to disappoint him and for no reason in the world but that something in his voice reminded me of Eric just a little Nobody knew how much of the time behind closed eyes my mind was broad awake Oh the London nights airless endless And the anguish of those haunted hours before dawn My country ears so used to silence or the note of birds strained to interpret London sounds before break of day Hardly any honest individual voices and yet no moment quiet Incessantly the distant rumbling of something I could never tell what It was the roar of London streets by day attenuated held at bay but never conquered the bustle and clang muffled in the huge blanket of the night The strongest impression about it was just of the vague unverifiable thing being there an enemy breathing in the dark Sometimes it started up with a rattle of chains Mail carts said the nurse And that other sound like one s idea of battering rams thundering at fortress walls the nurse would have me believe that to such an accompaniment[Pg ] did milk make entry into London Sometimes the thick air was so sharply torn by horn or pierced by whistle that I would start up in my bed trembling listening till the dying clamour sunk once more to the level of the giant s breathing When I was not delirious the reason I lay still was sometimes half a nightmare reason a feeling that the muffled night sounds were like the bees at home in the rhododendron drumming softly so long as we sat still The moment we rose up the bees rose too with angry commotion ready to fly in our faces and sting Just so with that muted hum of London If I were not very still if I were to rise and venture out all the stinging angry noises would rise too and overwhelm me And out there in the heart of the swarm Bettina Being stung and stung till feeling died wrenching n v wrench China
