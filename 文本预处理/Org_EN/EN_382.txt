Hilary and Peter gondoled to Lord Evelyn Urquhart s residence a rather exquisite little old palace called Ca delle Gemme and were received affectionately by the tall slim dandified looking young old man with his white ringed hands and high sweet voice and courtly manner He had aged since Peter remembered him the slim hands were shakier and the near sighted eyes weaker and the delicate face more deeply lined with the premature lines of dissipation and weak health He put his monocle in his left eye and smiled at Peter with the old charming smile that was like his nephew s and tilted to and fro on his heels Not changed at all as far as I can see he said to Peter with the same mincing finicking pronunciation that had pleased the boy Peter eight years ago Only my sight isn t what it was Are you changed at all Do you still like Bow rose bowls better than anything except Denis Denis is coming here soon you know so I shall be able to discover Oh I beg pardon Mr Peter Margerison Mr Cheriton Mr Cheriton was a dark sturdy young man with an aggressive jaw who bowed without a smile and looked one rather hard in the face Peter was a little frightened of him these curt brisk manners made him nervous always and felt a desire to edge behind Hilary He gathered that Hilary and Cheriton did not very much like one another He knew what that slight nervous contraction of Hilary s forehead meant Dinner was interesting Lord Evelyn told pleasant and funny stories in his high tittering voice addressing himself to all his guests but looking at Peter when he came to his points People usually looked at Peter when they came to the points of their stories Hilary talked a good deal and drank a good deal and ate very little and was obviously on very friendly terms with Lord Evelyn and on no terms at all with Mr Cheriton Cheriton looked a good deal at Peter with very bright and direct eyes and flung into the conversation rather curt and spasmodic utterances in a slightly American accent He seemed a very decided and very much alive young man a little rude thought Peter but possibly that was only his trans Atlantic way if as his voice hinted he came from America Once or twice Peter met the direct and vivid regard fixed upon him and nearly was startled into I beg your pardon for there seemed to him an odd element of accusation in the look But it isn t my fault he told himself reassuringly I ve not done anything I m sure I haven t It s just the way he s made I expect Or else people have done him badly once or twice and he s always thinking it s going to happen again Rough luck on him poor chap After dinner they went into what Lord Evelyn called the saloon Where I keep my especial treasures he remarked to Peter You d like to walk round and look at some of them I expect These bronzes now he indicated two statuettes on brackets by the door Peter looked at them then swiftly up at Lord Evelyn who swayed at his side his glass screwed into one smiling eye Lord Evelyn touched the near statuette with his light unsteady beautifully ringed hand Rather lovely isn t she he said caressing her We found her and the Act on in a dusty hole of a place in a miserable little calle off the Campo delle Beccarie kept by a German Jew Quite a find the old sinner What an extortioner though Eh Margerison How much has the old Schneller got out of my pocket It was your brother who discovered him for me young Peter He took me there and we found the Diana together Like her Giacomo Treviso a pupil of Verrocchio s Heard of him The Act on s not so good now Same man but not so happy He turned the Diana about he posed her for Peter s edification Peter looked from her to the Act on from the Act on to Lord Evelyn s face He opened his lips to say something and closed them on silence He looked past Lord Evelyn to Hilary who stood in the background leaning a little against a chair It seemed to Peter that there was a certain tensity a strain in his face Then Peter met full the bright hard vivid gaze of the alert Cheriton It had an odd expression at this moment unmistakably inimical observantly curious distinctly sardonic A faint ironic smile just touched the corners of his determined mouth Peter returned the look with his puzzled enquiring eyes that sought to understand This much anyhow he seemed to understand his r le was silence If Cheriton didn t speak and Cheriton s expression showed that he knew and if Hilary didn t speak well he Peter couldn t speak either He must acquiesce in what appeared to be a conspiracy to keep this pathetic worn out dilettante in a fool s paradise The pathos of it gripped Peter s heart Lord Evelyn had once known so well What havoc was this that one could apparently make of one s faculties It wasn t only physical semi blindness it was a blindness of the mind a paralysis of the powers of discrimination and appreciation which was pitiful Peter was angry He thought Hilary and Cheriton so abominably unmitigatedly wrong And yet he himself had said If it makes them happy and left that as the indubitable end Ah but one didn t lie to people even for that Peter was brought up sharply as he had often been before against Hilary s strange Hilaryish perverted views of the conduct of life s businesses Then as usual when he should have felt furthest from mirth he abruptly collapsed into sudden helpless laughter Lord Evelyn turned the eye glass on him Eh he queried Why so But never mind you always suffered in that way I remember Get it from your mother I think she did too Never explain jokes they lose so in the telling Now I want to show you something over here Peter crossed the room his laughter dead After all funny wasn t what it really was Mainly it was perplexing Till he could have it out with Hilary he couldn t understand it at all He saw more of Lord Evelyn s treasures and perplexity grew He did not laugh again he was very solemn and very silent and very polite where he could not admire Where he could he did but even here his admiration was weighed down to soberness by the burden of the things beyond the pale Lord Evelyn found him lukewarm changed and dulled from the vivid devotee of old who had coloured up all over his pale face at the sight of a Bow rose bowl He coloured indeed now when Lord Evelyn said Like it coloured and murmured indistinguishable comments into his collar He coloured most when Lord Evelyn said as he frequently did Your brother s find A delicious little man in some sotto portico or other quite an admirable person Eh Margerison Hilary in the background would vaguely assent Peter who looked at him no more felt the indefinable challenge of his tone It meant either I ve as much right to my artistic taste as you have Peter and I m not ashamed of it or Speak out if you want to shatter the illusions that make the happiness of his ridiculous life if not be silent And all the time the vivid stare of Jim Cheriton was turned like a search light on Peter s face and his odd smile grew and grew Cheriton was watching observing taking in something new trying to solve some problem At the end of half an hour Lord Evelyn said Peter Margerison you ve lost some of the religious fervour of your youth The deceitfulness of riches and the cares of this world is that it What s come to you that you re so tepid about this Siena chalice Don t be tepid young Peter it s the symptom of a ruined soul He polished his glass screwed it into his left eye and looked down on Peter with his whimsical kindly scrutiny Peter did not return the look he stood with bent head looking vaguely down at the Sienese chalice That too was one of Hilary s finds Hilary it seemed had approved its seller in an article in the Gem Damme said Lord Evelyn suddenly with unusual explosiveness if I didn t like you better when you were fifteen Now you blas and soulless generation I suppose you want to play bridge Do you play as badly as ever Peter A remarkable player you were I remember quite remarkable Denis always told you so Now Cheriton will tell you so because he s rude Bridge was a relief to Peter though he was still a rather remarkable player He played with Cheriton who was not rude because he was absolutely silent It was an absurd game Cheriton was a brilliant player even when he was only giving half his mind to it as he seemingly was to night Lord Evelyn had been a brilliant player once and was now brilliant with alternations of eccentricity he talked most of the time making the game the centre of his remarks from which he struck out along innumerable paths of irrelevancy The Margerisons too were irrelevant Hilary thought bridge a bore and Peter who thought nothing a bore was always a little alarmed by anything so grown up But to night he didn t much mind what he did so long as he stopped looking at Lord Evelyn s things Peter only wanted to get away he was ashamed and perplexed and sorry and angry and stabbed through with pity He wanted to get out of Lord Evelyn s house out of the range of his kindly whimsical smile and Cheriton s curious hostile stare he wanted to be alone with Hilary and to understand The irony of Cheriton s look increased during bridge it was certainly justified by the abstraction of Peter s play Lord Evelyn laughed at him You need Denis to keep you in order young Peter Lord how frightened you used to be when Denis was stern Smiled and pretended you weren t but I knew He chuckled at the painted ceiling Knew a man at Oxford Peter well never mind that story now you re too young for it Anyhow I make it no trumps At eleven o clock Hilary and Peter went home Lord Evelyn shook hands with Peter rather affectionately and said Come and see me again soon dear boy Lunch with me at Florian s to morrow you and your wealthy friend Busy sight seeing are you How banal of you Morning in the Duomo afternoon on the Lido and the Accademia to fill the spare hours I know the dear old round Never could be worried with it myself too much else to do But one manages to enjoy life even without it so don t overwork And come and see my toys again by daylight and try to enthuse a little more over them next time You re too young to be blas You d better read the Gem to encourage yourself in simple pleasures Good night Good night Margerison He shook hands with them both again possibly to make up for Cheriton who did not shake hands at all but stood with his own in his pockets leaning against the wall his eyes still on Peter s face Queer manners you have dear Jim was what they heard Lord Evelyn say as they stepped into the Ca delle Gemme gondola that was taking them back to the Rio delle Beccarie They swung out into the faintly shining darkness of the water road into which the climbing moon could not look a darkness crossed and flecked by the red gleamings of the few gondola and sandolo lights abroad at this hour in the quiet street They sent their own red path before them as they softly travelled and round it the stars flickered and swam deep down Peter could have sworn he heard their thin tinkling submerged funny song somewhere above or beneath the soft and melodious Ch rie Birri Bim that someone not Lord Evelyn s beautifully trained and taciturn poppe was crooning near at hand The velvet darkness of a bridge drowned the stars for a moment then with a musical abrupt cry of Sta i they swung round a corner into a narrow way that was silver and green in the face of the climbing moon The musically lovely night the peace of the dim water ways the shadowing mystery of the steep shuttered houses with here and there a lit door or window ajar sending a slant of yellow light across the deep green lane full of stars and the moon the faint crooning of music far off made a cool marvel of peace for strung nerves Peter sat by Hilary in silence and no longer wanted to ask questions In the strange enveloping wonder of the night minor wonders died What did it matter anyhow Hilary and Venice Venice and Hilary give them time and one would explain the other It was Hilary who began to talk and he talked about Cheriton his nervous voice pitched on a high note of complaint I do intensely dislike that man The sort of person I ve no use for you know So horribly on the spot such sharp unsoftened manners All the terrible bright braininess of the Yankee combined with the obstreperous energy of the Philistine Briton His mother is a young American about to be married for the third time The sort of exciting career one would expect from a parent of the delightful Jim I cannot imagine why Lord Evelyn who is a person of refinement encourages him Really you know He grew very plaintive over it Peter really did not wonder Peter s subconscious mind registered a dim impression that this was defensive talk to fill the silence Hilary was a nervous person easily agitated Probably the evening had agitated him But he was no good at defence His complaint of Jim Cheriton broke weakly on an unsteady laugh Peter nodded assent and looked up the street of dim water his chin propped in his hands and thought how extraordinarily pleasant was the red light that slanted across the dark water from green doors ajar in steep house walls Hilary tried to light a cigar and flung broken matches into spluttering darkness At last he succeeded and then when he had smoked in silence for two minutes he turned abruptly on Peter and said Well Peter dreamily turning towards him felt the nervous challenge of his tone and read it in his pale tired face Peter pulled himself together and collected his thoughts After all one might as well know Oh well what Yes what about those ghastly statuettes and all the rest of them Why when how and what on earth for Hilary after a moment of silence said with a rather elaborate carelessness I saw you didn t like them At that Peter started a little and the dreaminess of the night fell away from him You saw oh For a moment he couldn t think of anything else to say Then he laughed a little Why yes I imagine you did But what s the object of it all Have you and Cheriton by the way why does he glare at us both so come to the conclusion that it s worth while playing that sort of game If you have I can t tell you how utterly wrong I think you are Make him happy oh I know but what extraordinary cheek on your part I as near as possible gave you away I did really Besides what did he mean by saying you d advised him to buy the things praised them in the Gem and all that You can t have gone so far as that did you After a moment of silence Hilary turned abruptly and looked Peter in the face taking the long cigar out of his mouth and holding it between two white nervous fingers Upon my word said Hilary speaking rather slowly Talk of cheek Do you know what you re accusing me of You and your precious taste Leslie and your other fool patrons seem to have given you a fair opinion of yourself Because you in your omniscience think a thing bad which I which I obviously consider good and have stated so in print you don t so much as deign to argue the question but get upon your pedestal and ask me why I tell lies You think one thing and I think another of course you must know best but I presume I may be allowed to hold my misguided and ill informed opinion without being accused blankly of fraud Upon my word Peter it s time you took to some other line of life I think His high unsteady voice trailed away into silence Peter out of all the dim beauty of the night saw only the pale disturbed frowning face the quivering hand that held the lean cigar All the strangeness and the mystery of the mysterious world were here concentrated Numbly and dully he heard the soft rhythmic splashing of the dipping oar the turning cry of Premi Then sharper Sciar Signori sciar as they nearly jostled another gondola swinging round sharply into a moonless lane of ancient palaces Peter presently said But and there stopped What could he say beyond but Hilary answered him sharply Well and then after another pause Peter pulled himself together gave up trying to thread the maze of his perplexity and said soberly I beg your pardon Hilary I m an ass Hilary let out his breath sharply and resumed his cigar It s possible of course he said more quietly that you may be right and I wrong about the things That s another question altogether I may be a fool I only resent being called a knave Really you know I never meant that Peter hopelessly began to explain And indeed now that Hilary disclaimed it it did seem a far too abominable thing that he had implied He had hurt Hilary he deserved to be kicked His anger with himself rose To hurt anyone was atrocious to hurt Hilary unforgivable He would have done a great deal now to make amends He stammered over it I did think I m afraid that you and Cheriton were doing it to make him happy or something I m awfully sorry I was an ass I ought to have known But it never occurred to me that you didn t kn that you had a different opinion of the things I say Hilary Cheriton knows I saw him know He knew and he was wondering what I was going to say Knew knew knew Hilary nervously exploded There you go again You re intolerable Peter really All the spoiling you ve had has gone to your head I beg your pardon said Peter again I meant Cheriton agreed with me I m sure But Hilary those statuettes you can t really They re mid Victorian and positively offensive His voice rose shrilly They had been so horrible Diana and Act on He couldn t forget them in their podgy sentimentality And and that chalice he shuddered over it and That ll do thanks Hilary broke in You can say at once that you disagree with me about everything I admire and leave it there But if I may ask you don t say so to Lord Evelyn if you can resist the temptation to show me up before him It will only bother and disturb him whichever of us he ends by agreeing with He s shown that he trusts my taste more or less by giving me his paper to edit and I should think we might leave it at that Yes the paper Peter was reminded of it and it became a distracting puzzle Hilary thought Diana and Act on and the Siena chalice good things and Hilary edited an art paper What in the name of all that was horrible did he put in it A light was shed on Signor Leroni who was said the Gem a good dealer in plaques and who was Peter had thought a bare faced purveyor of shams Peter began to question the quality of the osele that Leslie had purchased from Signor Sardi How curious it was and rather tragic too For Hilary like Lord Evelyn had known once Had Hilary too in ruining much else of himself ruined his critical faculties And could one really do that and remain ignorant of the fact Or would one rather have a lurking suspicion and therefore be all the more defiantly corroborative of one s own judgment In either case one was horribly to be pitied but but one shouldn t try to edit art papers And yet this couldn t be conveyed without a lacerating of feelings that was unthinkable There was always this about Hilary one simply couldn t bear to hurt him He was so easily hurt and so often life used him so hardly and he felt it so keenly that it behoved Peter at least to insert as many cushions as possible between him and the sharp edges of circumstance Peter was remorseful He had taken what he should have seen before was an unforgivable line he had failed abominably in comprehension and decent feeling Poor Hilary Peter was moved by the old impulse to be extraordinarily nice to him They turned out of the Rio della Madonnetta into the narrow rio that was the back approach to the Palazzo Amadeo It is a dark little canal a rio of the poor The doors that stood open in the peeling brick walls above the water let out straggling shafts of lamplight and quarrelling voices and singing and the smell of wine The steep house walls leant to meet one another from either side from upper windows the people who hadn t gone to bed talked across a space of barely six feet The gondola crept cautiously under two low bridges then stopped outside the water washed back steps of the Palazzo Amadeo One pleasant thing about Lord Evelyn s exquisitely mannered poppe was that one didn t feel that he was thinking I am not accustomed to taking my master s visitors to such low haunts In the first place he probably was In the second he was not an English flunkey and not a snob He was no more a snob than the Margerisons were or Lord Evelyn himself He deposited them at the Palace back door politely saluted and slipped away down the shadowy water street Hilary and Peter stepped up two water washed steps to the green door and Peggy opened it from within Peggy Peter occasionally wondered when if ever she went to bed was in the hall nursing Illuminato who couldn t sleep a small bundle of scarlet night shirt and round bullet head burrowing under his mother s left arm and staring out from that place of comfort with very bright and wakeful eyes When indeed it might have been asked did any of the Margerison family take their rest No one of them ever felt or expressed any surprise at finding any other awake and active at any hour of the night Peggy looked at her three male infants with her maternal serenity touched with mirth There were nearly always those two elements in Peggy s look a motherly sympathy and desire to cheer and soothe and a glint from some rich and golden store of amusement She patted Peter on the arm softly Was it a nice evening then No not very I think Dear dear You both look so unutterably tired I wonder had you better go to bed quite straight It seemed to be suggested as a last resource of the desperate though the hour was close on midnight And the children have been pillow fighting till Mr Vyvian the creature came down with nothing in particular on to complain to me that he couldn t sleep Sleep you know It wasn t after ten but it seems he had a headache as usual because Mrs Johnson had insisted on going to look at pictures with him and Rhoda and her remarks were such Nervous prostration poor Mr Vyvian So I ve had Illuminato down here with me since then He wants to go to you Peter as usual Peter took the scarlet bundle and it burrowed against his shirt front with a contented sigh Peggy watched the two for a moment then said to the uncle You poor little boy you re tireder than Hilary even You must surely go to bed But isn t Lord Evelyn rather a dear Quite a dear Peter answered her his face bent over the round cropped head Altogether charming and delightful Do you know though I m not really fond of bridge Jig saw is my game and we didn t have it That s why I m tired I expect And because there was a Mr Cheriton who stared and seemed somehow to have taken against us didn t he Hilary Or perhaps it was only his queer manners dear Jim Anyhow he made me feel shy It takes it out of one not being liked Nervous prostration like poor Mr Vyvian So let s go to bed Hilary and leave these two to watch together Give me the froglet She took it from his arms gently and kissed first one then the other Good night little Peter You are a darling entirely and I love you And don t worry not over not being liked or anything else because it surely isn t worth it She was always affectionate and maternal to Peter but to night she was more so than usual Looking at her as she stood in her loose slatternly neglig beneath the extravagantly blazing chandelier the red bundle cuddling a round black head into her neck her grey eyes smiling at him lit with love and laughter and a pity that lay deeper than both Peter was caught into her atmosphere of debonair and tranquil restfulness that said always Take life easy nothing s worth worrying over not problems or poverty or even one s sins How entirely true Nothing was worth worrying over certainly other people s strange points of view weren t It was a gospel of ease and laissez faire well suited to Peter s temperament He smiled at Peggy and Hilary and their son and went up the marble stairs to bed He was haunted till he slept by the memory of Hilary s nervous tired face as he had seen it in the moonlight in the gondola and again in the hall as he said good night Hilary wasn t coming to bed yet He stayed to talk to Peggy If anything could be good for Hilary s moods of depression thought Peter Peggy would How jolly for Hilary to be married to her She was such a refreshment always She was so understanding and was there a lapse somewhere in that very understandingness of her that made it the more restful that made her a relaxation to strained minds To those who were breaking their moral sense over some problem she would return simply There isn t any problem Take things as they come and make the best of them and don t don t worry I m struggling with a temptation to steal a purse Peter imagined himself saying to her What can I do about it And her swift answer came with her indulgent humorous smile Dear little boy if it makes you any happier do it And then she would so well understand the ensuing remorse she would be so sympathetic so wholly dear and comforting She would say anything in the world to help except Put it back Even that she would say if one s own inclinations were tending in that direction But never if they weren t She would never be so hard so unkind That sort of uncongenial admonition might be left to one s confessor wasn t that what confessors were there for But why think of stealing purses so late at night No doubt merely because it was late at night Peter curled himself up and drew the sheet over his ears and sighed sleepily He seemed to hear the rich pleasant echoes of Peggy s best nursery voice far off and Hilary s high plaintive tones rising above it But above both dominant and insistent murmured the lapping voice of the wonderful city at night A faint rhythm of snoring beyond a thin wall somehow suggested Mrs Johnson and Peter laughed into his pillow exquisite adj I was admiring the
