It was late almost dark that evening when Cannon left his office He had sat on after Berny s departure sunk in a reverie which was not compounded of those gentle thoughts that are usually associated with that state of being In the past when he had been struggling up from poverty he had had his fierce fights and his mortifying defeats He had risen from them tougher and more combative than ever filled with the lust of vengeance which in the course of time was assuaged But of late years few and these antagonists of his own measure had had the temerity to cross swords with him Now he had been defied in his stronghold and by the sort of person that he looked upon as a worm in the path the kind of worm a man did not even tread on but simply brushed aside It was incredible in its audacity its bold insolence As he walked down Montgomery Street to the car he pondered on Berny wonderingly and with a sort of begrudging astonished admission of a[ ] courage that he could not but admire What a nerve the woman had to dare to threaten him To threaten Bill Cannon There was something wild uncanny preposterous in it that was almost sublime had the large elemental quality of a lofty indifference to danger that seemed to belong more to heroic legend than to modern life in the West But his admiration was tempered by his alarm at the thought of his daughter s learning of the sordid intrigue The bare idea of Rose s censuring him and he knew she would if she ever learned of his part in the plot was enough to make him decide that some particularly heavy punishment would be meted out to the woman who dared shatter the only ideal of him known to exist But he did not for a moment believe that Berny would tell She was angry and was talking blusteringly as angry women talk He did not know why she was in such a state of ill temper but at this stage of the proceedings he did not bother his head about that For the third time she had refused the money that was the only thing that concerned him If she refused three hundred thousand dollars she would refuse anything It was as much to her as a million would be She would know it was as large a sum as she could expect If that would not buy her nothing would Her threats were nonsense bluff and bluster the important thing was she[ ] had determined for some reason of her own to stick to Dominick Ryan How she had found out about Rose he could not imagine only it was very enraging that she should have done so It was the last and most detestable fact in the whole disagreeable business Brooding on the subject as the car swept him up the hill he decided that she had guessed it She was as sharp as a needle and she had put this and that together the way women do and had guessed the rest Pure ugliness might be actuating her present line of conduct and that state of mind was rarely of long duration The jealous passions of women soon burn themselves out Those shallow vessels could not long contain feelings of such a fiery potency especially when harboring the feeling was so inconvenient and expensive No one knew better than Berny how well worth her while it would be to cultivate a sweet reasonableness This was the only gleam of hope left Her power to endure the present conditions of her life might give out That was all the consolation the Bonanza King could extract from the situation and it did not greatly mitigate his uneasiness and bad humor This latter condition of being had other matter to feed it matter which in the interview of the afternoon had been pushed into the background but which now once again obtruded itself upon his attention It was the first of May By the[ ] morning s mail he had received a letter from Gene announcing with the playful blitheness which marked all the young man s allusions to the transfer of the Santa Trinidad Ranch that the year of probation was up and he would shortly arrive in San Francisco to claim his own Gene s father had read this missive in grim visaged silence The sense of self approval that he might have experienced was not his he only felt that he had been done Two months before thinking that the ranch was slipping too easily from his grasp that he was making too little effort to retain his own he had hired a detective to go to San Luis Obispo and watch the career of Gene for signs of his old waywardness On the thirtieth of April the man had reported that Gene s course had been marked by an abstinence as genuine and complete as the most exacting father could wish The old man crumpled up the letter and threw it into the waste paper basket muttering balefully like a cloud charged with thunder It was not that he wished Gene to drink again it was that he hated most bitterly giving him the finest piece of ranch land in California It was not that he did not wish his son to be prosperous and respectable only he wished that this happy condition had been achieved at some one else s expense His mood was unusually black when he entered the house The servant who came forward to[ ] help him off with his coat knew it the moment he saw the heavy scowling face The piece of intelligence the man had to convey that Mr Gene Cannon had arrived half an hour earlier from San Luis Obispo was not calculated to abate the Bonanza King s irritation He received it with the expressionless grunt he reserved for displeasing information and without further comment or inquiry went up the stairs to his own rooms From these he did not emerge till dinner was announced when he greeted Gene with a bovine glance of inspection and the briefest sentence of welcome Gene however was not at all abashed by any lack of cordiality At the best of times he was not a sensitive person and as this had been his portion since his early manhood he was now used to it Moreover to night he was in high spirits In his year of exile he had learned to love the outdoor life for which he was fitted and had conceived a passionate desire to own the splendid tract of land for which he felt the love and pride of a proprietor Now it was his without let or hindrance He was the owner of a principality the lord of thousands of teeming acres watered by crystal streams and shadowed by ancient oaks He glowed with the joy of possession and if anything was needed to complete his father s discomfiture it was Gene s na ve and bridling triumph Always a loquacious person a stream of talk[ ] flowed from him to which the old man offered no interruption and in which even Rose found it difficult to insert an occasional arresting question Gene had any number of new plans His head was fuller than it had been for years with ideas for the improvement of his land the development of his irrigating system the planting of new orchards the erecting of necessary buildings He used the possessive pronoun continually rolled it unctuously on his tongue with a new rich delight He directed most of his conversation toward Rose but every now and then he turned on his father enthusiastically dilating on a projected improvement certain to increase the ranch s revenues by many thousands per annum The old man listened without speaking his chin on his collar his eyes fixed in a wide dull stare on his happy boy At intervals Gene almost clamoring for a response he emitted one of those inarticulate sounds with which it was his custom to greet information that he did not like or the exact purport of which he did not fathom The only thing which would have sweetened his mood would have been a conversation peaceful and uninterrupted with his daughter He had not seen as much of her as usual during the last few days as she had been confined to her room with a cold This was the first evening she had been at dinner for four days and the old man[ ] had looked forward to one of their slow enjoyable meals together with a long comfortable chat over the black coffee as was their wont Even if Rose did not know of his distractions and schemes she soothed him She never like this chattering jackass from San Luis Obispo and he looked sulkily at his son rubbed him the wrong way And he had hardly had a word with her hardly in fact had heard her voice during the whole meal When it was over and she rose from her seat he asked her to play on the piano in the sitting room near by Give us some music he said I want to hear something pleasant The whole day I ve been listening to jays and knaves and fools and I want to hear something different that doesn t make me mad or make me sick Rose left the room and presently the sound of her playing came softly from the sitting room across the hall Neither of the men spoke for a space and the old man casting a side look at Gene was maliciously gratified by the thought that his son was offended But he had reckoned without his offspring s amiable imperviousness to the brutalities of the parental manner wrought to night to a condition of absolute invulnerability by the young man s unclouded gladness Gene his eyes on his coffee cup was in anything but a state of insulted sullenness as was proved by his[ ] presently looking up and remarking with innocent brightness You didn t expect I d get it did you Pop I knew from the start you were sure I d slip up before the year was out His father eyed him without replying a blank stony stare before which Gene did not show the slightest sign of quailing He went on jubilantly in his high throaty voice I wasn t dead certain of it myself at the start You know it isn t the easiest thing in the world to break off drinking habits that have had you as long as mine had me But when I went down there and lived right on the land when I used to get up in the morning and look out of my window across the hills and see the cattle dotted all over them and the oaks thick and big and bushy and feel the air just as soft as silk I said to myself By gum Gene Cannon you ve got to have this ranch if you die for want of whisky Well you ve got it said his father in a loud pugnacious tone You ve got it haven t you Well I guess I have said Gene his triumph tempered by an air of modesty and I guess I earned it fair I stuck to the bargain and there were times when I can tell you it was a struggle I never once slipped up If you don t believe my word I can bring you men from down there[ ] that know me well and they ll testify that I speak the truth The father raised his eyebrows but said nothing If there was anything further needed to show him what a complete consistent fool his son was it was the young man s evident impression that the Santa Trinidad Ranch had been relinquished upon his own unsupported testimony That was just like Gene For weeks the detective had trotted at his heels an entirely unsuspected shadow It was Rose who really put me up to it he went on She d say to me I could do it I only had to try any one could do anything they really made their minds up to If you said you couldn t do a thing why then you couldn t but if you said you could you got your mind into that attitude and it wasn t hard any more And she was right When I got my mind round to looking at it that way it came quite easily Rose s always right This the first statement of his son s to which the Bonanza King could subscribe did not placate the old man On the contrary it still further inflamed his sense of angry grievance It was bad enough to have Gene stealing the ranch that s all it was but to have him chuckling and grinning over it when that very day Rose s chances of happiness had come to a deadlock was just what you might expect of such a fool Out[ ] of the fullness of the heart the mouth spoke growled rather I was just waiting to hear you give some credit to Rose Here you are talking all through dinner like a megaphone all about yourself and your affairs and not giving a thought to your sister Gene stared at his parent in ingenuous concerned amaze Not a thought to Rose he repeated in a high surprised key Oh yes I have lots of thoughts I was just telling you now about how she braced me up Braced you up Of course she braced you up Hasn t she been doing it all her life But you can t think of anything but yourself Don t you ever look at your sister and think about her and how she feels Yes said Gene giving his head a confirmatory wag I do I do whenever I m in town You see being away on the ranch so much The old man leaned back in his chair emitting a loud interrupting groan Gene stared at him with a dawning uneasiness He had begun to grasp the fact that his father was in a state of mind which had complications that included more than the old familiar contemptuousness of his every day mood He decided to advance more gingerly for even Gene s imperviousness to snubs did not make him proof against the Bonanza King s roused displeasure [ ] I m sure he said mildly no man ever had a more unselfish sister than I have or was more devoted to her than I am Then why the hell said the old man do you go on talking about yourself and your damned concerns bothering the life out of her when she s got troubles of her own The look of foolish amaze on Gene s face deepened into one of genuine concern Troubles of her own What troubles has she got One of the most aggravating features of the situation was that Gene could not be told why Rose was troubled and his father was cross While they were bent under unaccustomed cares he went happy and free with nothing to think of except the ranch he had stolen If he had been any other kind of person he could have been taken into the secret and might have helped them out The Bonanza King had thought of ways in which a young and intelligent man could have been of assistance in inducing Mrs Dominick Ryan to listen to reason Gene if he d had any ability if he d had the brains of a mouse could have made love to her induced her to run away with him and then they could have given her the money and got rid of her without any more fuss He could have been of incalculable value and here he was perfectly useless too much of a fool even to be told the position moved by the[ ] mere gross weight of his stupidity into an outside place of tranquil ignorance That his father could not force him to be a sharer in the family troubles made the old man still more angry and it was a poignant pain to him that the only way he could show his rage was by roaring wrathfully Yes Rose has troubles Of course she has but what have they got to do with you who don t care about a thing but your damned ranch What s the matter with her said Gene roused into active uneasiness and quite oblivious to his father s insults I didn t know anything was wrong She didn t tell me No and she won t said the father And let me tell you if I catch you asking her any questions or giving her any hints that I ve said anything to you you can stay on your ranch and never come back into this house I won t have Rose worried and upset by every fool that comes along Well but how am I to find out what s the matter with her said the altogether baffled brother if you won t tell me and I m not to ask her You needn t find out It s her affair hers and mine Don t you go poking your nose in and trying to find out I don t want you butting into Rose s affairs Just now said Gene in an aggrieved tone you said I didn t take any interest in anything[ ] but my ranch Now when I want to take an interest in Rose you tell me not to butt in I love my sister more than most men and I d like to know if anything s wrong with her She s got a cold said Cannon He spoke sharply and looked at Gene with a sidelong eye full of observant malice The young man gazed back at him confused for a moment half inclined to laugh thinking his father in a sudden unaccustomed playfulness was joking with him Well if it s only a cold he stammered it s nothing to tear up the ground about I thought it was something serious that Rose was unhappy about something But a cold He was interrupted by the sudden appearance of Rose herself her hand drawing back the porti re that veiled the doorway She who knew her father so well had decided that in his present mood it was better to curtail his after dinner chat with Gene Her quick eye took in their two faces and she felt that her brother had probably had a trying half hour I m tired of making music she said I ve played my whole repertoire Now I want Gene to come back into the sitting room with me and tell me about the linen and the furniture I m to send down to the ranch We ll talk it over to night and make a list and arrange for the packing to morrow [ ]The young man rose very glad to go with her still uneasy and puzzled How s your cold Rosey he said I didn t know it was bad or I d have asked more about it Oh it s all right she said carelessly It was never really bad but I stayed in my room for a few days to be safe Her eye caught her father s half shut and full of brooding scorn shot through with a gleam of sardonic humor Gene s half hour must have been even more trying than she had at first thought Come along Gene she said holding out her hand to him we ll leave the old man to his dreams I know he never listened to a note of my music and only told me to play as an excuse to get rid of me She threw a laughing look at her father who answered it with a lazy fond cast of his eye in her direction Taking Gene s hand she drew him into the hall and dropped the porti re The father could hear their voices diminishing and growing muffled as they passed up the hall to the sitting room He sat on as they had left him in his favorite crumpled up attitude After all it was a good thing the boy did not know was of the kind who could not be trusted with any information of importance He did not want Gene or anybody else to interfere He Rose s father and he alone [ ] without any outside assistance would reach up and pick out for her any star that sparkled in the heavens any moon for which she might choose to cry She wanted Dominick Ryan for her husband She should have him and it would be her father who would get him for her He would give her Dominick Ryan as he would a pearl necklace or a new automobile to which she had taken a fancy It whetted the old man s lust of battle that Dominick was so hard to get Sitting fallen together in his chair he thought about new ways of approaching Berny new ways of bribing or wheedling or terrifying her into giving up her husband He was not at the end of his rope yet by any means And it lent an added zest to the game that he had an adversary of so much spirit He was beginning to respect her Even if he had not been fighting for Rose he would have gone
