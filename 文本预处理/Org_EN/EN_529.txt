Meanwhile the months slipped by the south east trade blew itself out the monsoon had begun to breathe and Jerry added to himself six months of time weight stature and thickness of bone An easy time his half year with the blind man had been despite the fact that Nalasu was a rigid disciplinarian who insisted on training Jerry for longer hours day in and day out than falls to the lot of most dogs Never did Jerry receive from him a blow never a harsh word This man who had slain four of the Annos three of them after he had gone blind who had slain still more men in his savage youth never raised his voice in anger to Jerry and ruled him by nothing severer than the gentlest of chidings Mentally the persistent education Jerry received in this period of late puppyhood fixed in him increased brain power for all his life Possibly no dog in all the world had ever been so vocal as he and for three reasons his own intelligence the genius for teaching that was Nalasu s and the long hours devoted to the teaching His shorthand vocabulary for a dog was prodigious Almost might it be said that he and the man could talk by the hour although few and simple were the abstractions they could talk very little of the immediate concrete past and scarcely anything of the immediate concrete future entered into their conversations Jerry could no more tell him of Meringe nor of the Arangi than could he tell him of the great love he had borne Skipper or of his reason for hating Bashti By the same token Nalasu could not tell Jerry of the blood feud with the Annos nor of how he had lost his eyesight Practically all their conversation was confined to the instant present although they could compass a little of the very immediate past Nalasu would give Jerry a series of instructions such as going on a scout by himself to go to the nest then circle about it widely to continue to the other clearing where were the fruit trees to cross the jungle to the main path to proceed down the main path toward the village till he came to the great banyan tree and then to return along the small path to Nalasu and Nalasu s house All of which Jerry would carry out to the letter and arrived back would make report As thus at the nest nothing unusual save that a buzzard was near it in the other clearing three coconuts had fallen to the ground for Jerry could count unerringly up to five between the other clearing and the main path were four pigs along the main path he had passed a dog more than five women and two children and on the small path home he had noted a cockatoo and two boys But he could not tell Nalasu his states of mind and heart that prevented him from being fully contented in his present situation For Nalasu was not a white god but only a mere nigger god And Jerry hated and despised all niggers save for the two exceptions of Lamai and Nalasu He tolerated them and for Nalasu had even developed a placid and sweet affection Love him he did not and could not At the best they were only second rate gods and he could not forget the great white gods such as Skipper and Mister Haggin and of the same breed Derby and Bob They were something else something other something better than all this black savagery in which he lived They were above and beyond in an unattainable paradise which he vividly remembered for which he yearned but to which he did not know the way and which dimly sensing the ending that comes to all things might have passed into the ultimate nothingness which had already overtaken Skipper and the Arangi In vain did the old man play to gain Jerry s heart of love He could not bid against Jerry s many reservations and memories although he did win absolute faithfulness and loyalty Not passionately as he would have fought to the death for Skipper but devotedly would he have fought to the death for Nalasu And the old man never dreamed but what he had won all of Jerry s heart Came the day of the Annos when one of them made the invention which was thick plaited sandals to armour the soles of their feet against the poisoned thorns with which Nalasu had taken three of their lives The day in truth was the night a black night a night so black under a cloud palled sky that a tree trunk could not be seen an eighth of an inch beyond one s nose And the Annos descended on Nalasu s clearing a dozen of them armed with Sniders horse pistols tomahawks and war clubs walking gingerly despite their thick sandals because of fear of the thorns which Nalasu no longer planted Jerry sitting between Nalasu s knees and nodding sleepily gave the first warning to Nalasu who sat outside his door wide eyed ear strung as he had sat through all the nights of the many years He listened still more tensely through long minutes in which he heard nothing at the same time whispering to Jerry for information and commanding him to be soft spoken and Jerry with whuffs and whiffs and all the short hand breath exhalations of speech he had been taught told him that men approached many men more men than five Nalasu reached the bow beside him strung an arrow and waited At last his own ears caught the slightest of rustlings now here now there advancing upon him in the circle of the compass Still speaking for softness he demanded verification from Jerry whose neck hair rose bristling under Nalasu s sensitive fingers and who by this time was reading the night air with his nose as well as his ears And Jerry as softly as Nalasu informed him again that it was men many men more men than five With the patience of age Nalasu sat on without movement until close at hand on the very edge of the jungle sixty feet away he located a particular noise of a particular man He stretched his bow loosed the arrow and was rewarded by a gasp and a groan strangely commingled First he restrained Jerry from retrieving the arrow which he knew had gone home and next he fitted a fresh arrow to the bow string Fifteen minutes of silence passed the blind man as if carven of stone the dog trembling with eagerness under the articulate touch of his fingers obeying the bidding to make no sound For Jerry as well as Nalasu knew that death rustled and lurked in the encircling dark Again came a softness of movement nearer than before but the sped arrow missed They heard its impact against a tree trunk beyond and a confusion of small sounds caused by the target s hasty retreat Next after a time of silence Nalasu told Jerry silently to retrieve the arrow He had been well trained and long trained for with no sound even to Nalasu s ears keener than seeing men s ears he followed the direction of the arrow s impact against the tree and brought the arrow back in his mouth Again Nalasu waited until the rustlings of a fresh drawing in of the circle could be heard whereupon Nalasu Jerry accompanying him picked up all his arrows and moved soundlessly half way around the circle Even as they moved a Snider exploded that was aimed in the general direction of the spot just vacated And the blind man and the dog from midnight to dawn successfully fought off twelve men equipped with the thunder of gunpowder and the wide spreading deep penetrating mushroom bullets of soft lead And the blind man defended himself only with a bow and a hundred arrows He discharged many hundreds of arrows which Jerry retrieved for him and which he discharged over and over But Jerry aided valiantly and well adding to Nalasu s acute hearing his own acuter hearing circling noiselessly about the house and reporting where the attack pressed closest Much of their precious powder the Annos wasted for the affair was like a game of invisible ghosts Never was anything seen save the flashes of the rifles Never did they see Jerry although they became quickly aware of his movements close to them as he searched out the arrows Once as one of them felt for an arrow which had narrowly missed him he encountered Jerry s back with his hand and acknowledged the sharp slash of Jerry s teeth with a wild yell of terror They tried firing at the twang of Nalasu s bowstring but every time Nalasu fired he instantly changed position Several times warned of Jerry s nearness they fired at him and once even was his nose slightly powder burned When day broke in the quick tropic grey that marks the leap from dark to sun the Annos retreated while Nalasu withdrawn from the light into his house still possessed eighty arrows thanks to Jerry The net result to Nalasu was one dead man and no telling how many arrow pricked wounded men who dragged themselves away And half the day Nalasu crouched over Jerry fondling and caressing him for what he had done Then he went abroad Jerry with him and told of the battle Bashti paid him a visit ere the day was done and talked with him earnestly As an old man to an old man I talk was Bashti s beginning I am older than you O Nalasu I have ever been unafraid Yet never have I been braver than you I would that every man of the tribe were as brave as you Yet do you give me great sorrow Of what worth are your courage and cunning when you have no seed to make your courage and cunning live again I am an old man Nalasu began Not so old as I am Bashti interrupted Not too old to marry so that your seed will add strength to the tribe I was married and long married and I fathered three brave sons But they are dead I shall not live so long as you I think of my young days as pleasant dreams remembered after sleep More I think of death and the end Of marriage I think not at all I am too old to marry I am old enough to make ready to die and a great curiousness have I about what will happen to me when I am dead Will I be for ever dead Will I live again in a land of dreams a shadow of a dream myself that will still remember the days when I lived in the warm world the quick juices of hunger in my mouth in the chest of the body of me the love of woman Bashti shrugged his shoulders I too have thought much on the matter he said Yet do I arrive nowhere I do not know You do not know We will not know until we are dead if it happens that we know anything when what we are we no longer are But this we know you and I the tribe lives The tribe never dies Wherefore if there be meaning at all to our living we must make the tribe strong Your work in the tribe is not done You must marry so that your cunning and your courage live after you I have a wife for you nay two wives for your days are short and I shall surely live to see you hang with my fathers from the canoe house ridgepole I will not pay for a wife Nalasu protested I will not pay for any wife I would not pay a stick of tobacco or a cracked coconut for the best woman in Somo Worry not Bashti went on placidly I shall pay you for the price of the wife of the two wives There is Bubu For half a case of tobacco shall I buy her for you She is broad and square round legged broad hipped with generous breasts of richness There is Nena Her father sets a stiff price upon her a whole case of tobacco I will buy her for you as well Your time is short We must hurry I will not marry the old blind man proclaimed hysterically You will I have spoken No I say and say again no no no no Wives are nuisances They are young things and their heads are filled with foolishness Their tongues are loose with idleness of speech I am old I am quiet in my ways the fires of life have departed from me I prefer to sit alone in the dark and think Chattering young things about me with nothing but foam and spume in their heads on their tongues would drive me mad Of a surety they would drive me mad so mad that I will spit into every clam shell make faces at the moon and bite my veins and howl And if you do what of it So long as your seed does not perish I shall pay for the wives to their fathers and send them to you in three days I will have nothing to do with them Nalasu asserted wildly You will Bashti insisted calmly Because if you do not you will have to pay me It will be a sore hard debt I will have every joint of you unhinged so that you will be like a jelly fish like a fat pig with the bones removed and I will then stake you out in the midmost centre of the dog killing ground to swell in pain under the sun And what is left of you I shall fling to the dogs to eat Your seed shall not perish out of Somo I Bashti so tell you In three days I shall send to you your two wives He paused and a long silence fell upon them Well Bashti reiterated It is wives or staking out unhinged in the sun You choose but think well before you choose the unhinging At my age with all the vexations of youngness so far behind me Nalasu complained Choose You will find there is vexation and liveliness and much of it in the centre of the dog killing yard when the sun cooks your sore joints till the grease of the leanness of you bubbles like the tender fat of a cooked sucking pig Then send me the wives Nalasu managed to utter after a long pause But send them in three days not in two nor to morrow It is well Bashti nodded gravely You have lived at all only because of those before you now long in the dark who worked so that the tribe might live and you might come to be You are They paid the price for you It is your debt You came into being with this debt upon you You will pay the debt before you pass out of being It is the law It is very well monsoon n The monsoon rains started
