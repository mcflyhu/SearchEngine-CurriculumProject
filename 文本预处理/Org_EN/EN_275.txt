Next morning Jacob Welse for all of the Company and his millions in mines chopped up the day s supply of firewood lighted a cigar and went down the island in search of Baron Courbertin Frona finished the breakfast dishes hung out the robes to air and fed the dogs Then she took a worn Wordsworth from her clothes bag and out by the bank settled herself comfortably in a seat formed by two uprooted pines But she did no more than open the book for her eyes strayed out and over the Yukon to the eddy below the bluffs and the bend above and the tail of the spit which lay in the midst of the river The rescue and the race were still fresh with her though there were strange lapses here and there of which she remembered little The struggle by the fissure was immeasurable she knew not how long it lasted and the race down Split up to Roubeau Island was a thing of which her reason convinced her but of which she recollected nothing The whim seized her and she followed Corliss through the three days events but she tacitly avoided the figure of another man whom she would not name Something terrible was connected therewith she knew which must be faced sooner or later but she preferred to put that moment away from her She was stiff and sore of mind as well as of body and will and action were for the time being distasteful It was more pleasant even to dwell on Tommy on Tommy of the bitter tongue and craven heart and she made a note that the wife and children in Toronto should not be forgotten when the Northland paid its dividends to the Welse The crackle of a foot on a dead willow twig roused her and her eyes met St Vincent s You have not congratulated me upon my escape he began breezily But you must have been dead tired last night I know I was And you had that hard pull on the river besides He watched her furtively trying to catch some cue as to her attitude and mood You re a heroine that s what you are Frona he began again with exuberance And not only did you save the mail man but by the delay you wrought in the trial you saved me If one more witness had gone on the stand that first day I should have been duly hanged before Gow put in an appearance Fine chap Gow Too bad he s going to die I am glad that I could be of help she replied wondering the while what she could say And of course I am to be congratulated Your trial is hardly a thing for congratulation she spoke up quickly looking him straight in the eyes for the moment I am glad that it came out as it did but surely you cannot expect me to congratulate you O o o with long drawn inflection So that s where it pinches He smiled good humoredly and moved as though to sit down but she made no room for him and he remained standing I can certainly explain If there have been women Frona had been clinching her hand nervously but at the word burst out in laughter Women she queried Women she repeated Do not be ridiculous Gregory After the way you stood by me through the trial he began reproachfully I thought Oh you do not understand she said hopelessly You do not understand Look at me Gregory and see if I can make you understand Your presence is painful to me Your kisses hurt me The memory of them still burns my cheek and my lips feel unclean And why Because of women which you may explain away How little do you understand But shall I tell you Voices of men came to her from down the river bank and the splashing of water She glanced quickly and saw Del Bishop guiding a poling boat against the current and Corliss on the bank bending to the tow rope Shall I tell you why Gregory St Vincent she said again Tell you why your kisses have cheapened me Because you broke the faith of food and blanket Because you broke salt with a man and then watched that man fight unequally for life without lifting your hand Why I had rather you had died in defending him the memory of you would have been good Yes I had rather you had killed him yourself At least it would have shown there was blood in your body So this is what you would call love he began scornfully his fretting fuming devil beginning to rouse A fair weather love truly But Lord how we men learn I had thought you were well lessoned she retorted what of the other women But what do you intend to do he demanded taking no notice I am not an easy man to cross You cannot throw me over with impunity I shall not stand for it I warn you You have dared do things in this country which would blacken you were they known I have ears I have not been asleep You will find it no child s play to explain away things which you may declare most innocent She looked at him with a smile which carried pity in its cold mirth and it goaded him I am down a thing to make a jest upon a thing to pity but I promise you that I can drag you with me My kisses have cheapened you eh Then how must you have felt at Happy Camp on the Dyea Trail As though in answer Corliss swung down upon them with the tow rope Frona beckoned a greeting to him Vance she said the mail carrier has brought important news to father so important that he must go outside He starts this afternoon with Baron Courbertin in La Bijou Will you take me down to Dawson I should like
