To Mrs Philip Harris in the big house looking out across the lake the passing days brought grateful reassurance Betty was safe Miss Stone was well again and the man had not come She breathed more freely as she thought of it The child had told her that she had asked him But she had forgotten to give him her address and it would not do to be mixed up with a person like that free to come and go as he liked He was no doubt a worthy man But Betty was only a child and too easily enamoured of people she liked It was strange how deep an impression the man s words had made on her Athens and Greece filled her waking moments Statues and temples photographs and books of travel loaded the school room shelves The house reeked with Greek learning Poor Miss Stone found herself drifting into archaeology and an exhaustive study of Greek literature Greek life Greek art filled her days The theory of Betty Harris s education had been elaborately worked out by specialists from earliest babyhood Certain studies rigidly prescribed were to be followed whether she liked them or not but outside these lines subjects were to be taken up when she showed an interest in them There could be no question that the time for the study of Greek history and Greek civilisation had come Miss Stone laboured early and late Instruction from the university down the lake was pressed into service But out of it all the child seemed by some kind of precious alchemy to extract only the best the vital heart of it The instructor in Greek marvelled a little She is only a child he reported to the head of the department and the family are American of the newest type you know the Philip Harrises The professor nodded I know hide and hoof a generation back The instructor assented But the child is uncanny She knows more about Greek than Than I do I suppose The professor smiled indulgently She wouldn t have to know much for that It isn t so much what she knows She has a kind of feeling for things I took up a lot of photographs to day some of the later period mixed in and she picked them out as if she had been brought up in Athens The professor looked interested Modern educational methods As much as you like said the instructor But it is something more When I am with the child I am in Athens itself Chicago makes me blink when I come out The professor laughed The next day he made an appointment to go himself to see the child He was a famous epigraphist and an authority in his subject He had spent years in Greece with his nose for the most part held close to bits of parchment and stone When he came away he was laughing softly I am going over for a year he said when he met the instructor that afternoon in the corridor Did you see the little Harris girl asked the instructor The professor paused Yes I saw her How did she strike you She struck me dumb said the professor I listened for the best part of an hour while she expounded things to me asked me questions I couldn t answer mostly He chuckled a little I felt like a fool he added frankly and it felt good The instructor smiled I go through it twice a week The trouble seems to be that she s alive and that she thinks everything Greek is alive too The professor nodded It s never occurred to her it s dead and done with these thousand years and more He gave a little sigh Sometimes I ve wondered myself whether it is quite as dead as it looks to you and me he added You know that grain wheat or something that Blackman took from the Egyptian mummy he brought over last spring Yes he planted it Exactly And all summer he was tending a little patch of something green up there in his back yard as fresh as the eyes of Pharaoh s daughter ever looked on The instructor opened his eyes a little This was a wild flight for the head epigraphist That s the way she made me feel that little Harris girl explained the professor as if my mummy might spring up and blossom any day if I didn t look out The instructor laughed out So you re going over with it A year two years maybe said the professor I want to watch it sprout reassurance n He drew reassurance from the enthusiastic applause Reassurance is especially critical when it comes
