Gerard and Margaret went gaily to Sevenbergen in the first flush of recovered liberty and successful adventure But these soon yielded to sadder thoughts Gerard was an escaped prisoner and liable to be retaken and perhaps punished and therefore he and Margaret would have to part for a time Moreover he had conceived a hatred to his native place Margaret wished him to leave the country for a while but at the thought of his going to Italy her heart fainted Gerard on the contrary was reconciled to leaving Margaret only by his desire to visit Italy and his strong conviction that there he should earn money and reputation and remove every obstacle to their marriage He had already told her all that the demoiselle Van Eyck had said to him He repeated it and reminded Margaret that the gold pieces were only given him to go to Italy with The journey was clearly for Gerard s interest He was a craftsman and an artist lost in this boorish place In Italy they would know how to value him On this ground above all the unselfish girl gave her consent but many tender tears came with it and at that Gerard young and loving as herself cried bitterly with her and often they asked one another what they had done that so many different persons should be their enemies and combine as it seemed to part them They sat hand in hand till midnight now deploring their hard fate now drawing bright and hopeful pictures of the future in the midst of which Margaret s tears would suddenly flow and then poor Gerard s eloquence would die away in a sigh The morning found them resigned to part but neither had the courage to say when and much I doubt whether the hour of parting ever would have struck But about three in the afternoon Giles who had made a circuit of many miles to avoid suspicion rode up to the door They both ran out to him eager with curiosity Brother Gerard cried he in his tremendous tones Kate bids you run for your life They charge you with theft you have given them a handle Think not to explain Hope not for justice in Tergou The parchments you took they are but a blind She hath seen your death in the men s eyes a price is on your head Fly For Margaret s sake and all who love you loiter not life away but fly It was a thunder clap and left two white faces looking at one another and at the terrible messenger Then Giles who had hitherto but uttered by rote what Catherine bade him put in a word of his own All the constables were at our house after you and so was Dirk Brower Kate is wise Gerard Best give ear to her rede and fly Oh yes Gerard cried Margaret wildly Fly on the instant Ah those parchments my mind misgave me why did I let you take them Margaret they are but a blind Giles says so No matter the old caitiff shall never see them again I will not go till I have hidden his treasure where he shall never find it Gerard then after thanking Giles warmly bade him farewell and told him to go back and tell Kate he was gone For I shall be gone ere you reach home said he He then shouted for Martin and told him what had happened and begged him to go a little way towards Tergou and watch the road Ay said Martin and if I see Dirk Brower or any of his men I will shoot an arrow into the oak tree that is in our garden and on that you must run into the forest hard by and meet me at the weird hunter s spring Then I will guide you through the wood Surprise thus provided against Gerard breathed again He went with Margaret and while she watched the oak tree tremblingly fearing every moment to see an arrow strike among the branches Gerard dug a deep hole to bury the parchments in He threw them in one by one They were nearly all charters and records of the burgh but one appeared to be a private deed between Floris Brandt father of Peter and Ghysbrecht Why this is as much yours as his said Gerard I will read this Oh not now Gerard not now cried Margaret Every moment you lose fills me with fear and see large drops of rain are beginning to fall and the clouds lower Gerard yielded to this remonstrance but he put the deed into his bosom and threw the earth in over the others and stamped it down While thus employed there came a flash of lightning followed by a peal of distant thunder and the rain came down heavily Margaret and Gerard ran into the house whither they were speedily followed by Martin The road is clear said he and a heavy storm coming on His words proved true The thunder came nearer and nearer till it crashed overhead the flashes followed one another close like the strokes of a whip and the rain fell in torrents Margaret hid her face not to see the lightning On this Gerard put up the rough shutter and lighted a candle The lovers consulted together and Gerard blessed the storm that gave him a few hours more with Margaret The sun set unperceived and still the thunder pealed and the lightning flashed and the rain poured Supper was set but Gerard and Margaret could not eat the thought that this was the last time they should sup together choked them The storm lulled a little Peter retired to rest But Gerard was to go at peep of day and neither he nor Margaret could afford to lose an hour in sleep Martin sat a while too for he was fitting a new string to his bow a matter in which he was very nice The lovers murmured their sorrows and their love beside him Suddenly the old man held up his hand to them to be silent They were quiet and listened and heard nothing But the next moment a footstep crackled faintly upon the autumn leaves that lay strewn in the garden at the back door of the house To those who had nothing to fear such a step would have said nothing but to those who had enemies it was terrible For it was a foot trying to be noiseless Martin fitted an arrow to his string and hastily blew out the candle At this moment to their horror they heard more than one footstep approach the other door of the cottage not quite so noiselessly as the other but very stealthily and then a dead pause Their blood froze in their veins Oh Kate oh Kate You said fly on the instant And Margaret moaned and wrung her hands in anguish and terror and wild remorse for having kept Gerard Hush girl said Martin in a stern whisper A
