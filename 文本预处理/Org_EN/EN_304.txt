There was a man waiting us in Prestongrange s study whom I distasted at the first look as we distaste a ferret or an earwig He was bitter ugly but seemed very much of a gentleman had still manners but capable of sudden leaps and violences and a small voice which could ring out shrill and dangerous when he so desired The Advocate presented us in a familiar friendly way Here Fraser said he here is Mr Balfour whom we talked about Mr David this is Mr Symon Fraser whom we used to call by another title but that is an old song Mr Fraser has an errand to you With that he stepped aside to his book shelves and made believe to consult a quarto volume in the far end I was thus left in a sense alone with perhaps the last person in the world I had expected There was no doubt upon the terms of introduction this could be no other than the forfeited Master of Lovat and chief of the great clan Fraser I knew he had led his men in [pg ]the Rebellion I knew his father s head my old lord s that grey fox of the mountains to have fallen on the block for that offence the lands of the family to have been seized and their nobility attainted I could not conceive what he should be doing in Grant s house I could not conceive that he had been called to the bar had eaten all his principles and was now currying favour with the Government even to the extent of acting Advocate Depute in the Appin murder Well Mr Balfour said he what is all this I hear of ye It would not become me to prejudge said I but if the Advocate was your authority he is fully possessed of my opinions I may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case he went on I am to appear under Prestongrange and from my study of the precognitions I can assure you your opinions are erroneous The guilt of Breck is manifest and your testimony in which you admit you saw him on the hill at the very moment will certify his hanging It will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him I observed And for other matters I very willingly leave you to your own impressions The Duke has been informed he went on I have just come from his Grace and he expressed himself before me with an honest freedom like the great nobleman he is He spoke of you by name Mr Balfour [pg ]and declared his gratitude beforehand in case you would be led by those who understand your own interests and those of the country so much better than yourself Gratitude is no empty expression in that mouth experto crede I daresay you know something of my name and clan and the damnable example and lamented end of my late father to say nothing of my own errata Well I have made my peace with that good Duke he has intervened for me with our friend Prestongrange and here I am with my foot in the stirrup again and some of the responsibility shared into my hand of prosecuting King George s enemies and avenging the late daring and barefaced insult to his Majesty Doubtless a proud position for your father s son says I He wagged his bald eyebrows at me You are pleased to make experiments in the ironical I think said he But I am here upon duty I am here to discharge my errand in good faith it is in vain you think to divert me And let me tell you for a young fellow of spirit and ambition like yourself a good shove in the beginning will do more than ten years drudgery The shove is now at your command choose what you will to be advanced in the Duke will watch upon you with the affectionate disposition of a father I am thinking that I lack the docility of the son says I And do you really suppose sir that the whole policy [pg ]of this country is to be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an ill mannered colt of a boy he cried This has been made a test case all who would prosper in the future must put a shoulder to the wheel Look at me Do you suppose it is for my pleasure that I put myself in the highly invidious position of prosecuting a man that I have drawn the sword alongside of The choice is not left me But I think sir that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in with that unnatural rebellion I remarked My case is happily otherwise I am a true man and can look either the Duke or King George in the face without concern Is it so the wind sits says he I protest you are fallen in the worst sort of error Prestongrange has been hitherto so civil he tells me as not to combat your allegations but you must not think they are not looked upon with strong suspicion You say you are innocent My dear sir the facts declare you guilty I was waiting for you there said I The evidence of Mungo Campbell your flight after the completion of the murder your long course of secresy my good young man said Mr Symon here is enough evidence to hang a bullock let be a David Balfour I shall be upon that trial my voice shall be raised I shall then speak much otherwise from what I do to day and far less to your gratification little as you like it now Ah you look white cries he I have [pg ]found the key of your impudent heart You look pale your eyes waver Mr David You see the grave and the gallows nearer by than you had fancied I own to a natural weakness said I I think no shame for that Shame I was going on Shame waits for you on the gibbet he broke in Where I shall but be even d with my lord your father said I Aha but not so he cried and you do not yet see to the bottom of this business My father suffered in a great cause and for dealing in the affairs of kings You are to hang for a dirty murder about boddle pieces Your personal part in it the treacherous one of holding the poor wretch in talk your accomplices a pack of ragged Highland gillies And it can be shown my great Mr Balfour it can be shown and it will be shown trust me that has a finger in the pie it can be shown and shall be shown that you were paid to do it I think I can see the looks go round the court when I adduce my evidence and it shall appear that you a young man of education let yourself be corrupted to this shocking act for a suit of cast clothes a bottle of Highland spirits and three and fivepence halfpenny in copper money There was a touch of the truth in these words that knocked me like a blow clothes a bottle of usquebaugh and three and fivepence halfpenny in change [pg ]made up indeed the most of what Alan and I had carried from Aucharn and I saw that some of James s people had been blabbing in their dungeons You see I know more than you fancied he resumed in triumph And as for giving it this turn great Mr David you must not suppose the Government of Great Britain and Ireland will ever be stuck for want of evidence We have men here in prison who will swear out their lives as we direct them as I direct if you prefer the phrase So now you are to guess your part of glory if you choose to die On the one hand life wine women and a duke to be your hand gun on the other a rope to your craig and a gibbet to clatter your bones on and the lousiest lowest story to hand down to your namesakes in the future that was ever told about a hired assassin And see here he cried with a formidable shrill voice see this paper that I pull out of my pocket Look at the name there it is the name of the great David I believe the ink scarce dry yet Can you guess its nature It is the warrant for your arrest which I have but to touch this bell beside me to have executed on the spot Once in the Tolbooth upon this paper may God help you for the die is cast I must never deny that I was greatly horrified by so much baseness and much unmanned by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger Mr Symon had already gloried in the changes of my hue I make no doubt I [pg ]was now no ruddier than my shirt my speech besides trembled There is a gentleman in this room cried I I appeal to him I put my life and credit in his hands Prestongrange shut his book with a snap I told you so Symon said he you have played your hand for all it was worth and you have lost Mr David he went on I wish you to believe it was by no choice of mine you were subjected to this proof I wish you could understand how glad I am you should come forth from it with so much credit You may not quite see how but it is a little of a service to myself For had our friend here been more successful than I was last night it might have appeared that he was a better judge of men than I it might have appeared we were altogether in the wrong situations Mr Symon and myself And I know our friend Symon to be ambitious says he striking lightly on Fraser s shoulder As for this stage play it is over my sentiments are very much engaged in your behalf and whatever issue we can find to this unfortunate affair I shall make it my business to see it is adopted with tenderness to you These were very good words and I could see besides that there was little love and perhaps a spice of genuine ill will between those two who were opposed to me For all that it was unmistakable this interview had been designed perhaps rehearsed with the consent of [pg ]both it was plain my adversaries were in earnest to try me by all methods and now persuasion flattery and menaces having been tried in vain I could not but wonder what would be their next expedient My eyes besides were still troubled and my knees loose under me with the distress of the late ordeal and I could do no more than stammer the same form of words I put my life and credit in your hands Well well says he we must try to save them And in the meanwhile let us return to gentler methods You must not bear any grudge upon my friend Mr Symon who did but speak by his brief And even if you did conceive some malice against myself who stood by and seemed rather to hold a candle I must not let that extend to innocent members of my family These are greatly engaged to see more of you and I cannot consent to have my young women folk disappointed To morrow they will be going to Hope Park where I think it very proper you should make your bow Call for me first when I may possibly have something for your private hearing then you shall be turned abroad again under the conduct of my misses and until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy I had done better to have instantly refused but in truth I was beside the power of reasoning did as I was bid took my leave I know not how and when I was forth again in the close and the door had shut behind me was glad to lean on a house wall and wipe my face [pg ]That horrid apparition as I may call it of Mr Symon rang in my memory as a sudden noise rings after it is over on the ear Tales of the man s father of his falseness of his manifold perpetual treacheries rose before me from all that I had heard and read and joined on with what I had just experienced of himself Each time it occurred to me the ingenious foulness of that calumny he had proposed to nail upon my character startled me afresh The case of the man upon the gibbet by Leith Walk appeared scarce distinguishable from that I was now to consider as my own To rob a child of so little more than nothing was certainly a paltry enterprise for two grown men but my own tale as it was to be represented in a court by Symon Fraser appeared a fair second in every possible point of view of sordidness and cowardice The voices of two of Prestongrange s liveried men upon his doorstep recalled me to myself Ha e said the one this billet as fast as ye can link to the captain Is that for the cateran back again asked the other It would seem sae returned the first Him and Symon are seeking him I think Prestongrange is gane gyte says the second He ll have James More in bed with him next Weel it s neither your affair nor mine s says the first [pg ]And they parted the one upon his errand and the other back into the house This looked as ill as possible I was scarce gone and they were sending already for James More to whom I thought Mr Symon must have pointed when he spoke of men in prison and ready to redeem their lives by all extremities My scalp curdled among my hair and the next moment the blood leaped in me to remember Catriona Poor lass her father stood to be hanged for pretty indefensible misconduct What was yet more unpalatable it now seemed he was
