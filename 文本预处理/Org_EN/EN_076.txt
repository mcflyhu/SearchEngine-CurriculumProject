There was another member of Farmer Green s flock besides Henrietta Hen that was proud Nobody needed to look twice at the Rooster to tell that he had an excellent opinion of himself He had a way of walking about the farmyard that said quite plainly that he believed himself to be a person of great importance And it was true that things went according to his ideas among the flock He was always spoken of as the Rooster For although there were other roosters in the flock they were both younger and smaller than he and he would never permit anybody to call them in his hearing anything but cockerels These cockerels usually took great pains to keep out of the Rooster s way If they were careless and he caught them napping he was more than likely to make matters unpleasant for them He knew how to make their feathers fly Now Henrietta Hen thought that the Rooster behaved in a most silly fashion She said it pained her to see him prancing about with his two long arched tail feathers nodding as he walked The truth was Henrietta could not endure it to have any one more elegantly dressed than she And there was no denying that the Rooster s finery outshone everybody else s Why he wore a comb on his head that was even bigger than Henrietta s And he had spurs too for his legs But what Henrietta Hen disliked most about the Rooster was the way he crowed each morning It wasn t so much the kind of crowing that he indulged in it was rather the early hour he chose for it that annoyed Henrietta He always began his Cockle doodle doo while it was yet dark Then everybody in the henhouse had to wake up whether he wanted to or not And Henrietta Hen did wish the Rooster would keep still at least till daylight came She often remarked that it was perfectly ridiculous for any one from a fine family as she was to get up at such an unearthly hour She said it was a wonder she kept her good looks just on account of the Rooster s crowing Why don t you ask him to wait until it s light before he begins to crow Polly Plymouth Rock asked Henrietta one day I ll do it cried Henrietta Right then she called to one of the cockerels who was near by Just skip across the yard and ask the Rooster she began The cockerel broke right in upon her message Oh I can t do that he exclaimed I ve never gone up to the Rooster and spoken to him If I did he d be sure to fight me Just tell him that I sent you said Henrietta And she made the cockerel listen to her message But he wouldn t be persuaded He told Henrietta that the Rooster would be sure to jump at him the moment he opened his mouth Besides he added it wouldn t do any good anyhow The Rooster can t wait until after daylight before he begins to crow He can t eh Henrietta Hen spoke up somewhat sharply I d like to know[Pg ] the reason why And fixing her gaze sternly upon the Rooster she marched straight across the farmyard towards him to find out spoke n v speak They sourced the spoke nuts from our company The spokes of a wheel are the bars that connect the outer ring to the centre prancing v prance The lead singer was prancing around with the microphone The King lifted Gretel on to his prancing horse and they rode to his palace perfectly adv The witnesses were each perfectly certain of what they said Everything that we re doing is all perfectly above board
