During the first week of Peter Margerison s first term at school Urquhart suddenly stepped a radiant figure on the heroic scale out of the kaleidoscopic maze of bemusing lights and colours that was Peter s vision of his new life Peter seeing Urquhart in authority on the football field asked Who is it and was told Urquhart of course with the implication Who else could it be Oh Peter said and blushed Then he was told Standing right in Urquhart s way like that Urquhart doesn t want to be stared at by all the silly little kids in the lower fourth But Urquhart was as a matter of fact probably used to it So that was Urquhart Peter Margerison hugged secretly his two pieces of knowledge so secret they were and so enormous that he swelled visibly with them there seemed some danger that they might even burst him That great man was Urquhart Urquhart was that great man Put so the two pieces of knowledge may seem to have a certain similarity there was in effect a delicate discrimination between them If not wholly distinct one from the other they were anyhow two separate aspects of the same startling and rather magnificent fact Then there was another aspect did Urquhart know that he Margerison was in fact Margerison He showed no sign of such knowledge but then it was naturally not part of his business to concern himself with silly little kids in the lower fourth Peter never expected it But a few days after that Peter came into the lavatories and found Urquhart there and Urquhart looked round and said I say you Margerison Just cut down to the field and bring my cap You ll find it by the far goal Smithson s ground You can bring it to the lavatories and hang it on my peg Cut along quick or you ll be late Peter cut along quick and found the velvet tasselled thing and brought it and hung it up with the care due to a thing so precious as a fifteen cap The school bell had clanged while he was down on the field and he was late and had lines That didn t matter The thing that had emerged was Urquhart knew he was Margerison After that Urquhart did not have occasion to honour Margerison with his notice for some weeks It was of course a disaster of Peter s that brought them into personal relations Throughout his life Peter s relations were apt to be based on some misfortune or other he always had such bad luck Vainly on Litany Sundays he put up his petition to be delivered from lightning and tempest from plague pestilence and famine from battle and murder and from sudden death Disasters seemed to crowd the roads on which he walked so frequent were they and so tragic that life could scarcely be lived in sober earnest it was for Peter the comedian a tragi comic farce Circumstances provided the tragedy and temperament the farce Anyhow one day Peter tumbled on to the point of his right shoulder and lay on his face his arm crooked curiously at his side remarking that he didn t think he was hurt only his arm felt funny and he didn t think he would move it just yet People pressed about him suggested carrying him off the field asked if he thought it was broken asked him how he felt now asked him all manner of things none of which Peter felt competent to answer His only remark delivered in a rather weak and quavering voice was to the effect that he would walk directly only he would like to stay where he was a little longer please He said it very politely It was characteristic of Peter Margerison that misfortune always made him very polite and pleasant in his manners as if he was saying I am sorry to be so tiresome and feeble do go on with your own businesses you more fortunate and capable people and never mind me As they stood in uncertainty about him someone said There s Urquhart coming and Urquhart came He had been playing on another ground He said What is it and they told him it was Margerison his arm or his shoulder or something and he didn t want to be moved Urquhart pushed through the crowd that made way for him and bent over Margerison and felt his arm from the shoulder to the wrist and Margerison bit at the short grass that was against his face That s all right said Urquhart I wanted to see if it was sprained or broken anywhere It s not it s just a put out shoulder I did that once and they put it in on the field it was quite easy It ought to be done at once before it gets stiff He turned Peter over on his back and they saw that he was pale and his forehead was muddy where it had pressed on the ground and wet where perspiration stood on it Urquhart was unlacing his own boot I m going to haul it in for you he told Peter It s quite easy It ll hurt a bit of course but less now than if it s left It ll slip in quite easily because you haven t much muscle he added looking at the frail thin crooked arm Then he put his stockinged foot beneath Peter s arm pit and took the arm by the wrist and straightened it out The other thin arm was thrown over Peter s pale face and working mouth The muddy forehead could be seen getting visibly wetter Urquhart threw himself back and pulled with a long and strong pull Sharp gasps came from beneath the flung up left arm through teeth that were clenched over a white jersey sleeve The thin legs writhed a little Urquhart desisted breathing deeply Sorry he said one more ll do it The one more was longer and stronger and turned the gasps into semi groans But as Urquhart had predicted it did it There said Urquhart resting and looking pleased as he always did when he had accomplished something neatly Heard the click didn t you It s in all right Sorry to hurt you Margerison you were jolly sporting though Now I m going to tie it up before we go in or it ll be out again So he tied Peter s arm to Peter s body with his neck scarf Then he took up the small light figure in his arms and carried it from the field Hurt much now he asked and Peter shook an untruthful head and grinned an untruthful and painful grin Urquhart was being so inordinately decent to him and he felt even in his pain so extremely flattered and exalted by such decency that not for the world would he have revealed the fact that there had been a second faint click while his arm was being bound to his side and an excruciating jar that made him suspect the abominable thing to be out again He didn t know how the mechanism worked but he was sure that the thing Urquhart had with such labour hauled in had slipped out and was disporting itself at large in unlawful territory He said nothing a little because he really didn t think he could quite make up his mind to another long and strong pull but chiefly because of Urquhart and his immense decency Success was Urquhart s r le one did not willingly imagine him failing If heroes fail one must not let them know it Peter shut his eyes and through his rather sick vision of trespassing rabbits popping in and out through holes in a fence knew that Urquhart s arms were carrying him very strongly and easily and gently He hoped he wasn t too heavy He would have said that he could walk only he was rather afraid that if he said anything he might be sick Besides he didn t really want to walk his shoulder was hurting him very much He was so white about the cheeks and lips that Urquhart thought he had fainted After a little while Urquhart was justified in his supposition it was characteristic of Peter to convert as promptly as was feasible any slight error of Urquhart s into truth So Peter knew nothing when Urquhart carried him indoors and delivered him into other hands He opened his eyes next on the doctor who was untying his arm and cutting his sleeve and saying cheerfully All right young man all right The next thing he said was I was told it had been put in Yes said Peter languidly But it came out again I think So it seems Didn t they discover that down there Peter moved his head limply meaning No But you did did you Well why didn t you say so Didn t want to have it hauled at again I suppose Well we ll have it in directly You won t feel it much So the business was gone through again and this time Peter not only half but quite groaned because it didn t matter now When the thing was done and Peter rigid and swathed in bed the doctor was recalled from the door by a faint voice saying Will you please not tell anyone it came out again Why not The doctor was puzzled Don t know said Peter after finding that he couldn t think of a reason But then he gave the true one Urquhart thought he d got it in all right that s all Oh The doctor was puzzled still But that s Urquhart s business not yours It wasn t your fault you know Please said Peter from the bed Do you mind The doctor looked and saw feverish blue lamps alight in a pale face and soothingly said he did not mind Your shoulder no one else s isn t it he admitted Now you d better go to sleep you ll be all right directly if you re careful not to move it or lie on it or anything Peter said he would be careful He didn t at all want to move it or lie on it or anything He lay and had waking visions of the popping rabbits But they might pop as they liked Peter hid a better thing in his inmost soul Urquhart had said Sorry to hurt you Margerison You were jolly sporting though In the night it seemed incredible that Urquhart had stooped from Valhalla thus far that Urquhart had pulled in his arm with his own hands and called him sporting to his face The words and the echo of the soft pleasant casual voice with its unemphasised intonations spread lifting wings for him and bore him above the aching pain that stayed with him through the night Next morning when Peter was wishing that the crumbs of breakfast that got between one s back and one s pyjamas were less sharp cornered and wondering why a dislocated shoulder should give one an aching bar of pain across the forehead and feeling very sad because a letter from home had just informed him that his favourite guinea pig had been trodden on by the gardener Urquhart came to see him Urquhart said Hullo Margerison How are you this morning and Peter said he was very nearly all right now thanks very much He added Thanks awfully Urquhart for putting it in and seeing after me and everything Oh that s all right Urquhart s smile had the same pleasant quality as his voice He had never smiled at Peter before Peter lay and looked at him the blue lamps very bright in his pale face and thought what a jolly voice and face Urquhart had Urquhart stood by the bed his hands in his pockets and looked rather pleasantly down at the thin childish figure in pink striped pyjamas Peter was fourteen and looked less being delicate to frailness Urquhart had been rather shocked by his extreme lightness He had also been pleased by his pluck hence the pleasant expression of his eyes He was a little touched too by the unmistakable admiration in the over bright blue regard Urquhart was not unused to admiration but here was something very whole hearted and rather pleasing Margerison seemed rather a nice little kid Then quite suddenly and still in his pleasant soft casual tones Urquhart dragged Peter s immense secret into the light of day How are your people he said Peter stammered that they were quite well Of course Urquhart went on I don t remember your mother I was only a baby when my father died But I ve always heard a lot about her Is she She s dead you know broke in Peter hastily lest Urquhart should make a mistake embarrassing to himself A long time ago he added again anxious to save embarrassment Yes oh yes Urquhart from his manner might or might not have known I live with my uncle Peter further told him thus delicately and unobstrusively supplying the information that Mr Margerison too was dead He omitted to mention the date of this bereavement having always a delicate sense of what did and did not concern his hearers The decease of the lady who had for a brief period been Lady Hugh Urquhart might be supposed to be of a certain interest to her stepson that of her second husband was a private family affair of the Margerisons The Urquhart Margerison connection which may possibly appear complicated was really very simple and also of exceedingly little importance to anyone but Peter but in case anyone feels a desire to have these things elucidated it may here be mentioned that Peter s mother had made two marriages the first being with Urquhart s father Urquhart being already in existence at the time the second with Mr Margerison a clergyman who was also already father of one son and became Peter s father later Put so it sounds a little difficult chiefly because they were all married so frequently and so rapidly but really is simplicity itself I live with my uncle too Urquhart said and the fact formed a shadowy bond But Peter s tone had struck a note of flatness that faintly indicated a lack of enthusiasm as to the m nage This note was to Peter s delicately attuned ears absent from Urquhart s voice Peter wondered if Lord Hugh s brother supposing it to be a paternal uncle resembled Lord Hugh To resemble Lord Hugh Peter had always understood till three years ago when his mother had fallen into silence on that and all other topics was to be of a charm One spoke of it with a faint sigh And yet of a charm that somehow had lacked something the intuitive Peter had divined perhaps it had been too splendid too fortunate for a lady who had loved all small weak unlucky things Anyhow not long after Lord Hugh s death he was killed out hunting she had married Mr Margerison the poorest clergyman she could find and the most devoted to the tending of the unprosperous Peter remembered her compassionate delicate lovely full of laughter with something in the dance of her vivid dark blue eyes that hinted at radiant and sad memories She had loved Lord Hugh for a glorious and brief space of time The love had perhaps descended a hereditary bequest with the deep blue eyes to her son Peter would have understood the love the thing he would not have understood was the feeling that had flung her on the tide of reaction at Mr Margerison s feet Mr Margerison was a hard liver and a tremendous giver Both these things had come to mean a great deal to Sylvia Urquhart much more than they had meant to the girl Sylvia Hope And hence Peter who lay and looked at Lord Hugh Urquhart s son with wide bright eyes With just such eyes only holding let us hope an adoration more masked Sylvia Hope had long ago looked at Lord Hugh seeing him beautiful delicately featured pale and fair of skin built with a strong fineness and smiling with pleasant eyes Lord Hugh s beauty of person and charm of manner had possibly not certainly meant more to Sylvia Hope than his son s meant to her son and his prowess at football if he had any had almost certainly meant less But apart from the glamour of physical skill and strength and the official glory of captainship the same charm worked on mother and son The soft quick unemphasised voice with the break of a laugh in it had precisely the same disturbing effect on both Well Urquhart was saying when will they let you play again You must buck up and get all right quickly I shouldn t wonder if you made a pretty decent three quarter sometime You ought to use your arm as soon as you can you know or it gets stiff and then you can t and that s an awful bore Hurt like anything when I hauled it in didn t it But it was much better to do it at once Oh much Peter agreed How does it feel now Oh all right I don t feel it much I say do you think I ought to use it at once in case it gets stiff Peter s eyes were a little anxious he didn t much want to use it at once But Urquhart opined that this would be over great haste He departed and his last words were You must come to breakfast with me when you re up again Peter lay glorified and thought it all over Urquhart knew then he had known from the first He had known when he said I say you Margerison just cut down to the field Not for a moment did it seem at all strange to Peter that Urquhart should have had this knowledge and given no sign till now What after all was it to a hero that the family circle of an obscure individual such as he should have momentarily intersected the hero s own orbit School has this distinction families take a back place one is judged on one s own individual merits Peter would much rather think that Urquhart had come to see him because he had put his arm out and Urquhart had put it in really though only temporarily in than because his mother had once been Urquhart s stepmother Peter s arm did not recover so soon as Urquhart s sanguineness had predicted Perhaps he began taking precautions against stiffness too soon anyhow he did not that term make a decent three quarter or any sort of a three quarter at all It always took Peter a long time to get well of things he was easy to break and hard to mend made in Germany as he was frequently told So cheaply made was he that he could perform nothing Defeated dreams lived in his eyes but to light them there burned perpetually the blue and luminous lamps of undefeated mirth and also an immense friendliness for life and mankind and the delightful world Like the young knight Agenore Peter the unlucky was of a mind having no limits of hope Over the blue and friendly eyes that lit the small pale face the half wistful brows were cocked with a kind of whimsical and gentle humour the same humour that twitched constantly at the corners of his wide and flexible mouth Peter was not a beautiful person but one liked somehow to look at him and to meet his half enquiring half amused wholly friendly and sympathetic regard By the end of his first term at school he found himself unaccountably popular Already he was called Margery and seldom seen by himself He enjoyed life because he liked people and they liked him and things in general were rather jolly and very funny even with a dislocated shoulder Also the great Urquhart would when he remembered take a little notice of Peter enough to inflate the young gentleman s spirit like a blown out balloon and send him soaring skywards to float gently down again at his leisure Towards the end of the term Peter s half brother Hilary came to visit him Hilary was tall and slim and dark and rather beautiful and he lived abroad and painted and he told Peter that he was going to be married to a woman called Peggy Callaghan Peter who had always admired Hilary from afar was rather sorry The woman Peggy Callaghan would he vaguely believed come between Hilary and his family and already there were more than enough of such obstacles to intercourse But at tea time he saw the woman and she was large and fair and laughing and called him in her rich amused voice little brother dear and he did not mind at all but liked her and her laugh and her mirthful lazy eyes Peter was a large minded person he did not mind that Hilary wore no collar and a floppy tie He did not mind this even when they met Urquhart in the street Peter whispered as he passed That s Urquhart and Hilary suddenly stopped and held out his hand and said pleasantly I am glad to meet you Peter blushed at that naturally for Hilary s cheek not for his tie and hoped that Urquhart wasn t much offended but that he understood what half brothers who lived abroad and painted were and didn t think it was Peter s fault Urquhart shook hands quite pleasantly and when Hilary added We shared a stepmother you and I I m Peter s half brother you know he amiably agreed Peter hoped he didn t think that the Urquhart Margerison connection was being strained beyond due bounds Hilary said further You ve been very good to my young brother I know and it was characteristic of Peter that even while he listened to this embarrassing remark he was free enough from self consciousness to be thinking with a keen though undefined pleasure how extraordinarily nice to look at both Hilary and Urquhart in their different ways were Peter s love of the beautiful matured with his growth but in intensity it could scarcely grow Urquhart was saying something about bad luck and shoulders it was decent of Urquhart to say that In fact things were going really well till Hilary after saying Good bye glad to have met you added to it the afterthought You must come and stay at my uncle s place in Sussex some time Mustn t he Peter At the same time fitting accompaniment to the over bold words Peter saw a half crown a round solid terrible half crown pressed into Urquhart s unsuspecting hand Oh horror Which was the worse the invitation or the half crown Peter could never determine Which was the more flagrant indecency that he young Margerison of the lower fourth should without any encouragement whatever have asked Urquhart of the sixth captain of the fifteen head of his house to come and stay with him or that his near relative should have pressed half a crown into the great Urquhart s hand as if he expected him to go forthwith to the tuck shop at the corner and buy tarts Peter wriggled scarlet from his collar to his hair Urquhart was a polite person He took the half crown He murmured something about being very glad He even smiled his pleasant smile And Peter entirely unexpectedly to himself did what he always did in the crises of his singularly disastrous life he exploded into a giggle So some years later he laughed helplessly and suddenly standing among the broken fragments of his social reputation and his professional career He could not help it When the worst had happened there was nothing else one could do One laughed from a sheer sense of the completeness of the disaster Peter had a funny extremely amused laugh hardly the laugh of a prosperous person rather that of the unhorsed knight who acknowledges the utterness of his defeat and finds humour in the very fact It was as if misfortune and this misfortune of the half crown and the invitation is not to be under estimated sharpened all the faculties never blunt by which he apprehended humour So he looked from Hilary to Urquhart and mentally from both to his cowering self and exploded Urquhart had passed on Hilary said What s the matter with you and Peter recovered himself and said Nothing He might have cried with Miss Evelina Anvill Oh my dear sir I am shocked to death He did not He did not even say Why did you stamp us like that He would not for the world have hurt Hilary s feelings and vaguely he knew that this splendid unusual half brother of his was in some ways a sensitive person Hilary said The Urquharts ought to invite you to stay The connection is really close I believe your mother was devoted to that boy as a baby You d like to go and stay there wouldn t you Peter looked doubtful He was nervous Suppose Hilary met Urquhart again Dire possibilities opened Next time it might be Peter must go and stay at your uncle s place in Berkshire That would be worse Yes the worst had not happened after all Urquhart might have met Peggy Peggy would in that case have said You nice kind boy you ve been such a dear to this little brother of ours and I hear you and these boys used to share a mamma so you re really brothers and so of course my brother too and what a nice face you ve got There were in fact no limits to what Peggy might say Peggy was outrageous But it was surprising how much one could bear from her Presumably Peter used to reflect in after years when he had to bear from her a very great deal indeed it was simply by virtue of her being Peggy It was the same with Hilary They were Hilary and Peggy and one took them as such Indeed one had to as there was certainly no altering them And Peter loved both of them very much indeed When Peter went home for the holidays he found that Hilary s alliance with the woman Peggy Callaghan was not smiled upon But then none of Hilary s projects were ever smiled upon by his uncle who always said Hilary must do as he likes But he is acting with his usual lack of judgment For four years he had been saying so and he said it again now To Hilary himself he further said You can t afford a wife at all You certainly can t afford Miss Callaghan You have no right whatever to marry until you are earning a settled livelihood You are not of the temperament to make any woman consistently happy Miss Callaghan is the daughter of an Irish doctor and a Catholic It is said Hilary the most beautiful of all the religions If I could bring myself under the yoke of any creed at all Just so said his uncle who was a disagreeable man but you can t and Hilary tolerantly left it at that merely adding There will be no difficulty We have arranged all that Peggy is not a bigot As to the rest I think we must judge for ourselves I shall be earning more now I imagine Hilary always imagined that imagination was his strong point His initial mistake was to imagine that he could paint He did not think that he had yet painted anything very good but he knew that he was just about to do so He had really the artist s eye and saw keenly the beauty that was though he did not know it beyond his grasp His uncle who knew nothing about art could have told him that he would never be able to paint simply because he had never been and would never be able to work That gift he wholly lacked Besides like young Peter he seemed constitutionally incapable of success A wide and quick receptiveness a considerable power of appreciation and assimilation made such genius as they had the power of performance they desperately lacked their enterprises always let them through Failure was the tragi comic note of their unprosperous careers However Hilary succeeded in achieving marriage with the cheerful Peggy Callaghan and having done so they went abroad and lived an uneven and rather exciting life of alternate squalor and luxury in one story of what had once been a glorious roseate home of Venetian counts and was now crumbling to pieces and let in flats to the poor Hilary and his wife were most suitably domiciled therein environed by a splendid dinginess and squalor pretentious tawdry grandiose and superbly evading the common Peggy wrote to Peter in her large sprawling hand You dear little
