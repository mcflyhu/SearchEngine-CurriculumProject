For some moments neither girl spoke Tavia stood out in the road like an officer while Dorothy did not lift her head from her attitude of prayer Suddenly Dorothy in a frenzy of fear rushed out to where Tavia stood and threw her arms around her Tavia she exclaimed I must go to them I cannot stand another moment like this I am simply choking Come See they have not been able to manage him He is in the car yet Oh do let us go and the look on the terrified girl s face so frightened Tavia she forgot to watch forgot everything but Dorothy something would surely happen to her if that anxiety was not soon relieved But to go to the boys Might not that make matters worse Dorothy darling began Tavia don t be so frightened Perhaps they are just talking pleasantly to him Then I must hear them I must know what it is all about Do come and she tried to drag Tavia from the spot to which she seemed riveted If you would only wait here while I go down first and then if it is all right that is if the boys want us to come No no cried Dorothy I must go at once See Oh Nat is coming this way Yes here comes Nat It will be all right now and Tavia was soothing Dorothy as if she were a baby patting her smoothing her hair and even pressing her lips to her cheek In truth Dorothy appeared as weak as a baby and seemed to require that help which a loving human hand may impart to a nervous body at once the sense of protection and the assurance of sympathy Ned is starting up the machine exclaimed Tavia Oh I know He is going to give the man a ride Little dreaming how truly she spoke for indeed Ned was going to give the strange man a stranger ride Tavia showed Dorothy that she believed everything was all right now and then Nat was there they could call to him Yes he was whistling lightly How silly they were to have been frightened What is it demanded Dorothy as soon as her cousin could hear her voice I guess it was Nat Nat screamed Tavia at the same time running to him and whispering a word in his ear There now Dorothy Didn t I tell you Only a poor farmer Where did he say he lived Nat Tavia you told Nat not to tell me Ha ha ha roared Nat Well of all things Not to tell you Well I guess I will Sit right down here my little Coz and I shall be delighted to tell you all I know and at this he drew the almost exhausted girl down to a tree stump to tell her But Tavia kept close at the other side of the young man she could nudge him if well of course just to make the story funny perhaps Wanted a ride that was all declared Nat See here they are We must not notice them as they pass Why asked Dorothy But in answer Nat squeezed her hand so hard she knew he meant for her to keep quiet The car flew past Ned never glanced at those by the roadside And how strange he looked Oh Nat almost screamed Dorothy That man had on striped clothes like Queer kind of sweater They come in all sorts of stripes her cousin interrupted with a side glance at Tavia But his leg was out of the car and that was Also striped Yes I noticed his suit was not exactly of the newest fall pattern but there is no telling where a farmer may pick up his duds Like as not his wife made the trousers out of some good strong bed ticking Nat you are trying to deceive me That man is an escaped convict and Ned is riding alone with him Oh what will become of us and tears welled to Dorothy s eyes That outlet of the overstrained a good cry had come to her relief Oh there begged Nat Don t take on so It will be all right Ned will be back for us before you have your eyes dry and he kissed his little cousin affectionately And it was that awful man out of jail I knew it I could tell him before he ever got to the car I can always tell when he is coming Oh suppose he should kill Ned and she burst into a fresh flood of hysterical tears Meanwhile Tavia had not yet heard what had happened to induce Ned to take the convict away for Anderson it was Nat had told her it was that awful rascal when she cautioned him to hide it from Dorothy Certainly it was all very strange and very dangerous I suppose we have to sit here and wait for Ned to come back ventured Tavia Or else walk to meet him suggested Nat who was really anxious to do something beside sitting there listening to Dorothy cry Dry your tears Dorothy he said kindly and we will walk along It is pleasant and cool and it will do us good to have a walk Can t we get back to Dalton this way asked Dorothy Isn t this the road we came out It may be the road but it is some miles from town answered Nat Listen What was that The gong of an ambulance it sounded like exclaimed Tavia Hark At that moment a wagon turned a corner and came towards them It was a black wagon yes it did look like an ambulance Oh shrieked Dorothy What ever has happened now Why it s only the police patrol answered Nat trying to be indifferent about the matter Probably they re Hello there young fellow called a man from the wagon Have you seen a fellow in stripes about these woods The speaker was addressing Nat and he wore the uniform of a police officer Yes we have answered the young man And I can tell you all about him The wagon came to a full stop now and the officer stepped down from the seat at front while simultaneously two other officers dropped from the step at the back so that our friends suddenly became surrounded by bluecoats There said Tavia aside to Dorothy You are not afraid now are you We have enough of protection at last Which way did he go asked the officer Straight for Danvers answered Nat and in my brother s custody We had to go to a shop to get a piece of the machine fixed and left these two young ladies alone here When we returned the fellow was in our auto he had taken possession of it and refused to give it up We did everything to induce him but he absolutely refused to leave and demanded a ride so recognizing him from the description as the fellow who had escaped from Danvers my brother decided there was nothing to do but give him a ride back to the jail Well he s a plucky lad I must say declared the officer spokesman That fellow is dangerous he was just about to be committed to the asylum He s a lunatic and should never have been in jail Oh cried Dorothy If he should turn on Ned Not the least danger as long as the lad humors him said the officer We saw that said Nat and my brother knows how to manage him I guess And you are stalled now can t get home until the machine comes back asked one of the blue coats looking at Dorothy s pale face I might walk but the girls never could answered Nat Then suppose you go with us suggested the officer If the young ladies would not mind riding in a patrol Oh not at all declared Tavia but Dorothy looked askance at the wagon in which so many criminals had ridden from their freedom The best thing we can do said Nat realizing how much better any kind of ride would be than the uncertainty of waiting there as night came on Jump in then invited the officer We must be moving I don t know what the captain will think of our prisoner coming up in an automobile and the wagon bringing in this party Up the back step sprang Tavia while Dorothy followed with less alacrity it did not seem pleasant to get in the big ugly black wagon a girl of Dorothy s nature feels the mere touch of things tainted by real crime All right asked Nat as he stepped in last Yes answered Dorothy timidly taking her place on the leather seat Isn t it too jolly burst out Tavia I bet on the horse every time Of course the auto is delightful but when night cometh on Get a horse Get a horse The horse is a good old stand by admitted Nat But isn t this great though Riding into Dalton in the hurry up wagon and he joined Tavia in the laugh over their new adventure But we must watch for Ned spoke Dorothy He might go back to that lonely place I ve told the officer at front to look out for him remarked Nat He has to come this way And to think whispered Dorothy that the man was crazy and the officer said he should never have been in jail Don t you worry about him Nat told her That fellow has the faculty of making himself comfortable any place Look at his nerve in the Fire Bird We were lucky to have gotten away in time reflected Tavia We would scarcely have known how to entertain a lunatic Oh don t talk so Dorothy checked her I am so nervous and so anxious about Ned Now Dorothy declared Nat Ned is certainly all right and will be the first person to meet us when we alight from this chariot Thunder but this is fun The officers outside were talking of the strange capture A reward had been offered for the taking of the lunatic for he had been at large for some days and now the bluecoats had just missed the capture While at the blacksmith s Ned and Nat had heard of the escape of Anderson and so recognized him at once when they encountered him in their car I told you we would have three adventures Tavia reminded Dorothy And we are not home yet added Nat laughing The wagon rattled on now and then clanging its gong to warn mere people not to interfere with the law to keep out of its way We are in some village said Dorothy looking out the little glass window at front and seeing street lights along the way Presently a gang of urchins discovered the patrol wagon and as the horses slowed up around a corner the youngsters tried to get on the steps to catch a glimpse of the prisoners Look at that exclaimed Tavia laughing Wonder what they think we were taken up for Oh I feel so queer about it said Dorothy plainly discomfited I wish we could get out At that moment the wagon sprang forward the horses having been urged on and before Nat had a chance to reply to Dorothy s wish they were rattling on at greater speed than had been attained during the entire trip To reach Danvers jail the route was through Dalton and now Tavia could see Dalton houses Dalton churches and there was the postoffice block Surely the officer would not let them out right in the center Here you are called the man at front while the wagon stopped and Nat saw they were in front of the bank the most conspicuous spot in all Dalton There was nothing for them to do but to alight of course and by the time the officers had vacated the back step and Nat put his foot on it a crowd of people surrounded the wagon waiting to see the prisoners get out Girls exclaimed the surprised crowd in chorus Tavia Travers declared one voice as Tavia showed her head And if that isn t Dorothy Dale Well they re nice girls came another sneer talk about being good and always preaching This was almost in Dorothy s ear I guess they had better begin at home Tears came to Dorothy s eyes If her father were only there to take her hand could that be little Joe Dorothy Dorothy called a young voice Come this way We have been down to the telegraph office went on Joe for Dorothy was beside him now and we never had any idea you were in that wagon Ned just got back He was going out again to look for you Is Ned all right Dorothy managed to say while Nat was thanking the officers who were in haste to be on their way again Oh he s all right but I guess he had an awful time He was too hurried to tell us about it for he said he had to go back There s his car now Ned Ned shouted Joe at the top of his voice while Nat seeing his brother at the same moment gave his familiar whistle Tavia had not yet been able to extricate herself from the crowd Many of the boys recognized her and she was plied with all kinds of curious questions What had happened Had they been arrested for speeding Ned s presence in the automobile prompting this query or was someone hurt In fact there seemed to be no limit to the quality or quantity of questions that were being poured into Tavia s ears But Tavia was not the sort of girl to make explanations under the circumstances If friends or those who appeared to be friends could so easily lose all sympathy and become so annoyingly curious about her and Dorothy why then she declared to herself and also made it plain to some of the boys who were at liberty to tell the others what really did happen was none of their business But unfortunately there were in that crowd those too willing to draw their own conclusions especially as regarded Dorothy Dale a girl of whom so many others had been jealous Dorothy was aware of some of the remarks made but she little realized what a part the patrol wagon ride was to play in her life nor how a girl who had observed her in the vehicle was to use that knowledge against her spoke n v speak They
