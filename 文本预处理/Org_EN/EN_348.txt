The warm scent of the fir woods was about them and a darkness that made their very thoughts seem secret and secure They were the lovers of some ancient tale wandering in an old forest of enchantments seeing each other s faces pale and yearning in the dim light under the trees Eve rested against Canterton s outspread arm her head upon his shoulder as they wandered to and fro between the tall trunks of the firs They were like ghosts gliding side by side for the carpet of pine needles deadened the sound of their footsteps and they spoke but little in voices that were but murmurs For a brief hour they were forgetting life and its problems letting self sink into self surrendering everything to an intimate exultation in their nearness to each other Sometimes they would pause swayed by some common impulse and stand close together looking into each other s eyes They spoke to each other as a man and woman speak but once or twice in the course of a lifetime Dear heart is it possible that this is you Am I not flesh and blood That you should care Put your hand here Can you not feel my heart beating He would slip his hand under her head draw her face to his and kiss her forehead mouth and eyes And she would sigh with each kiss closing her eyes in a kind of ecstasy Did you ever dream of me Often It sounds like a child s question Strange I wonder if our dreams crossed Did you ever dream while I was at Latimer Nearly every night And I of you And all through the day you were with me I felt you standing beside me That s why I painted Latimer as I did Canterton had moments of incredulity and of awe He would stand motionless holding Eve s hands and looking down into her face It is very wonderful very wonderful His man s awe made her smile What a boy you are Am I I love you like that And yet really you are so strong and masterful And I could trust you utterly only Only You and not myself Oh if we could never wake again A plaintive note came into her voice She was beginning to think and to remember Eve Ah that name Is it so impossible now She reached up and gripped his wrist Don t spoil this Oh don t spoil it It will have to last us both for a lifetime Take me back dear it is time He felt a relaxing of her muscles as though she had suddenly grown faint and hesitating Not yet Yes now I ask it of you Jim They began to wander back towards the road and sometimes a shaft of moonlight struck across their faces Their exultation weakened the wings of their flight together were fluttering back towards the ground Eve to morrow She turned her face to his and spoke with a whispering vehemence There can be no to morrow But dear heart I could not bear it Have pity on me Jim And remember They saw the white road glimmering beyond the black fir trunks Eve paused They stood for some moments in silence Say good bye to me here I will say good night Oh my dearest my dear He held her very close and she felt the strength of his great arms The breath seemed to go out of her body her eyes were closed Now let me go He released her and she stepped back just a little unsteadily but trying to smile Good bye Go back now She turned went out of the wood and crossed the moonlit road It lay between them like some dim river of the underworld And Canterton was left standing in the gloom of the fir woods scent n v The air was filled with the scent of lilac
