Life was busy for Achilles There were visits to the hospital where he must not speak to his boy but only look at him and catch little silent smiles from the bandaged face and visits to the great house on the lake where he came and went freely The doors swung open of themselves it seemed as Achilles mounted the steps between the lions All the pretty life and flutter of the place had changed Detectives went in and out and instead of the Halcyon Club the Chief of Police and assistants held conferences in the big library But there was no clue to the child She had withdrawn it seemed into a clear sky James had been summoned to the library many times and questioned sharply but his wooden countenance held no light and the tale did not change by a hair He had held the horses Yes there wa n t nobody but little Miss Harris and him She was in the carriage he held the horses The horses They had frisked a bit maybe the way horses will at one o them autos that squirted by and he had quieted em down but there wa n t nobody And he was the last link between little Betty Harris and the world all the bustling wrestling interested world of Chicago that shouted extras and stared at the house on the lake and peered in at its life at the rising and eating and sleeping that went on behind the red stone walls The red stone walls had thinned to a veil and the whole world might look in because a child had been snatched away and the heart of a city understood But no one but James could have told what had happened to the child sitting with her little red cherries in the light and James was stupid and in the bottomless abyss of James s face the clue was lost Achilles had come in for his share of questioning The child had been to his shop it seemed and the papers took it up and made much of it there were headlines and pictures the public was interested The tale grew to a romance and fathers and mothers and children in Boston and New York and London heard how Betty had sat in the gay little fruit shop and listened to Achilles s stories of Athens and Greece and of the Acropolis and of the studies in Greek history and her gods and goddesses and the temples and ruins lying packed in their boxes waiting her return The daily papers were a thrilling tale with the quick touch of love and human sympathy that brings the world together To Achilles it was as if the hand of Zeus had reached and touched the child and she was not What god sheltered her beneath a magic veil so that she passed unseen He lifted his face seeking in air and sun and cloud a token Over the lake came the great breeze speaking to him and out of the air a thousand hands reached to him to tell him of the child But he could not find the place that held her In the dusky shop he held his quiet way No one looking would have guessed Two cen s yes and his swift fingers made change while his eyes searched every face But the child in her shining cloud was not revealed When he was summoned before the detectives and questioned with swift sternness it was his own questions that demanded answer and got it The men gathered in the library baffled by the search and asking futile dreary questions learned to wait in amusement for the quick searching gestures flung at them and the eager face that seemed to drink their words Gradually they came to understand the Greek was learning the science of kidnapping its methods and devices and the probable plan of approach But the Chief shook his head You won t trace these men by any of the old tricks It s a new deal We shall only get them by a fluke And to his own men he said Try any old chance boys run it down if it takes weeks Harris won t compromise and you may stumble on a clue The man that finds it makes money Gradually they drew their lines around the city but still from the tapped wires the messages came to them sitting in conclave in the library to Philip Harris in his bare office and to the mother waiting alone in her room At last she could not bear it I cannot hold out Philip she said one day when he had come in and found her hanging up the receiver with a fixed look Don t trust me dear Take me away And that night the big car had borne her swiftly from the city out to the far breathing air of the plain and the low hills In her room in the house on the lake her little telephone bell tinkled and waited and rang again baffled by long silence and by discreet replies The tapped wires concentrated now upon Philip Harris working by suggestion and veiled threat on his overwrought nerves till his hand shook when he reached out to the receiver and his voice betrayed him in his denials They were closing on him with hints of an ultimatum He dared not trust himself He left the house to the detectives and went down to the offices where he could work and no one could get at him Every message from the outside world came to him sifted and he breathed more freely as he took up the telephone The routine of business steadied him In a week he should be himself he could return to the attack Then a message got through to him up through the offices The man who delivered it spoke in a clear straight voice that did not rise or fall He had agreed to give the message he said a hundred thousand paid to day or no communication for three months The child would be taken out of the country The men behind the deal were getting tired and would drop the whole business They had been more than fair in the chances they had offered for compromise There was a little pause in the message then the voice went on I am one of your own men Harris inside the works a man that you killed in the way of business I agreed to give you the message for quits Good bye The voice rang off and Philip Harris sat alone A man that he had killed in the way of business Hundreds of them at work for him New York Cincinnati St Louis It would not be easy to trace a man that he had killed in business So he sat with bent head in the circle of his own works the network he had spread over the land and somewhere outside that circle his child the very heart was held as hostage three months Little Betty He shivered a little and got op and reached for a flask of brandy and poured it out gulping it down He looked about the room inside now He had shut himself in his citadel and they were inside The brandy stayed his hand from shaking but he knew that he had weakened His mind went back to the man he had killed in business the straight clear voice sounding over the phone he had not wanted to ruin him them hundreds of them It was the System kill or be killed He took his chance and they took theirs and they had gone down halcyon n He yearned for the halcyon day sof his childhood He saw visions of a halcyon future withdrawn vt vi Our force has been
