Henrietta Hen s heart began to thump She dropped a bit of cabbage out of her bill letting it fall as if it burned her And usually she was very careful as to her table manners Goodness she said to Jimmy Rabbit who was busily munching cabbage in Farmer Green s garden You frighten me He had just asked her this strange question Did you ever hear it said that eating too much cabbage causes long ears And Henrietta Hen didn t want long ears She knew they would be sure to spoil her beauty Jimmy Rabbit had no time to say anything more to Henrietta Hen Although he had not finished his luncheon he left the garden suddenly and in great haste For old dog Spot began barking just beyond the fence and Jimmy Rabbit always wanted to get as far from that sound as he could When Spot scurried into the cabbage patch a little later Henrietta Hen called to him What is it he asked her impatiently I m in a great hurry I don t like to stop This is a very important matter said Henrietta Hen Do you like cabbage she demanded Cabbage he repeated after her as a puzzled look came over his face You needn t act so surprised Henrietta told him coldly You didn t come running into the garden for nothing And I have reason to believe that you intended to eat some of Farmer Green s cabbages What s your reason old Spot inquired You have long ears said Henrietta Nonsense cried Spot What a person eats doesn t make his ears either long or short Are you sure of that Henrietta Hen wanted to know I ve never eaten cabbage in all my life he declared Still she couldn t rid herself of her fears Perhaps she said if you had eaten it your ears would have grown twice as long as they are now He shook his head I don t think so he muttered There s only one way to find out Henrietta announced Eat a lot of cabbage all you can And we ll soon see whether your ears are growing longer But old dog Spot refused flatly to do anything of the sort He said that his ears suited him quite well just as they were What Henrietta cried Wouldn t you eat cabbage to oblige a lady Old Spot said he was sorry but he had no liking for cabbage How can you tell if you ve never tasted it she asked He made no answer to that question Instead he asked her one of his own Would you like long ears he inquired Certainly not she cried How can you tell if you ve never tried wearing any he demanded Don t be stupid she snapped None of my family wears ears that can be seen What a sight I d be with long ears Ears are very ugly things and I only hope that I haven t eaten so much cabbage that mine will begin to grow Do you suppose they d hang down like yours or stick up like Jimmy Rabbit s He didn t say anything about that Old dog Spot let out a howl Jimmy Rabbit he growled Was he talking with you just before I arrived Yes said Henrietta It was he that asked me if I had ever heard that eating cabbage made a person s ears grow I might have known that it was that young Rabbit who put such a silly notion into your head Spot grumbled If you hadn t stopped me I d have stopped him by this time But it s too late now You don t suppose he was joking do you Henrietta inquired Of course he was said Spot and none too pleasantly Well Henrietta mused as she pecked at a cabbage leaf I must say that I think the joke s on you thump v n The thief hit him a thump on the head The excitement made her heart thump munching v munch He was munching an apple Munching the apple as he was he had an eye for all her movements luncheon n We have luncheon at twelve o clock I have a luncheon engagement scurried v scurry She said goodbye and scurried back to work It began to rain and we scurried for shelter liking n The word palate also means taste or liking Palate I must admit I have no liking for exaggeration growled v growl \ They ought to be birched \ growled the old man He growled out an answer grumbled grumble He grumbled at the low pay offered to him The heat was sweltering and the men grumbled fiercely over their work mused v muse \ I wonder if I shall ever see them again \ he mused \ Where are we going from here \ mused one of Rutherford s guests
