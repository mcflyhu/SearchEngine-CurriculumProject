III Roddy stood staring blankly unconsciously sucking at a raw spot on his finger where the powder had burned it At his feet the bottle of cura ao from which he had just been drinking was rolling upon the gravel path its life blood bubbling out upon the pebbles He stooped and lifted it Later he remembered wondering how it had come there and at the time that so much good liquor had been wasted had seemed a most irritating circumstance He moved to replace the bottle upon the table and found the table overturned with Peter his clothes dripping and his eyes aflame emerging from beneath it Further up the path the young Venezuelan was struggling in the arms of his friends Fearful that he might still be in danger they were restraining him and he eager to pursue the man who had fired on him was crying aloud his protests Others of his friends were racing down the different paths breaking through the bushes and often in their excitement seizing upon one another Huddled [Pg ]together in a group the waiters and coachmen explained gesticulated shrieked But above the clamor of all the voice of Peter was the most insistent Leaping from a wreck of plates and glasses his clothing splashed with claret with coffee with salad dressing with the tablecloth wound like a kilt about his legs he jumped at Roddy and Roddy retreated before him Raging and in the name of profane places Peter demanded what Roddy meant by it Look at me he commanded Look what you did Look at me Roddy did not look If he looked he knew he would laugh And he knew Peter was hoping he would laugh so that at that crowning insult he might fall upon him In tones of humble acute regret Roddy protested I did it Peter he stammered hastily I did it to save you I was afraid he would hit you I had to act quickly Afraid he d hit me roared Peter You hit me Hit me with a table Look at my new white flannel suit And look at this With his fingers he gingerly parted his wet disheveled hair Look at the bump on the back of my head Is that your idea of saving me I wish he exploded savagely I wish he d shot you full of holes [Pg ]The violent onslaught of Peter was interrupted by one hardly less violent from the young Venezuelan He had freed himself from his friends and as it now was evident the man who had attempted his life had escaped and that to search further was useless he ran to thank the stranger who had served him Extravagantly but with real feeling he wrung both of Roddy s hands In the native fashion he embraced him shook him by the shoulders patted him affectionately on the back Eloquently but incoherently in Spanish French and English he poured forth his thanks He hailed Roddy as his preserver his bon amigo his brav camarad In expressing their gratitude his friends were equally voluble and generous They praised they applauded they admired in swift graceful gestures they re nacted for each other the blow upon the chin the struggle for the revolver the escape of the would be assassin Even Peter as the only one who had suffered became a heroic figure It was many minutes before the Americans could depart and then only after every one had drunk to them in warm sweet champagne When the glasses were filled the young Venezuelan turned to those standing about him on the grass and commanded silence He now spoke in excellent[Pg ] English but Roddy noted that those of the older men who could not understand regarded him with uneasiness I ask you my friends cried the Venezuelan to drink to the name of Forrester How much he exclaimed does not that name mean to my unhappy country I myself that my life should be taken it is nothing but that it should be saved for my country by one of that name is for us an omen a lucky omen It means he cried the soft liquid eyes flashing it means success It means As though suddenly conscious of the warning frowns of his friends he paused abruptly and with a graceful bow and waving his glass toward Roddy said quietly Let us drink to the son of a good friend of Venezuela to Mr Forrester Not until the landau was well on its way to Willemstad did Roddy deem it wise to make a certain inquiry What he asked of the driver is the name of the gentleman that the other gentleman tried to shoot The driver turned completely in his seat His eyes were opened wide in amazement You don t know that gentleman he exclaimed I think everybody know that gentleman [Pg ]He be very brave Venezuela gentleman he be Colonel Vega As though sure of the effect of that name the driver paused dramatically but except that the two Americans looked inquiringly at each other they made no sign Mebbe I better call that gentleman Pino the driver suggested Everybody call him Pino just like he be everybody s brother The man showed his teeth broadly in a delighted grin The market womens the sailor mens the police mens the black peoples and the white gentlemens everybodys call him Pino Pino he be exiled If he go to his country that President Alvarez he say he shoot him So Pino go over that way with his whip he pointed to the east They say he go live in Paris But yesterday he come in that steamer and all the peoples be waiting at that wharf Everybody be glad to see Pino Everybody but that man with that gun suggested Roddy The driver rolled his eyes darkly and pursed his lips That be bad man he said Did President Alvarez inquired Roddy pleasantly send that bad man over here to shoot the too popular Pino Peter uttered a sudden growl of indignation [Pg ] Look where you are driving he ordered When the negro had turned to his horses Peter stared at Roddy long and steadily What that parrot said of you he declared grimly was true Those Venezuelans who at once had set forth on their ponies to overtake the would be assassin already had brought word of the attempt upon Colonel Vega to Willemstad and the repose of the peaceful burgh was greatly ruffled The arrival of the young men increased the excitement and though they fled to their rooms from their balcony overlooking the wharf they could hear their driver enthroned upon his box seat describing the event to an intent and eager audience As Peter was changing into dry clothes he held his watch so that Roddy could note the hour How long would you have said we have been living on this island he asked Oh at least a week exclaimed Roddy I have had more excitement than I could get in New York in a year and we haven t been here twelve hours But it is all over now Peter announced We can t stay here We re getting too chummy with this Venezuelan crowd thanks to you What have I done now complained Roddy [Pg ] You can t help being who you are admitted Peter but you can see that this town is a red hot incubator for revolutions Every one in it thinks of nothing else and every one thinks you are in deep with your father against Alvarez and if we linger here Alvarez will think so too We ve got to get back to Porto Cabello where we have a clean bill of health Roddy had stretched himself upon his cot in preparation for his afternoon siesta but he sat upright his face filled with dismay And not see the Rojas family he cried Peter growled indignantly See them How can you see them he demanded We only drove past their house along a public road and already everybody in town has a flashlight picture of us doing it But objected Roddy we haven t got our credentials We ll have to do without them declared Peter I tell you if you get mixed up with Brother Pino when you get back to Porto Cabello you ll go to jail And what chance will we have then of saving General Rojas He will stay in prison and die there As White Mice announced Peter firmly we have our work to do and we must not be turned aside by anybody s revolution [Pg ] your father s or Pino Vega s or anybody s We re White Mice first last and all the time Our duty isn t to take life but to save it As though suddenly surprised by a new idea Peter halted abruptly I suppose he demanded scornfully you think you prevented a murder this morning and you will be claiming the White Mice medal for saving life I certainly will declared Roddy cheerfully and you will have to certify I earned it because you saw me earn it But I didn t declared Peter I was under the table Roddy closed his eyes and again fell back upon the cot For so long a time was he silent that Peter who had gone out upon the balcony supposed him asleep when Roddy suddenly raised himself on his elbow Anyway he began abruptly we can t leave here until the boat takes us away three days from now I ll bet in three days I ll get all the credentials we want Roddy had been awake since sunrise the heat was soporific the events of the morning exhausting and in two minutes unmindful of revolutions indifferent to spies to plots and counter plots he was [Pg ]sleeping happily But as he slumbered in two lands at great distances apart he and his affairs were being earnestly considered On the twenty seventh floor of the Forrester Building his father with perplexed and frowning brows studied a cablegram in the Casa Blanca Se ora Rojas and her daughters listened in amazement to a marvelous tale Had it not been their faithful friend and jealous guardian the American Consul who was speaking they could not have credited it At the Forrester Building the cablegram had been just translated from the secret code of the company and placed upon the desk of Mr Forrester It was signed by Von Amberg and read To day at meeting your party unknown man fired three shots Vega Young Forrester overpowered man Vega unhurt man escaped Understand young Forrester not in our confidence Please instruct Three times Mr Forrester read the cablegram and then laying it upon his knee sat staring out of the open window Before his physical eyes were deep ca ons of office buildings like his own towering crag above crag white curling columns of smoke from busy tugboats and the great loom of the Brooklyn Bridge with its shuttles of clattering cable cars [Pg ]But what he saw was his son alone in a strange land struggling with an unknown man a man intent on murder With a hand that moved unsteadily the Light house King lifted the desk telephone and summoned the third vice president and when Mr Sam Caldwell had entered silently gave him the cablegram Sam Caldwell read it and exclaimed with annoyance Looks to me he commented briskly as though they know why Pino came back Looks as though they had sent this fellow to do him up before we can In a strange thin voice Mr Forrester stopped him sharply If the boy d been hurt they d have said so wouldn t they he demanded Sam Caldwell recognized his error Carefully he reread the cablegram Why of course he assented heartily It says here he overpowered the other fellow says Vega unhurt In the same unfamiliar strained tone Mr Forrester interrupted It doesn t say Roddy is unhurt he objected The young man laughed reassuringly But the very fact they don t say so shows why they d know that s what you most want to hear I wouldn t worry about Roddy Not for a minute Embarrassed by his own feeling annoyed that Sam Caldwell should have discovered it Mr Forrester answered You wouldn t He isn t your son He reached for a cable form and wrote rapidly Von Amberg Willemstad Cura ao W I Forrester most certainly not in our confidence Return him Cabello Is he the pen hesitated and then again moved swiftly unhurt He drew another blank toward him and addressing it to McKildrick wrote Why is Forrester in Cura ao Cable him return Keep him on job or lose yours For a moment Mr Forrester sat studying the two messages then he raised his eyes I have half a mind he said to order him home I would if he weren t doing so well down there With an effort to eliminate from his voice any accent of fatherly pride Mr Forrester asked coldly McKildrick reports that he is doing well doesn t he The third vice president nodded affirmatively If he comes back here argued Mr Forrester he ll do nothing but race his car and he ll learn nothing of the business And then again he added doubtfully while he s down there I don t want him to learn too much of the business not this Pino Vega end of it or he might want to take a hand and that might embarrass us Perhaps I had better cable him too He looked inquiringly at the third vice president but that gentleman refused to be drawn He isn t my son he remarked I am not speaking of him as my son snapped Mr Forrester warmly Speaking of him not as my son but as an employee of the company what would you do with him I d cable him to mind his own business answered Sam Caldwell For the fraction of a second under levelled eyebrows Mr Forrester stared at young Mr Caldwell and then as a sign that the interview was at an end swung in his swivel chair and picked up his letters Over his shoulder he said Cable him that While Roddy in Willemstad was slumbering under his mosquito net and Sam Caldwell in New York was concocting a cablegram which he calculated would put Roddy in his proper place but which instead put him in a very bad temper [Pg ]Captain Codman at Casa Blanca had just finished relating his marvelous tale It was the story of how young Forrester without letters of introduction without credentials had that morning walked into the consulate and announced that without asking advice he intended to liberate the Lion of Valencia Upon the members of the Rojas household the marvelous tale had a widely different effect To understand why this should be so it is necessary to know something of the three women who formed the Rojas household Se ora Rojas was an American When she was very young her father a professor at one of the smaller universities in New England in order to study the archives of the Spanish rulers of Venezuela had visited that country and taken his daughter with him She was spirited clever and possessed of the particular type of beauty the Spaniard admires Young Rojas saw her and at once fell in love with her and after the death of her father which occurred in the North followed her there and married her She then was very young and he an attach in the diplomatic service Since their marriage unlike many of his countrymen Rojas had not looked with interest upon any other woman and with each year of their life together their affection had grown stronger their dependence upon each other had increased In wisdom in experience in honors Rojas had grown rich In countries where his own was only a spot upon the map Rojas himself the statesman the diplomat the man who spoke and read in many languages the charming host with the brilliant wife was admired sought after There were three children the two girls and a son a lieutenant of artillery whose death during the revolution of Andreda had brought to the family its first knowledge of grief Of the two sisters Lolita the elder was like her father grave gracious speaking but seldom and in spite of the years spent in foreign capitals still a Spanish American Her interests were in her church her music and the duties of the household Of all the names given at her christening to the younger sister the one that survived was Inez Inez was a cosmopolitan She had been permitted to see too much of the world to make it possible for her ever again to sit down tamely behind the iron bars of the Porto Cabello drawing room She was too much like her American mother not as her mother was now after thirty years in a Venezuelan s household but as her mother had been when she left the New England [Pg ]college town Unlike her sister she could not be satisfied with the cloister like life of the young girls of Spanish America During the time her father had served as minister to Paris she had been at school in the convent at Neuilly but at the time he was transferred to London she was of an age to make her bow at court and old enough to move about with a freedom which had it been permitted her at home would have created public scandal She had been free to ride in the Row to play tennis to walk abroad even through public streets and parks even when it rained even unattended She had met men not always as prospective suitors but as friends and companions And there had been a wonderful visit to her mother s country and her mother s people when for a summer she had rejoiced in the friendly inconsequent out of door life of a Massachusetts seaside colony Once on the North Shore and later on Cape Cod she had learned to swim to steer a knockabout to dance the Boston even in rubber soled shoes to sit out on the Casino balcony and hear young men with desperate anxiety ask if there were any more in South America like her To this question she always replied that there were not and that in consequence if the young man had any thoughts on the [Pg ]subject she was the person to whom they should be addressed Then following the calm uneventful life of the convent of London and its gayeties of the Massachusetts coast with its gray fogs and open drift wood fires came the return to her own country There with her father she rode over his plantations among the wild cattle or with her mother and sister sat in the patio and read novels in three languages or sleepily watched the shadow of the tropical sun creep across the yellow wall And then suddenly all of these different happy lives were turned into memories shadows happenings of a previous and unreal existence There came a night which for months later in terrified dreams returned to haunt her a night when she woke to find her bed surrounded by soldiers to hear in the court yard the sobs of her mother and the shrieks of the serving women to see her father concerned only for his wife and daughters in a circle of the secret police to see him before she could speak with him hurried to a closed carriage and driven away Then had begun the two years of exile in Willemstad the two years of mourning not of quiet grief for one at rest but anxious unending distress for one alive one dearly loved one tortured in mind enduring petty indignities bodily torments degradations that killed the soul and broke the brave spirit To the three women Rojas had been more than husband or father He had been their knight their idol their reason for happiness They alone knew how brave he was how patient how beyond imagination considerate That they should be free to eat and sleep to work and play while he was punished like a felon buried alive unable to carry on the work in the world God had given him to do caused them intolerable misery While he suffered there was no taste in life and the three shut themselves from the world They admitted only the Consul who had been his friend and those who like themselves were exiles and in whose hatred of Alvarez lay their only hope of again seeing the one they loved Time after time a plan of rescue had failed A plot that promised release had been disclosed and the conspirators punished Hope had left them and on the part of their friends had been followed by lethargy But within the last three months a new hope had arisen and with it for the younger daughter a new distress It was whispered that a revolution backed by great wealth and sanctified by the prayers of the people was to be started near Valencia Its leader in the field was to be young Pino Vega in several campaigns the personal aide de camp of General Rojas a young man indebted to his chief for many favors devoted to him by reason of mutual confidence and esteem If successful this revolt against Alvarez was to put Vega in command of the army to free Rojas and to place him as president at Miraflores To the women the thought that Rojas might become president was intolerable It was because he had consented to be president that he had suffered The mere thought of the office and of the cruelties that had been practised by the man who held it made it to the women terrifying For Rojas they wanted neither position nor power They wanted Rojas free They wanted to hold him close to touch him to look into his eyes to see the gentle understanding smile Each felt that there was nothing she could not do no sacrifice she would not make if once more she could sit beside him holding his hand waiting in silence for the joy of hearing him speak And of the younger girl the sacrifice has been required At least a way in which she could assist the cause that would lead to the freedom of her father had been presented to her From Paris Pino Vega [Pg ]had written her mother requesting permission to ask Inez to be his wife To the girl of all the men she knew in Venezuela Pino was the most attractive They both had lived for years outside of their own country and in consequence had much in common He was thirty seven older than she by fourteen years but as has already been pointed out in appearance in manner in spirits he seemed much younger than his years To his detriment nothing could be said that could not have been said of the other young men of his class in his country But the girl was not in love with the young man of that class nor with her country Her brother had been sacrificed in what to her had seemed but a squalid struggle for place between two greedy politicians her father for the very reason that he had served his country loyally faithfully and was in consequence beloved by the people had been caged like a wild animal She had no love for her native land She distrusted and feared it Night after night as she paced the walk along the cliff where the waves broke at her feet she shuddered to think of returning to that land only sixty miles from her that had robbed her of so much that had made life beautiful of all up to the present that had made it happy She wished never to see it again Could her father have been returned to her she would have rejoiced that they were exiles And as she distrusted the country she distrusted the men of the country at least those of the class to which Vega belonged She knew them well the born orators born fighters born conspirators To scheme to plot to organize against the authority of the moment was in their blood If she thought of a possible husband and in a country where a girl marries at fifteen and where her first if not her only duty in life is to marry it would have been surprising if she had not the man she considered as a husband was not a Venezuelan For their deference to women for their courtesy to each other for their courage as shown in their campaigns for their appreciation of art of letters of music she greatly admired her countrymen but that they themselves created nothing that they scorned labor and all those who labored made them to Inez intolerable That she was half an American of the North was to her a source of secret pride With satisfaction she remembered young men she had known during the summers on the North Shore and Cape Cod the young men who during the first of the week toiled and sweltered in their offices and who when the week end came took their pleasures strenuously in exercise and sport She liked to remember that her American and English devotees had treated her as a comrade as an intelligent thinking creature They had not talked to her exclusively of the beauty of her eyes her teeth and hair She preferred their breathless Well played partner to the elaborate I saw the Se orita at mass this morning As she raised her eyes to Heaven the angels grew jealous When the mother told Inez that Colonel Vega had written proposing on his return to pay his addresses to her the girl was in genuine distress She protested earnestly In thirty years Se ora Rojas unconsciously had assimilated the thoughts the habits the attitude of mind of the women of her adopted country and when Inez had finished her protest her mother seeing the consequence from her own point of view was greatly disturbed It is most unfortunate she said Pino is selfish when he learns you will not listen to him he will be very angry and he will be less eager to help your father He will think only of himself If you only could have cared Pino could not be so cruel said the girl But she spoke as though she were arguing against her own conviction He cannot be so vain so spoiled she protested that because one woman fails to fall on her knees to him he must punish her The talk between the mother and daughter had taken place a week before Colonel Vega s arrival from Paris On the day his steamer was due Se ora Rojas again spoke to Inez After mass this morning she said I consulted Father Paul about Pino He hopes it will be possible for you not to give him a direct answer He says Pino will be leaving us almost at once He is to land north of Porto Cabello and our people are to join him there Father Paul thinks the Se ora hesitated and then went on hastily you might let him go in ignorance You might ask for time to consider You might even tell him The girl s cheeks flushed crimson and the tears came to her eyes The mother looked away After an instant s silence she exclaimed bitterly It is only a lie to a man who has lied to many women I think of nothing she declared but that it would keep him true to your father What else matters she broke forth I would lie cheat steal she cried if I could save your father one moment s suffering The girl took the hand of the elder woman and pressed it to her cheek I know she whispered I know There was a moment s silence If it were anything else protested the girl If I could change places with father I would run to do it you know that but this with a gesture of repugnance the girl threw out her hands to pretend to care It is degrading it makes me feel unclean You will make an enemy asked the mother coldly of the only person who can bring your father back to us Sooner than let Pino think you care for him you would let him turn against us You and Pino she pleaded are old friends Your father is his friend What more natural She broke forth hysterically I beg of you she cried I command you not to make an enemy of Pino Tell him to wait tell him that now you can think of nothing but your father but that when your father is free that if he will only set him free The mother held the girl toward her searching her eyes Promise me she begged Inez regarded her mother unhappily and turned away This then on the afternoon of Colonel Vega s arrival at Cura ao was the position toward him and toward each other of the three women of the Rojas household and explains perhaps why when that same afternoon Captain Codman told them the marvelous tale of Roddy s proposition Se ora Rojas and her daughter received the news each in a different manner Before she had fully understood Se ora Rojas exclaimed with gratitude It is the hand of God It is His hand working through this great company Not at all snapped Captain Codman The company has nothing to do with it As far as I can see it is only the wild plan of a harum scarum young man He has no authority He s doing it for excitement for an adventure He doesn t seem to know anything of of what is going on and personally I think he s mad He and his friend are the two men who twice drove past your house this morning What his friend is like I don t know but Forrester seems quite capable of forcing his way in here He wants what he calls credentials In fact when I refused to help him he as much as threatened to come here and get them for himself The voice of Se ora Rojas was shaken with alarm He is coming here she cried But if he is seen here they will know at once at Caracas and my husband will suffer It may mean the end of everything Her voice rose trembling with indignation How dare he How dare he for the sake of an adventure risk the life of my husband How can he expect to succeed where our friends have failed and now when Pino has returned and there is hope I told him that said the Consul You warned him insisted the Se ora you told him he must not come near us Inez who with her sister stood eagerly intent behind the chair in which their mother was seated laid her hand soothingly upon the Se ora s shoulder Is it best she asked to turn the young man away without learning what he wishes to do Living in Porto Cabello he may know something we could not know Did you find out she asked the Consul in what way Mr Forrester wishes to help us No confessed Captain Codman I did not I was so taken aback he explained he was so ignorant so cocksure that he made me mad And I just ordered him out and I told him told him for his own good of course the Consul added hastily that he talked too much With critical eyes Inez regarded her old friend doubtfully and shook her head at him And how did he take that she asked He told me answered the Consul painfully truthful that my parrot had said the same thing and that we might both be wrong There was an instant s silence and then Inez laughed In shocked tones her mother exclaimed reprovingly But he comes here protested the girl to do us a service the greatest service and he is ordered away Why should we refuse to let him help us to let any one help us We should make the most of every chance that offers Se ora Rojas turned in her chair and looked steadily at her daughter Your advice is good Inez she said but it comes strangely from you At the same moment as though conjured by her thought a servant announced Colonel Vega and that gentleman with several of those who had lunched with him at the Caf Ducrot entered the room In alarm Captain Codman waited only to shake hands with the visitors and then precipitately departed But in the meeting of the exiles there was nothing that would have compromised him The reception of Colonel Vega by the three women was without outward significance They greeted him not as a leader of their conspiracy but as they might have received any friend who after an absence had returned to them When he bent over the hand of Inez he raised his liquid eyes to hers but the girl welcomed him simply without confusion He decided that her mother could not as yet have told her of his wishes Had she done so he felt sure in view of the honor he would pay her her embarrassment at meeting him would have been apparent to all Vega himself elected to tell the ladies of the attack made upon him at the Caf Ducrot He made little of it He let the ladies understand that his life like that of all public men was always at the mercy of assassins To Roddy he gave full credit Imagine this man reaching for his weapon he related dramatically myself too far from him to fall upon him and my arms resting upon the shoulders of my two good friends Their safety also is in my mind But I am helpless I saw the villain smile confidently He points the weapon Then the young man springs upon him and the bullets pass us harmlessly Believe me but for Mr Forrester all three of us General Pulido Colonel Ramon and myself might now be dead The two gentlemen designated dismissed the thought with a negligent wave of the hand It suggested that to soldiers like themselves being dead was an annoyance to which they had grown accustomed Mr Forrester exclaimed Inez catching at the name Mr Forrester repeated her mother But I thought I was told only just now that he knew nothing of our plans That is quite true Colonel Vega assured her He was not with us He was there by accident Let us rather say corrected Se ora Rojas piously he was placed there by a special Providence to save you That the Almighty should be especially concerned in his well being did not appear to Vega as at all unlikely He nodded his head gravely It may be so he admitted Through force of habit Se ora Rojas glanced about her but the open windows showed the empty garden and around her seated in two rows of rocking chairs the ladies facing the door the men facing the ladies she saw only friends But why she asked is young Mr Forrester not in the confidence of his father Can he not trust his own son As though sure of her answer she cast a triumphant glance at the daughter who had dared against Captain Codman and herself to champion Mr Forrester s son Pino frowned mysteriously He did not like to say that with any action of the great Mr Forrester he was not acquainted So he scowled darkly and shook his head It is a puzzle he said the young man is a fine fellow To him I owe my life He appealed to his friends who in time to the sedate rocking of the chairs nodded gravely But his father is very decided He cables us to send him at once to Porto Cabello He instructs us not to let him know what we plan to do I learned that in Porto Cabello he is only a workman or a little better the foreman of the Jamaica coolies I do not say so Pino pointed out as though if he wished he might say a great deal but it looks as though he were here for some punishment as though he had displeased his father Or he demanded why should his father who is so wealthy give his son the wages of a foreman During the visit of the conspirators the traditions of Spanish etiquette gave Colonel Vega no opportunity to separate Inez from the others and soon without having spoken to her alone he and his followers departed When they had gone Inez as was her custom when she wished to be by herself ordered her pony and rode out on the cliff road toward the orange groves Riding unattended was a breach of Spanish American convention But her mother permitted it and in the eyes of the people of Willemstad her long residence abroad and the fact that she was half American of the North partially excused it Every morning at sunrise before the heat of the day and just before the sun set Inez made these excursions They were the bright moments of her present life If she did not wish to think they prevented her from thinking if she did wish to think they protected her from intrusion and gave her strength and health to bear the grinding anxiety of the other hours They brought back to her also memories of rides of former days before her father had been taken from her when they had trotted politely over the tan bark of Rotten Row or when with her soldier brother she had chased the wild cattle on the plantation Now with her head bent with the hand that held the reins lying loosely on her knee she rode at a walk her body relaxed her eyes seeing nothing [Pg ]Her mind was intent upon her problem one in which her answer to Pino Vega was but a part To carry out the plan she had in mind she needed a man to help her and there were two men to whom she might appeal But only one not both of them could help her She was determined not to return from her ride until she had decided which one it should be After an hour as though she had reached her decision and was fearful lest she might reconsider it she lifted the pony into a gallop and raced to Casa Blanca On arriving there she went directly to her room wrote a note and returned with it to the stable where the groom was just removing the saddle from her pony He was an old man trusted by Inez As a body servant he had first served her brother then her father and after the imprisonment of General Rojas had volunteered to follow the women of the family into exile For a moment the girl regarded him earnestly Pedro she asked what would you do to save the master When the man was assured he had understood her he lowered the saddle to the ground and standing erect threw out his arms with his open palms toward her In pantomime he seemed to signify that for the purpose she named his body his life was at her disposition Inez showed him the note You will take this she said to an American Mr Forrester He is at one of the hotels No one must know you are seeking him no one must see you give him this note Not even my mother must suspect that any message has been sent from this house to that gentleman When he has read the note he will say yes or no If he asks questions you will shake your head As soon as you get your answer come directly to me She gave him the note and after an impressive delay continued There is a new plan to save my father If you deliver this note safely you will have taken the first step to set him free If you blunder if it is found out that Mr Forrester and one of the Rojas family are conspiring together it will mean greater cruelties for my father it may mean his death The girl had spoken in the way she knew would best appeal to the man before her And she was not disappointed His eyes shone with excitement That he was conspiring that he was a factor in a plot that the plot had in view the end he so much desired filled him with pleasure and pride Crossing himself he promised to carry out her orders As Inez returned to the main portion of the house the sun was just sinking into the sea and to keep their daily tryst her mother and sister were moving toward the cliff While the crimson disk descended the three women stood silent and immovable the face of each turned toward the rim of the horizon As though her eyes could pierce the sixty miles that lay between her and her father Inez leaned forward her fingers interlaced her lips slightly apart That at that moment he was thinking of her that he was looking to where he knew she was on guard and thinking of him moved her as greatly as though the daily ceremony was for the first time being carried forward A wandering breeze not born of the sea but of the soil of tropical plants and forests and warm with sunshine caressed her face It came from the land toward which her eyes were turned It was comforting sheltering breathing of peace As it touched her she smiled slightly She accepted it as a good omen as a message sent from across the sea to tell her that in the step she had taken she had done well gravel n We bought six bags of gravel for the garden path More gravel is needed to fill the
