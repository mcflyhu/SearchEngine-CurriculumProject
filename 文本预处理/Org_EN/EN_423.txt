In an angle of the wood the dust covered policeman and the white capped man came upon the racer turned a little from the road and waiting their arrival It had a stolid helpless look with its nose buried deep in underbrush and the hind wheels tilted a little in air Once might almost fancy it gave a little subdued hiccough as they approached The white capped man bent above it and ran a quick hand along the side and leaped to the vacant seat The beast beneath gave a little snort and withdrew its nose and pranced playfully at the underbrush and backed away feeling for firm ground behind The man at the wheel pressed hard leaning with quick jerk and wheels gripped ground and trundled in the road It stopped beside the service car and the two men gazed doubtfully at the wood Dusty leaves trembled at them in the light air and beckoned to them little twigs laced across and shut them out Anywhere in the dark coolness of the wood the Greek lurked hiding away They could not trace him and the wood reached far into the dusk He was undoubtedly armed Only a desperate man would have made a dash like that for life Better go back to town for reinforcements and send the word of his escape along the line He would not get far on foot They gave another glance at the wood and loosed their cars to the road gliding smoothly off The wood behind them under its cover of dust gave no sign of watching eyes and the sun travelling toward the west cast their long clean shadows ahead as they went In the low light the little white house in the distance had a rosy moody look As they drew nearer little pink details flashed out An old man behind the picket fence looked up and straightened himself and gazed under a shading hand Then he came along the driveway and stood in the white gate waiting their approach He had a red guileless face and white hair The face held a look of childish interest as they drew up You got him he asked The service man shook his head jerking his thumb at the racer that came behind Got the car he said He got off took to the woods That so The old man came out to the road and looked with curious eyes at the big racing machine coming up What d he do he asked He stole my machine said the white capped man quickly He was holding the wheel with a careful touch The old man looked at him with shrewd smiling eyes chewing at some invisible cud The service man nodded to him There ll be a reward out for him Jimmie keep a watch out You may have a chance at it He s hiding somewhere over there He motioned toward the distant wood The old man turned a slow eye toward the west I don t own no telescope he said quaintly He shifted the cud a little and gazed at the plain around them far as the eye could see it stretched on every side Only the little white house stood comfortably in its midst open to the eye of heaven It was a rambling one story and a half house with no windows above the ground floor except at the rear where one window under a small peak faced the north Beyond the house in that direction lay lines of market garden and beyond the garden the wide plain Two men at work in the garden hoed with long easy strokes that lengthened in the slanting light The service man looked at them with casual eye Got good help this year he asked The old man faced about and his eye regarded them mildly Putty good he said they re my sister s boys She died this last year along in April and they come on to help Yes they work putty good They drove in ahead of us didn t they asked the service man with sudden thought The old man smiled drily Didn t know s you see em You were so occupied Yes they d been in to sell the early potatoes I ve got a putty good crop this year early potatoes They went in to make a price on em We ll get seventy five if we take em in to morrow and they asked what to do and I told em they better dig He chuckled slowly The service man smiled You keep em moving don t you Jimmie He glanced at the house Any trade Got a license this year The old man shook his head Bone dry he said chewing slowly Them cars knocked me out He came and stood by the racer running his hand along it with childish touch The service man watched him with detached smile The old man s silly shrewdness amused him He suspected him of a cask or two in the cellar In the days of bicycles the old man had driven a lively trade but with the long reaching cars his business dribbled away and he had slipped back from whiskey to potatoes He was a little disgruntled at events and would talk socialism by the hour to anyone who would listen But he was a harmless old soul The service man glanced at the sun It had dipped suddenly and the plain grew dusky black The distant figures hoeing against the plain were lost to sight Hallo said the service man quickly we must get on He looked again shrewdly toward the old man in the dusk You couldn t find a drop of anything handy to give away Jimmie he suggested The old man tottered a slow smile at him and moved toward the house He came back with a long necked bottle grasped tight and a couple of glasses that he filled in the dimness The service man held up his glass with quick gesture Here s to you Jimmie he said throwing back his head May you live long and prosper He gulped it down The old man s toothless smile received the empty glasses and when the two machines had trundled away in the dimness it stood
