From the whaleboat up the low side of the Arangi and over her six inch rail of teak to her teak deck was but a step and Tom Haggin made it easily with Jerry still under his arm The deck was cluttered with an exciting crowd Exciting the crowd would have been to untravelled humans of civilization and exciting it was to Jerry although to Tom Haggin and Captain Van Horn it was a mere commonplace of everyday life The deck was small because the Arangi was small Originally a teak built gentleman s yacht brass fitted copper fastened angle ironed sheathed in man of war copper and with a fin keel of bronze she had been sold into the Solomon Islands trade for the purpose of blackbirding or nigger running Under the law however this traffic was dignified by being called recruiting The Arangi was a labour recruit ship that carried the new caught cannibal blacks from remote islands to labour on the new plantations where white men turned dank and pestilential swamp and jungle into rich and stately cocoanut groves The Arangi s two masts were of Oregon cedar so scraped and hot paraffined that they shone like tan opals in the glare of sun Her excessive sail plan enabled her to sail like a witch and on occasion gave Captain Van Horn his white mate and his fifteen black boat s crew as much as they could handle She was sixty feet over all and the cross beams of her crown deck had not been weakened by deck houses The only breaks and no beams had been cut for them were the main cabin skylight and companionway the booby hatch for ard over the tiny forecastle and the small hatch aft that let down into the store room And on this small deck in addition to the crew were the return niggers from three far flung plantations By return was meant that their three years of contract labour was up and that according to contract they were being returned to their home villages on the wild island of Malaita Twenty of them familiar all to Jerry were from Meringe thirty of them came from the Bay of a Thousand Ships in the Russell Isles and the remaining twelve were from Pennduffryn on the east coast of Guadalcanar In addition to these and they were all on deck chattering and piping in queer almost elfish falsetto voices were the two white men Captain Van Horn and his Danish mate Borckman making a total of seventy nine souls Thought your heart d failed you at the last moment was Captain Van Horn s greeting a quick pleasure light glowing into his eyes as they noted Jerry It was sure near to doin it Tom Haggin answered It s only for you I d a done it annyways Jerry s the best of the litter barrin Michael of course the two of them bein all that s left and no better than them that was lost Now that Kathleen was a sweet dog the spit of Biddy if she d lived Here take m With a jerk of abruptness he deposited Jerry in Van Horn s arms and turned away along the deck An if bad luck comes to him I ll never forgive you Skipper he flung roughly over his shoulder They ll have to take my head first the skipper chuckled An not unlikely my brave laddy buck Haggin growled Meringe owes Somo four heads three from the dysentery an another wan from a tree fallin on him the last fortnight He was the son of a chief at that Yes and there s two heads more that the Arangi owes Somo Van Horn nodded You recollect down to the south ard last year a chap named Hawkins was lost in his whaleboat running the Arli Passage Haggin returning along the deck nodded Two of his boat s crew were Somo boys I d recruited them for Ugi Plantation With your boys that makes six heads the Arangi owes But what of it There s one salt water village acrost on the weather coast where the Arangi owes eighteen I recruited them for Aolo and being salt water men they put them on the Sandfly that was lost on the way to the Santa Cruz They ve got a jack pot over there on the weather coast my word the boy that could get my head would be a second Carnegie A hundred and fifty pigs and shell money no end the village s collected for the chap that gets me and delivers And they ain t yet Haggin snorted No fear was the cheerful retort You talk like Arbuckle used to talk Haggin censured Manny s the time I ve heard him string it off Poor old Arbuckle The most sure and most precautious chap that ever handled niggers He never went to sleep without spreadin a box of tacks on the floor and when it wasn t them it was crumpled newspapers I remember me well bein under the same roof at the time on Florida when a big tomcat chased a cockroach into the papers And it was blim blam blim six times an twice over with his two big horse pistols an the house perforated like a cullender Likewise there was a dead tom cat He could shoot in the dark with never an aim pullin trigger with the second finger and pointing with the first finger laid straight along the barrel No sir my laddy buck He was the bully boy with the glass eye The nigger didn t live that d lift his head But they got m They got m He lasted fourteen years too It was his cook boy Hatcheted m before breakfast An it s well I remember our second trip into the bush after what was left of m I saw his head after you d turned it over to the Commissioner at Tulagi Van Horn supplemented An the peaceful quiet everyday face of him on it with almost the same old smile I d seen a thousand times It dried on m that way over the smokin fire But they got m if it did take fourteen years There s manny s the head that goes to Malaita manny s the time untooken but like the old pitcher it s tooken in the end But I ve got their goat the captain insisted When trouble s hatching I go straight to them and tell them what They can t get the hang of it Think I ve got some powerful devil devil medicine Tom Haggin thrust out his hand in abrupt good bye resolutely keeping his eyes from dropping to Jerry in the other s arms Keep your eye on my return boys he cautioned as he went over the side till you land the last mother s son of m They ve got no cause to love Jerry or his breed an I d hate ill to happen m at a nigger s hands An in the dark of the night tis like as not he can do a fare you well overside Don t take your eye off m till you re quit of the last of m At sight of big Mister Haggin deserting him and being pulled away in the whaleboat Jerry wriggled and voiced his anxiety in a low whimpering whine Captain Van Horn snuggled him closer in his arm with a caress of his free hand Don t forget the agreement Tom Haggin called back across the widening water If aught happens you Jerry s to come back to me I ll make a paper to that same and put it with the ship s articles was Van Horn s reply Among the many words possessed by Jerry was his own name and in the talk of the two men he had recognised it repeatedly and he was aware vaguely that the talk was related to the vague and unguessably terrible thing that was happening to him He wriggled more determinedly and Van Horn set him down on the deck He sprang to the rail with more quickness than was to be expected of an awkward puppy of six months and not the quick attempt of Van Horn to cheek him would have succeeded But Jerry recoiled from the open water lapping the Arangi s side The taboo was upon him It was the image of the log awash that was not a log but that was alive luminous in his brain that checked him It was not reason on his part but inhibition which had become habit He plumped down on his bob tail lifted golden muzzle skyward and emitted a long puppy wail of dismay and grief It s all right Jerry old man brace up and be a man dog Van Horn soothed him But Jerry was not to be reconciled While this indubitably was a white skinned god it was not his god Mister Haggin was his god and a superior god at that Even he without thinking about it at all recognized that His Mister Haggin wore pants and shoes This god on the deck beside him was more like a black Not only did he not wear pants and was barefooted and barelegged but about his middle just like any black he wore a brilliant coloured loin cloth that like a kilt fell nearly to his sunburnt knees Captain Van Horn was a handsome man and a striking man although Jerry did not know it If ever a Holland Dutchman stepped out of a Rembrandt frame Captain Van Horn was that one despite the fact that he was New York born as had been his knickerbocker ancestors before him clear back to the time when New York was not New York but New Amsterdam To complete his costume a floppy felt hat distinctly Rembrandtish in effect perched half on his head and mostly over one ear a sixpenny white cotton undershirt covered his torso and from a belt about his middle dangled a tobacco pouch a sheath knife filled clips of cartridges and a huge automatic pistol in a leather holster On the beach Biddy who had hushed her grief lifted it again when she heard Jerry s wail And Jerry desisting a moment to listen heard Michael beside her barking his challenge and saw without being conscious of it Michael s withered ear with its persistent upward cock Again while Captain Van Horn and the mate Borckman gave orders and while the Arangi s mainsail and spanker began to rise up the masts Jerry loosed all his heart of woe in what Bob told Derby on the beach was the grandest vocal effort he had ever heard from any dog and that except for being a bit thin Caruso didn t have anything on Jerry But the song was too much for Haggin who as soon as he had landed whistled Biddy to him and strode rapidly away from the beach At sight of her disappearing Jerry was guilty of even more Caruso like effects which gave great joy to a Pennduffryn return boy who stood beside him He laughed and jeered at Jerry with falsetto chucklings that were more like the jungle noises of tree dwelling creatures half bird and half man than of a man all man and therefore a god This served as an excellent counter irritant Indignation that a mere black should laugh at him mastered Jerry and the next moment his puppy teeth sharp pointed as needles had scored the astonished black s naked calf in long parallel scratches from each of which leaped the instant blood The black sprang away in trepidation but the blood of Terrence the Magnificent was true in Jerry and like his father before him he followed up slashing the black s other calf into a ruddy pattern At this moment anchor broken out and headsails running up Captain Van Horn whose quick eye had missed no detail of the incident with an order to the black helmsman turned to applaud Jerry Go to it Jerry he encouraged Get him Shake him down Sick him Get him Get him The black in defence aimed a kick at Jerry who leaping in instead of away another inheritance from Terrence avoided the bare foot and printed a further red series of parallel lines on the dark leg This was too much and the black afraid more of Van Horn than of Jerry turned and fled for ard leaping to safety on top of the eight Lee Enfield rifles that lay on top of the cabin skylight and that were guarded by one member of the boat s crew About the skylight Jerry stormed leaping up and falling back until Captain Van Horn called him off Some nigger chaser that pup some nigger chaser Van Horn confided to Borckman as he bent to pat Jerry and give him due reward of praise And Jerry under this caressing hand of a god albeit it did not wear pants forgot for a moment longer the fate that was upon him He s a lion dog more like an Airedale than an Irish terrier Van Horn went on to his mate still petting Look at the size of him already Look at the bone of him Some chest that He s got the endurance And he ll be some dog when he grows up to those feet of his Jerry had just remembered his grief and was starting a rush across the deck to the rail to gaze at Meringe growing smaller every second in the distance when a gust of the South east Trade smote the sails and pressed the Arangi down And down the deck slanted for the moment to forty five degrees Jerry slipped and slid vainly clawing at the smooth surface for a hold He fetched up against the foot of the mizzenmast while Captain Van Horn with the sailor s eye for the coral patch under his bow gave the order Hard a lee Borckman and the black steersman echoed his words and as the wheel spun down the Arangi with the swiftness of a witch rounded into the wind and attained a momentary even keel to the flapping of her headsails and a shifting of headsheets Jerry still intent on Meringe took advantage of the level footing to recover himself and scramble toward the rail But he was deflected by the crash of the mainsheet blocks on the stout deck traveller as the mainsail emptied of the wind and feeling the wind on the other side swung crazily across above him He cleared the danger of the mainsheet with a wild leap although no less wild had been Van Horn s leap to rescue him and found himself directly under the mainboom with the huge sail looming above him as if about to fall upon him and crush him It was Jerry s first experience with sails of any sort He did not know the beasts much less the way of them but in his vivid recollection when he had been a tiny puppy burned the memory of the hawk in the middle of the compound that had dropped down upon him from out of the sky Under that colossal threatened impact he crouched down to the deck Above him falling upon him like a bolt from the blue was a winged hawk unthinkably vaster than the one he had encountered But in his crouch was no hint of cower His crouch was a gathering together an assembling of all the parts of him under the rule of the spirit of him for the spring upward to meet in mid career this monstrous menacing thing But the succeeding fraction of a moment so that Jerry leaping missed even the shadow of it the mainsail with a second crash of blocks on traveller had swung across and filled on the other tack Van Horn had missed nothing of it Before in his time he had seen young dogs frightened into genuine fits by their first encounters with heaven filling sky obscuring down impending sails This was the first dog he had seen leap with bared teeth undismayed to grapple with the huge unknown With spontaneity of
