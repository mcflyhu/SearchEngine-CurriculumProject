Come in Mr Bagley I said and bring the children I want to talk with you all Merton you go home with Junior But papa he objected Do as I bid you I said firmly and I entered the squalid abode The man and the children followed me wonderingly I sat down and looked the man steadily in the eye for a moment Let us settle one thing first I began Do you think I am afraid of you S pose not with sich backin as yer got was the somewhat nervous reply I told Mr Jones after I came home last night that I should fight this thing alone if no one stood by me But you see that your neighbors have reached the limit of forbearance Now Mr Bagley I didn t remain to threaten you There has been enough of that and from very resolute angry men too I wish to give you and yours a chance You ve come to a place where two roads branch you must take one or the other You can t help yourself You and your children won t be allowed to steal or prowl about any more That s settled If you go away and begin the same wretched life elsewhere you ll soon reach the same result you and your son will be lodged in jail and put at hard labor Would you not better make up your mind to work for yourself and family like an honest man Look at these children How are you bringing them up Take the road to the right Do your level best and I ll help you I ll let bygones be bygones and aid you in becoming a respectable citizen Oh Hank do be a man now that Mr Durham gives you a chance sobbed his wife you know we ve been living badly That s it Bagley These are the questions you must decide If you ll try to be a man I ll give you my hand to stand by you My religion such as it is requires that I shall not let a man go wrong if I can help it If you ll take the road to the right and do your level best there s my hand The man showed his emotion by a slight tremor only and after a moment s thoughtful hesitation he took my hand and said in a hoarse choking voice You ve got a claim on me now which all the rest couldn t git even if they put a rope around my neck I s pose I have lived like a brute but I ve been treated like one too If you ll do as I say I ll guarantee that within six months you ll be receiving all the kindness that a self respecting man wants I answered Then turning to his wife I asked What have you in the house to eat Next to nothin she said drying her eyes with her apron and then throwing open their bare cupboard Put on your coat Bagley and come with me I said He and his wife began to be profuse with thanks No no I said firmly I m not going to give you a penny s worth of anything while you are able to earn a living You shall have food at once but I shall expect you to pay for it in work I am going to treat you like a man and a woman and not like beggars A few minutes later some of the neighbors were much surprised to see Bagley and myself going up the road together My wife Merton and tender hearted Mousie were at the head of the lane watching for me Reassured as we approached they returned wonderingly to the house and met us at the door This is Mrs Durham I said My dear please give Mr Bagley ten pounds of flour and a piece of pork After you re had your dinner Mr Bagley I shall expect you as we ve agreed And if you ll chain up that dog of yours or better still knock it on the head with an axe Mrs Durham will go down and see your wife about fixing up your children Winifred gave me a pleased intelligent look and said Come in Mr Bagley while Merton and I hastened away to catch up with neglected work Your husband s been good to me said the man abruptly That s because he believes you are going to be good to yourself and your family was her smiling reply Will you come and see my wife he asked Certainly if I don t have to face your dog replied Winifred I ll kill the critter soon s I go home muttered Bagley It hardly pays to keep a big useless dog was my wife s practical comment In going to the cellar for the meat she left him alone for a moment or two with Mousie and he under his new impulses said Little gal ef my children hurt your flowers agin let me know and I ll thrash em The child stole to his side and gave him her hand as she replied Try being kind to them Bagley went home with some new ideas under his tattered old hat At half past twelve he was on hand ready for work That dog that tried to bite ye is dead and buried he said and I hope I buried some of my dog natur with im You ve shown your good sense But I haven t time to talk now The old man has mown a good deal of grass I want you to shake it out and as soon as he says it s dry enough to rake it up Toward night I ll be out with the wagon and we ll stow all that s fit into the barn To morrow I want your two eldest children to come and pick berries I m in fer it Mr Durham You ve given me your hand and I ll show yer how that goes furder with me than all the blood and thunder talk in Maizeville said Bagley with some feeling Then you ll show that you can be a man like the rest of us I said as I hastened to our early dinner My wife beamed and nodded at me I m not going to say anything to set you up too much she said You are great on problems and you are solving one even better than I hoped It isn t solved yet I replied We have only started Bagley and his people on the right road It will require much patience and good management to keep them there I rather think you ll have the hardest part of the problem yet on your hands I have little time for problems now however except that of making the most of this season of rapid growth and harvest I declare I m almost bewildered when I see how much there is to be done on every side Children we must all act like soldiers in the middle of a fight Every stroke must tell Now we ll hold a council of war so as to make the most of the afternoon s work Merton how are the raspberries There are more ripe papa than I thought there would be Then Winnie you and Bobsey must leave the weeding in the garden and help Merton pick berries this afternoon As soon as it gets cooler said my wife Mousie and I are going to pick also Very well I agreed You can give us raspberries and milk to night and so you will be getting supper at the same time Until the hay is ready to come in I shall keep on hoeing in the garden the weeds grow so rapidly Tomorrow will be a regular fruit day all around for there are two more cherry trees that need picking Our short nooning over we all went to our several tasks The children were made to feel that now was the chance to win our bread for months to come and that there must be no shirking Mousie promised to clear away the things while my wife protected by a large sun shade walked slowly down to the Bagley cottage Having seen that Merton and his little squad were filling the baskets with raspberries properly I went to the garden and slaughtered the weeds where they threatened to do the most harm At last I became so hot and wearied that I thought I would visit a distant part of the upland meadow and see how Bagley was progressing He was raking manfully and had accomplished a fair amount of work but it was evident that he was almost exhausted He was not accustomed to hard work and had rendered himself still more unfit for it by dissipation See here Bagley I said you are doing well but you will have to break yourself into harness gradually I don t wish to be hard upon you Lie down under this tree for half an hour and by that time I shall be out with the wagon Mr Durham you have the feelin s of a man for a feller said Bagley gratefully I ll make up the time arter it gets cooler Returning to the raspberry patch I found Bobsey almost asleep the berries often falling from his nerveless hands Merton meanwhile with something of the spirit of a martinet was spurring him to his task I remembered that the little fellow had been busy since breakfast and decided that he also of my forces should have a rest He started up when he saw me coming through the bushes and tried to pick with vigor again As I took him up in my arms he began apprehensively Papa I will pick faster but I m so tired I reassured him with a kiss which left a decided raspberry flavor on my lips carried him into the barn and tossing him on a heap of hay said Sleep there my little man till you are rested He was soon snoring blissfully and when I reached the meadow with the wagon Bagley was ready to help with the loading Well well he exclaimed a little breathin spell does do a feller good on a hot day No doubt about it I said So long as you are on the right road it does no harm to sit down a bit because when you start again it s in the right direction After we had piled on as much of a load as the rude extemporized rack on my market wagon could hold I added You needn t go to the barn with me for I can pitch the hay into the mow Rake up another load if you feel able Oh I m all right now he protested By the time I had unloaded the hay I found that my wife and Mousie were among the raspberries and that the number of full fragrant little baskets was increasing rapidly Winifred isn t this work with your walk to the Bagley cottage too much for you Oh no she replied lightly An afternoon in idleness in a stifling city flat would have been more exhausting It s growing cool now What wretched shiftless people those Bagleys are But I have hopes of them I m glad Bobsey s having a nap You shall tell me about your visit to night We are making good progress Bagley is doing his best Winnie I called come here She brought her basket nearly filled and I saw that her eyes were heavy with weariness also You ve done well to day my child Now go and look after your chickens big and little Then your day s work is done and you can do what you please and I started for the meadow again By six o clock we had in the barn three loads of hay and Merton had packed four crates of berries ready for market Bobsey was now running about as lively as a cricket and Winnie with a child s elasticity was nearly as sportive Bagley after making up his half hour came up the lane with a rake instead of his ugly dog as on the evening before A few moments later he helped me lift the crates into the market wagon and then after a little awkward hesitation began I say Mr Durham can t ye give a feller a job yerself I declar to you I want to brace up but I know how it ll be down at Rollins s He ll be savage as a meat axe to me and his men will be a gibin Give me a job yerself and I ll save enough out o my wages to pay for his chickens or you kin keep nuff back to pay for em I thought a moment and then said promptly I ll agree to this if Rollins will I ll see him to night Did yer wife go to see my wife Yes and she says she has hopes of you all You ve earned your bread to day as honestly as I have and you ve more than paid for what my wife gave you this morning Here s a quarter to make the day square and here s a couple of baskets of raspberries left over Take them to the children Well yer bring me right to the mark he said emphasizing his words with a slap on his thigh I ve got an uphill row to hoe and it s good ter have some human critters around that ll help a feller a bit I laughed as I clapped him on the shoulder and said You re going to win the fight Bagley I ll see Rollins at once for I find I shall need another man awhile Give me the job then he said eagerly and give me what you
