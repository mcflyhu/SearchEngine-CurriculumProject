There is to be a grand ball game next Sunday for the feast of Saint Damasus in the borough of Hasparitz Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho companions in continual expeditions through the surrounding country travelled for the entire day in the little wagon of the Detcharry family in order to organize that ball game which to them is a considerable event In the first place they had to consult Marcos one of the Iragola brothers Near a wood in front of his house in the shade they found him seated on a stump of a chestnut tree always grave and statuesque his eyes inspired and his gesture noble in the act of making his little brother still in swaddling clothes eat soup Is he the eleventh they have asked laughing Oh Go on the big eldest brother has replied the eleventh is running already like a hare in the heather This is number twelve little John the Baptist you know the latest who I think will not be the last And then lowering their heads not to strike the branches they had traversed the woods the forests of oaks under which extends infinitely the reddish lace of ferns And they have traversed several villages also Basque villages all grouped around these two things which are the heart of them and which symbolize their life the church and the ball game Here and there they have knocked at the doors of isolated houses tall and large houses carefully whitewashed with green shades and wooden balconies where are drying in the sun strings of red peppers At length they have talked in their language so closed to strangers of France with the famous players the titled champions the ones whose odd names have been seen in all the journals of the southwest on all the posters of Biarritz or of Saint Jean de Luz and who in ordinary life are honest country inn keepers blacksmiths smugglers with waistcoat thrown over the shoulder and shirt sleeves rolled on bronze arms Now that all is settled and that the last words have been exchanged it is too late to return that night to Etchezar then following their errant habits they select for the night a village which they like Zitzarry for example where they have gone often for their smuggling business At the fall of night then they turn toward this place which is near Spain They go by the same little Pyrenean routes shady and solitary under the old oaks that are shedding their leaves among slopes richly carpeted with moss and rusty ferns And now there are ravines where torrents roar and then heights from which appear on all sides the tall sombre peaks At first it was cold a real cold lashing the face and the chest But now gusts begin to pass astonishingly warm and perfumed with the scent of plants the southern wind rising again bringing back suddenly the illusion of summer And then it becomes for them a delicious sensation to go through the air so brusquely changed to go quickly under the lukewarm breaths in the noise of their horse s bells galloping playfully in the mountains Zitzarry a smugglers village a distant village skirting the frontier A dilapidated inn where according to custom the rooms for the men are directly above the stables the black stalls They are well known travelers there Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho and while men are lighting the fire for them they sit near an antique mullioned window which overlooks the square of the ball game and the church they see the tranquil little life of the day ending in this place so separated from the world On this solemn square the children practice the national game grave and ardent already strong they throw their pelota against the wall while in a singing voice and with the needful intonation one of them counts and announces the points in the mysterious tongue of the ancestors Around them the tall houses old and white with warped walls with projecting rafters contemplate through their green or red windows those little players so lithe who run in the twilight like young cats And the carts drawn by oxen return from the fields with the noise of bells bringing loads of wood loads of gorse or of dead ferns The night falls falls with its peace and its sad cold Then the angelus rings and there is in the entire village a tranquil prayerful meditation Then Ramuntcho silent worries about his destiny feels as if he were a prisoner here with his same aspirations always toward something unknown he knows not what which troubles him at the approach of night And his heart also fills up because he is alone and without support in the world because Gracieuse is in a situation different from his and may never be given to him But Arrochkoa very brotherly this time in one of his good moments slaps him on the shoulder as if he had understood his reverie and says to him in a tone of light gaiety Well it seems that you talked together last night sister and you she told me about it and that you are both prettily agreed Ramuntcho lifts toward him a long look of anxious and grave interrogation which is in contrast with the beginning of their conversation And what do you think he asks of what we have said Oh my friend replied Arrochkoa become more serious also on my word of honor it suits me very well And even as I fear that there shall be trouble with mother I promise to help you if you need help And Ramuntcho s sadness is dispelled as a little dust on which one has blown He finds the supper delicious the inn gay He feels himself much more engaged to Gracieuse now when somebody is in the secret and somebody in the family who does not repulse him He had a presentiment that Arrochkoa would not be hostile to him but his co operation so clearly offered far surpasses Ramuntcho s hope Poor little abandoned fellow so conscious of the humbleness of his situation that the support of another child a little better established in life suffices to return to him courage and confidence borough n He was slated for borough president That s what happened to Harry Barritt of London s Bromley borough wagon n We have to
