I remember little that followed until I was startled out of my chair by a loud knocking The sunlight was streaming in at the window and John Jones s voice was at the door I think we have all overslept I said as I admitted him Not a bit of it Every wink you ve had after such a day as yesterday is like money put in the bank But the sleighing is better now than it will be later in the day The sun ll be pretty powerful by noon and the snow ll soon be slush Now s your chance to get your traps up in a hurry I can have a two hoss sled ready in half an hour and if you say so I can hire a big sleigh of a neighbor and we ll have everything here by dinner time After you get things snug you won t care if the bottom does fall out of the roads for a time Well you HAVE had to rough it Merton might have come and stayed with us Oh I m all right said the boy rubbing his eyes open as he rose from the floor at the same time learning from stiff joints that a carpet is not a mattress Nothing would suit me better Mr Jones than your plan of prompt action and I m the luckiest man in the world in having such a long headed fore handed neighbor to start with I know you ll make a good bargain for the other team and before I sleep to night I wish to square up for everything I mean at least to begin business in this way at Maizeville Oh go slow go slow said Mr Jones The town will mob you if they find you ve got ready money in March John junior will be over with a pot of coffee and a jug of milk in a few minutes and we ll be off sharp There was a patter of feet overhead and soon Bobsey came tearing down half wild with excitement over the novelty of everything He started for the door as if he were going head first into the snow I caught him and said Do you see that chair Well we all have a busy day before us You can help a good deal and play a little but you can t hinder and pester according to your own sweet will one bit You must either obey orders or else be put under arrest and tied in the chair To go into the chair to day would be torture indeed and the little fellow was sobered at once The others soon joined us eager to see everything by the broad light of day and to enter upon the task of getting settled We had scarcely come together before John junior appeared with the chief features of our breakfast The children scanned this probable playmate very curiously and some of us could hardly repress a smile at his appearance He was even more sandy than his father Indeed his hair and eyebrows were nearly white but out of his red and almost full moon face his mother s black eyes twinkled shrewdly They now expressed only good will and bashfulness Every one of us shook hands with him so cordially that his boy s heart was evidently won Merton to break the ice more fully offered to show him his gun which he had kept within reach ever since we left the boat It made him feel more like a pioneer no doubt As he took it from its stout cloth cover I saw John junior s eyes sparkle Evidently a deep chord was touched He said excitedly To day s your time to try it A rabbit can t stir without leaving his tracks and the snow is so deep and soft that he can t get away There s rabbits on your own place O papa cried my boy fairly trembling with eagerness can t I go I need you very much this morning But papa others will be out before me and I may lose my chance and he was half ready to cry Yes I said there is a risk of that Well YOU shall decide in this case I added after a moment seeing a chance to do a little character building It is rarely best to put pleasure before business or prudence If you go out into the snow with those boots you will spoil them and very probably take a severe cold Yet you may go if you will If you help me we can be back by ten o clock and I will get you a pair of rubber boots as we return Will there be any chance after ten o clock he asked quickly Well said John junior in his matter of fact way that depends As your pa says there s a risk The temptation was too strong for the moment O dear exclaimed Merton I may never have so good a chance again The snow will soon melt and there won t be any more till next winter I ll tie my trousers down about my boots and I ll help all the rest of the day after I get back Very well I said quietly and he began eating his breakfast the abundant remains of our last night s lunch very rapidly while John junior started off to get his gun I saw that Merton was ill at ease but I made a sign to his mother not to interfere More and more slowly he finished his breakfast then took his gun and went to the room that would be his to load and prepare At last he came down and went out by another door evidently not wishing to encounter me John junior met him and the boys were starting when John senior drove into the yard and shouted John junior step here a moment The boy returned slowly Merton following You ain t said nothin to me about goin off with that gun continued Mr Jones severely Well Merton s pa said he might go if he wanted to and I had to go along to show him That first shot wasn t exactly straight my young friend John I told Merton that it wasn t best to put pleasure before business but that he could go if he would I wished to let him choose to do right instead of making him do right Oho that s how the land lays Well John junior you can have your choice too You may go right on with your gun but you know the length and weight of that strap at home Now will you help me or go after rabbits The boy grinned pleasantly and replied If you had said I couldn t go I wouldn t but if it s choosin between shootin rabbits and a strappin afterward come along Merton Well go along then chuckled his father you ve made your bargain square and I ll keep my part of it Oh hang the rabbits You shan t have any strapping on my account cried Merton and he carried his gun resolutely to his room and locked the door on it John junior quietly went to the old barn and hid his gun Guess I ll go with you pa he said joining us Ha ha ha laughed Mr Jones It was a good bargain to back out of Come now let s all be off as quick as we can Neighbor Rollins down the road will join us as we go along Merton I said see if there isn t a barrel of apples in the cellar If you find one you can fill your pockets He soon returned with bulging pockets and a smiling face feeling that such virtue as he had shown had soon brought reward My wife said that while we were gone she and the children would explore the house and plan how to arrange everything We started in good spirits Here s where you thought you was cast away last night Mr Jones remarked as we passed out of the lane The contrast made by a few short hours was indeed wonderful Then in dense obscurity a tempest had howled and shrieked about us now in the unclouded sunshine a gemmed and sparkling world revealed beauty everywhere For a long distance our sleighs made the first tracks and it seemed almost a pity to sully the purity of the white drift covered road What a lot of mud s hid under this snow was John Jones s prose over the opening vistas What s more it will show itself before night We can beat all creation at mud in Maizeville when once we set about it Merton laughed and munched his apples but I saw that he was impressed by winter scenery such as he had never looked upon before Soon however he and John junior were deep in the game question and I noted that the latter kept a sharp lookout along the roadside Before long while passing a thicket he shouted There s tracks and floundered out into the snow Merton following Oh come back growled his father Let the boys have a few moments I said They gave up this morning about as well as you could expect of boys Would Junior have gone and taken a strapping if Merton hadn t returned Yes indeed he would and he knows my strappin s are no make believe That boy has no sly mean tricks to speak of but he s as tough and obstinate as a mule sometimes especially about shooting and fishing See him now a p intin for that rabbit like a hound True enough the boy was showing good woodcraft Restraining Merton he cautiously approached the tracks which by reason of the lightness and depth of the snow were not very distinct He can t be far away said Junior excitedly Don t go too fast till I see which way he was a p intin We don t want to follow the tracks back but for ard See he came out of that old wall there he went to these bushes and nibbled some twigs and here he goes here he went here here yes he went into the wall again just here Now Merton watch this hole while I jump over the other side of the fence and see if he comes out again If he makes a start grab him John Jones and I were now almost as excited as the boys and Mr Rollins the neighbor who was following us was standing up in his sleigh to see the sport It came quickly As if by some instinct the rabbit believed Junior to be the more dangerous and made a break from the wall almost at Merton s feet with such swiftness and power as to dash by him like a shot The first force of its bound over it was caught by nature s trap snow too deep and soft to admit of rapid running John Jones soon proved that Junior came honestly by his passion for hunting In a moment he was floundering through the bushes with his son and Merton In such pursuit of game my boy had the advantage for he was as agile as a cat But a moment or two elapsed before he caught up with the rabbit and threw himself upon it then rose white as a snow man shouting triumphantly and holding the little creature aloft by its ears Never rate Junior for hunting again I said laughingly to Mr Jones He s a chip of the old block I rather guess he is my neighbor acknowledged with a grin I own up I used to be pretty hot on such larkin We all keep forgettin we was boys once As we rode on Merton was a picture of exultation and Junior was on the sharp lookout again His father turned on him and said Now look a here enough s as good as a feast I ll blindfold you if you don t let the tracks alone Mrs Durham wants her things so she can begin to live Get up there and a crack of the whip ended all further hopes on the part of the boys But they felt well repaid for coming and Merton assured Junior that he deserved half the credit for only he knew how to manage the hunt He Fell In Love With His Wife Allan Poe s stories wink
