It don t mean nothing Pollard hastened to assure Terry It don t mean a thing in the world except that she s a fool girl The queerest orneriest kindest strangest wildest thing in the shape of calico that ever come into these parts since her mother died before her But the more you see of her the more you ll value her She can ride like a man no wear out to her and she s got the courage of a man Besides which she can sling a gun like it would do your heart good to see her Don t take nothing she does to heart She don t mean no harm But she sure does tangle up a gent s ideas Here I been living with her nigh onto twenty years and I don t savvy her none yet Eh boys I m not offended in the least said Terry quietly And he was not but he was more interested than he had ever been before by man woman or child And for the past few seconds his mind had been following her through the door behind which she had disappeared And if I were to see more of her no doubt He broke off with But I m not apt to see much more of any of you Mr Pollard If I can t stay here and work off that three hundred dollar debt Work hell No son of Black Jack Hollis can work for me But he can live with me as a partner son and he can have everything I got half and half and the bigger half to him if he asks for it That s straight Terry raised a protesting hand Yet he was touched intimately touched He had tried hard to fit in his place among the honest people of the mountains by hard and patient work They would have none of him His own kind turned him out And among these men men who had no law as he had every reason to believe he was instantly taken in and made one of them But no more talk tonight said Pollard I can see you re played out I ll show you the room He caught a lantern from the wall as he spoke and began to lead the way up the stairs to the balcony He pointed out the advantages of the house as he spoke Not half bad this house eh he said proudly And who d you think planned it Your old man kid It was Black Jack Hollis himself that done it He was took off sudden before he d had a chance to work it out and build it But I used his ideas in this the same s I ve done in other things His idea was a house like a ship They build a ship in compartments eh Ship hits a rock water comes in But it only fills one compartment and the old ship still floats Same with this house You seen them walls And the walls on the outside ain t the only thing Every partition is the same thing pretty near and a gent could stand behind these doors safe as if he was a mile away from a gun Why Because they s a nice little lining of the best steel you ever seen in the middle of em Cost a lot Sure But look at us now Suppose a posse was to rush the house They bust into the kitchen side Where are they Just the same as if they hadn t got in at all I bolt the doors from the inside of the big room and they re shut out agin Or suppose they take the big room Then a couple of us slide out on this balcony and spray em with lead This house ain t going to be took till the last room is filled full of the sheriff s men He paused on the balcony and looked proudly over the big baronial room below them It seemed huger than ever from this viewpoint and the men below them were dwarfed The light of the lanterns did not extend all the way across it but fell in pools here and there gleaming faintly on the men below But doesn t it make people suspicious to have a fort like this built on the hill asked Terry Of course If they knew But they don t know son and they ain t going to find out the lining of this house till they try it out with lead He brought Terry into one of the bedrooms and lighted a lamp As the flare steadied in the big circular oil burner and the light spread Terry made out a surprisingly comfortable apartment There was not a bunk but a civilized bed beside which was a huge tawny mountain lion skin softening the floor The window was curtained in some pleasant blue stuff and there were a few spots of color on the wall only calendars some of them but helping to give a livable impression for the place Kate s work grinned Pollard proudly She s been fixing these rooms up all out of her own head Never got no ideas out of me Anything you might lack son Terry told him he would be very comfortable and the big man wrung his hand again as he bade him good night The best work that Denver ever done was bringing you to me he declared Which you ll find it out before I m through I m going to give you a home And he strode away before Terry could answer The rather rare consciousness of having done a good deed swelled in the heart of Joe Pollard on his way down from the balcony When he reached the floor below he found that the four men had gone to bed and left Denver alone drawn back from the light into a shadowy corner where he was flanked by the gleam of a bottle of whisky on the one side and a shimmering glass on the other Although Pollard was the nominal leader he was in secret awe of the yegg For Denver was an in and outer Sometimes he joined them in the West sometimes he worked an Eastern territory He came and went as he pleased and was more or less a law to himself Moreover he had certain qualities of silence and brooding that usually disturbed the leader They troubled him now as he approached the squat shapeless figure in the corner chair What you think of him said Denver A good kid and a clean cut kid decided Joe Pollard judicially Maybe he ain t another Black Jack but he s tolerable cool for a youngster Stood up and looked me in the eye like a man when I had him cornered a while back Good thing for him you come out when you did A good thing for you Joe replied Denver Pete He d of turned you into fertilizer bo Maybe maybe not Maybe they s some things I could teach him about gun slinging Pete Maybe maybe not parodied Denver You ve learned a good deal about guns Joe quite a bit But there s some things about gun fighting that nobody can learn It s got to be born into em Remember how Black Jack used to slide out his gat Yep There was a man And Minter too There s a born gunman Sure We all know Uncle Joe damn his soul But the kid beat Uncle Joe fair and square from an even break and beat him bad Made his draw held it so s Joe could partway catch up with him and then drilled him clean Pollard scratched his chin I d believe that if I seen it he declared Pal it wasn t Terry that done the talking it was Gainor He s seen a good deal of gunplay and said that Terry s was the coolest he ever watched All right for that part of it said Joe Pollard Suppose he s fast but can I use him I like him well enough I ll give him a good deal but is he going to mean charity all the time he hangs out with me Maybe maybe not chuckled Denver again Use him the way he can be used and he ll be the best bargain you ever turned Black Jack started you in business Black Jack the Second will make you rich if you handle him right and ruin you if you make a slip How come He talks this honesty talk pretty strong Gimme a chance to talk said Denver contemptuously Takes a gent that s used to reading the secrets of a safe to read the secrets of a gent s head And I ve read the secret of young Black Jack Hollis He s a pile of dry powder Joe Throw in the spark and he ll explode so damned loud they ll hear him go off all over the country How First you got to keep him here How Joe Pollard sat back with the air of one who will be convinced through no mental effort of his own But Denver was equal to the demand I m going to show you He thinks he owes you three hundred That s foolish I cheated the kid out of it I ll give it back to him and all the rest I won Denver paused and studied the other as one amazed by such stupidity Pal did you ever try in the old days to give anything to the old Black Jack H m Well he sure hated charity But this ain t charity It ain t in your eyes It is in Terry s If you insist he ll get sore No Joe Let him think he owes you that money Let him start in working it off for you honest work You ain t got any ranch work Well set him to cutting down trees or anything That ll help to hold him If he makes some gambling play and he s got the born gambler in him you got one last thing that ll be apt to keep him here What s that Kate Pollard stirred in his chair How d you mean that he asked gruffly I mean what I said retorted Denver I watched young Black Jack looking at her He had his heart in his eyes the kid did He likes her in spite of the frosty mitt she handed him Oh he s falling for her pal and he ll keep on falling Just slip the word to Kate to kid him along Will you And after we got him glued to the place here we ll figure out the way to turn Terry into a copy of his dad We ll figure out how to shoot the spark into the powder and then stand clear for the explosion Denver came silently and swiftly out of the chair his pudgy hand spread on the table and his eyes gleaming close to the face of Pollard Joe he said softly if that kid goes wrong he ll be as much as his father ever was and maybe more He ll rake in the money like it was dirt How do I know Because I ve talked to him I ve watched him and trailed him He s trying hard to go straight He s failed twice the third time he ll bust and throw in with us And if he does he ll clean up the coin and we ll get our share Why ain t you made more money yourself Joe You got as many men as Black Jack ever had It s because you ain t got the fire in you Neither have I We re nothing but tools ready for another man to use the way Black Jack used us Nurse this kid along a little while and he ll show us how to pry open the places where the real coin is cached away And he ll lead us in and out with no danger to us and all the real risk on his own head That s his way that was his dad s way before him Pollard nodded slowly Maybe you re right I know I am He s a gold mine this kid is But we got to buy him with something more than gold And I know what that something is I m going to show him that the good lawabiding citizens have made up their minds that he s no good that they re all ag in him and when he finds that out he ll go wild They ain t no doubt of it He ll show his teeth And when he shows his teeth he ll taste blood they ain t no doubt of it Going to make him kill asked Pollard very softly Why not He ll do it sooner or later anyway It s in his blood I suppose it is I got an idea There s a young gent in town named Larrimer ain t there Sure A rough kid too It was him that killed Kennedy last spring And he s proud of his reputation Sure He d go a hundred miles to have a fight with a gent with a good name for gunplay Then hark to me sing Joe Send Terry into town to get something for you I ll drop in ahead of him and find Larrimer and tell Larrimer that Black Jack s son is around the man that dropped Sheriff Minter Then I ll bring em together and give em a running start And risk Terry getting his head blown off If he can t beat Larrimer he s no use to us if he kills Larrimer it s good riddance The kid is going to get bumped off sometime anyway He s bad all the way through Pollard looked with a sort of wonder on his companion You re a nice kind sort of a gent ain t you Denver I m a moneymaker asserted Denver coldly And just now Terry Hollis is my gold mine Watch me work him sling vt n The boy
