Eight o clock in the evening They have dined at the cider mill all the players except the vicar under the patronage of Itchoua they have lounged for a long time afterward languid in the smoke of smuggled cigarettes and listening to the marvellous improvisations of the two Iragola brothers of the Mendiazpi mountain while outside on the street the girls in small groups holding one another s arms looked at the windows found pleasure in observing on the smoky panes the round shadows of the heads of the men covered with similar caps Now on the square the brass band plays the first measures of the fandango and the young men the young girls all those of the village and several also of the mountain who have remained to dance arrive in impatient groups There are some dancing already on the road not to lose anything And soon the fandango turns turns in the light of the new moon the horns of which seem to pose lithe and light on the enormous and heavy mountain In the couples that dance without ever touching each other there is never a separation before one another always and at an equal distance the boy and the girl make evolutions with a rhythmic grace as if they were tied together by some invisible magnet It has gone into hiding the crescent of the moon fallen one would think in the black mountain then lanterns are brought and hooked to the trunks of the plane trees and the young men can see better their partners who opposite them swing with an air of fleeing continually but without increasing their distance ever almost all pretty their hair elegantly dressed a kerchief on the neck and wearing with ease gowns in the fashion of to day The men somewhat grave always accompany the music with snaps of their fingers in the air shaven and sunburnt faces to which labor in the fields in smuggling or at sea has given a special thinness almost ascetic still by the ampleness of their brown necks by the width of their shoulders one divines their great strength the strength of that old sober and religious race The fandango turns and oscillates to the tune of an ancient waltz All the arms extended and raised agitate themselves in the air rise or fall with pretty cadenced motions following the oscillations of bodies The rope soled sandals make this dance silent and infinitely light one hears only the frou frou of gowns and ever the snap of fingers imitating the noise of castanets With a Spanish grace the girls whose wide sleeves expand like wings swing their tightened waists above their vigorous and supple hips Facing one another Ramuntcho and Gracieuse said nothing at first captivated by the childish joy of moving quickly in cadence to the sound of music It is very chaste that manner of dancing without the slightest touch of bodies But there were also in the course of the evening waltzes and quadrilles and even walks arm in arm during which the lovers could touch each other and talk Then my Ramuntcho said Gracieuse it is of that game that you expect to make your future is it not They were walking now arm in arm under the plane trees shedding their leaves in the night of November lukewarm as a night of May during an interval of silence when the musicians were resting Yes replied Ramuntcho in our country it is a trade like any other where one may earn a living as long as strength lasts and one may go from time to time to South America you know as Irun and Gorosteguy have done and bring back twenty thirty thousand francs for a season earned honestly at Buenos Ayres Oh the Americas exclaimed Gracieuse in a joyful enthusiasm the Americas what happiness It was always my wish to go across the sea to those countries And we would look for your uncle Ignacio then go to my cousin Bidegaina who has a farm on the Uruguay in the prairies She ceased talking the little girl who had never gone out of that village which the mountains enclose she stopped to think of these far off lands which haunted her young head because she had like most Basques nomadic ancestors folks who are called here Americans or Indians who pass their adventurous lives on the other side of the ocean and return to the cherished village only very late to die And while she dreamed her nose in the air her eyes in the black of the clouds and of the summits Ramuntcho felt his blood running faster his heart beating quicker in the intense joy of what she had just said so spontaneously And inclining his head toward her he asked as if to jest in a voice infinitely soft and childish We would go Is that what you said we would go you with me This signifies therefore that you would consent a little later when we become of age to marry me He perceived through the darkness the gentle black light of Gracieuse s eyes which rose toward him with an expression of astonishment and of reproach Then you did not know I wanted to make you say it you see You had never said it to me do you know He held tighter the arm of his little betrothed and their walk became slower It is true that they had never said it not only because it seemed to them that it was not necessary to say but especially because they were stopped at the moment of speaking by a sort of terror the terror of being mistaken about each other s sentiment and now they knew they were sure Then they had the consciousness of having passed together the grave and solemn threshold of life And leaning on one another they faltered almost in their slackened promenade like two children intoxicated by youthfulness joy and hope But do you think your mother will consent said Ramuntcho timidly after the long delightful silence Ah that is the trouble replied the little girl with a sigh of anxiety Arrochkoa my brother will be for us it is probable But mother Will mother consent But it will not happen soon in any case You have to serve in the army No if you do not want me to No I need not serve I am a Guipuzcoan like my mother I shall be enrolled only if I wish to be Whatever you say I ll do My Ramuntcho I would like better to wait for you longer and that you become naturalized and that you become a soldier like the others I tell you this since you ask Truly is it what you wish Well so much the better Oh to be a Frenchman or a Spaniard is indifferent to me I shall do as you wish I like as well one as the other I am a Basque like you like all of us I care not for the rest But as for being a soldier somewhere on this side of the frontier or on the other yes I prefer it In the first place one who goes away looks as if he were running away and then it would please me to be a soldier frankly Well my Ramuntcho since it is all the same to you serve as a soldier in France to please me It is understood Gatchutcha You will see me wearing red trousers I shall call on you in the dress of a soldier like Bidegarray like Joachim As soon as I have served my three years we will marry if your mother consents After a moment of silence Gracieuse said in a low solemn voice Listen my Ramuntcho I am like you I am afraid of her of my mother But listen if she refuses we shall do together anything anything that you wish for this is the only thing in the world in which I shall not obey her Then silence returned between them now that they were engaged the incomparable silence of young joys of joys new and not yet tried which need to hush which need to meditate in order to understand themselves better in their profoundness They walked in short steps and at random toward the church in the soft obscurity which the lanterns troubled no longer intoxicated by their innocent contact and by feeling that they were walking together in the path where no one had followed them But the noise of the brass instruments suddenly arose anew in a sort of slow waltz oddly rhythmic And the two children at the fandango s appeal without having consulted each other and as if it was a compulsory thing which may not be disputed ran not to lose a moment toward the place where the couples were dancing Quickly quickly placing themselves opposite each other they began again to swing in measure without talking to each other with the same pretty gestures of their arms the same supple motions of their hips From time to time without loss of step or distance both ran in a direct line like arrows But this was only an habitual variation of the dance and ever in measure quickly as if they were gliding they returned to their starting point Gracieuse had in dancing the same passionate ardor as in praying at the white chapels the same ardor which later doubtless she would have in embracing Ramuntcho when caresses between them would not be forbidden And at moments at every fifth or sixth measure at the same time as her light and strong partner she turned round completely the bust bent with Spanish grace the head thrown backward the lips half open on the whiteness of the teeth a distinguished and proud grace disengaging itself from her little personality still so mysterious which to Ramuntcho only revealed itself a little During all this beautiful evening of November they danced before each other mute and charming with intervals of promenade in which they hardly talked intoxicated in silence by the delicious thought with which their minds were filled And until the curfew rang in the church this dance under the branches of autumn these little lanterns this little festival in this corner closed to the world threw a little light and joyful noise into the vast night which the mountains standing everywhere like giants of shadow made more dumb and more black
