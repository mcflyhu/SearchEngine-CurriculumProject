Eric stayed nearly eight weeks instead of three Yet I let him go away without a word about the radical change that had come over a life outwardly the same That was the year I was eighteen But I still did lessons with my mother French and German and English history I asked her to let me leave off history and allow me to work by myself a little I wanted to surprise her by and by so she was not to question me I studied a great deal harder than she knew When we sat down to breakfast at half past eight I would usually have three hours of work behind me Often when Bettina and I were both supposed to be at the Helmstones I had stayed behind in the copse to read This would be when I knew Ranny Dallas was not at the Hall I still thought that like all the other young men who came there he was attracted by Hermione But I could not forget that Bettina liked[Pg ] him best liked him more than the man she had allowed to kiss her and who had not cared for her at all I did my best to make Betty see that even if a man as young as Ranny Dallas were to think of marrying at present it would be the Hermione sort of person he would think of For we knew that since his elder brother s death a great deal was expected of Ranny All that I could get out of Betty just then was that he was not so young as he looked But I heard presently that he had told her he was chucking the army His father was growing feeble and wanted his son to settle down and nurse the family constituency I remember how annoyed Betty was at my saying that whether Ranny was old enough to think of marrying or not I certainly couldn t imagine such a boy being a Member of Parliament Betty quoted Hermione Hermione who knew much more about such things than I did had said she was sure that Ranny would get into the House at the very next by election And Hermione had clinched this by adding Ranny Dallas always gets everything he wants [Pg ] I made up my mind that for Betty s sake I must keep my eyes open All that I had seen in him so far was a fair rather chubby young man who was not really very good looking but who somehow made the impression of being so chiefly I think because he looked so extraordinarily clean And he had that smile which makes people feel that the world must be a nicer place than they had thought Then too there was something rather nice in the way his hair simply would curl in wet weather for all the plastering down His round blunt featured face was clean shaven and if I had wanted to tease Ranny I should have told him I was sure he hadn t long got over dimples But Betty was right he was older than he looked I tried to be with her whenever he was about But this became more and more difficult For often he came down without any warning If they couldn t have him at the Hall he would put up at the inn And he seemed quite as content walking those two miles to the links or clanking up and down the hilly road on a ramshackle bicycle he had found at the inn Our jobbing gardener was overheard to say that he wouldn t be seen riding[Pg ] such a bicycle no not on a dark night Ranny as we knew had two motor cars of his own and was very particular about their every detail But he said all that the much abused bike needed was a brake Even without a brake it was a lot better he said than having to think about the shover chap After all whether Ranny was nominally at the inn or staying with the Helmstones he spent most of his time with them and for all I could do he spent a good deal of the time with Bettina I still couldn t make up my mind whether he amused himself more with her or with Hermione But there was no doubt in Lord Helmstone s mind He used to chaff Hermione when Ranny wasn t there and when he was there Ranny got the chaffing What you here again his lordship would say Why I thought you d only just gone Then he d ask with a business like briskness what he d come for Why to play a game o golf with your lordship Can t think what a boy of your age is doing with golf Then he would say to us Here s[Pg ] a fella usen t to care a doit for golf and now this passion When Lord Helmstone said that which in the way of facetious persons secure from criticism he did a great many times a colour like a girl s would sometimes overspread Ranny s face in spite of the implication being so little of a novelty Then Lord Helmstone would call attention to Ranny s being very sunburnt and he would chuckle and rattle his keys You ought to run away and play cricket Eh In this weather Well go deer stalking then Or play polo Something more suitable to your years than pottering about golf links Something vigorous Keep down superfluous tissue Eh what People liked teasing Ranny He took it so charmingly When I admitted that much to Betty she said he did take chaffing well but she sometimes thought he got more than his share Lord Helmstone she said never ventured to treat Mr Annan in that way I said that was quite different and we very[Pg ] nearly had a serious quarrel When I saw that Betty really couldn t see the vast difference between making fun of that boy and making fun of a man like Eric Annan I began to feel more anxious than ever about Betty This was the first year the Helmstones kept Christmas in the South They filled the great house full to overflowing for a dance on New Year s Eve We had only our white muslin summer frocks to wear But not even Bettina minded and we had a most heavenly time Hermione had taught us the new dances She said she never in all her born days knew anybody so quick as Bettina at learning a new step Even I danced every dance and Bettina had to cut some of hers in two There were several new young men in the house party Two were brothers and both sailors The oldest one danced better than any man we had ever seen and he would have liked to dance with Bettina the whole night long It was our first ball and Betty was only sixteen So perhaps it was not very strange that the music and the motion and all the admiration went to Betty s head For she did behave[Pg ] rather badly to Ranny When she had danced three times with the oldest sailor Captain Gerald Boyne Ranny took her into a corner and remonstrated I saw he looked pretty serious but I didn t know till she and I were undressing in our own room that night or rather morning I didn t know how strongly he had spoken We had found our mother waiting for us and we were both a little remorseful for being so late when we saw how tired she looked But you know we asked you if we might stay to the end Then I told her they had all begged us to wait for one or two more dances after the musicians went away and how a friend of Lady Helmstone s played waltzes for us My mother thought it a pity to keep London hours in the country We were to get to bed now as quickly as possible and tell her all about it in the morning So we took the candle and went away to our own room It suddenly looked different to me this room Bettina and I had shared all our lives The ceiling seemed to have dropped a foot But all the same it looked very white and kind in the dim light Bettina ran and pulled back one of the[Pg ] dimity curtains Yes the moon was brighter than ever Betty threw open the window and leaned out Oh what a pity to go to bed when the world was looking like this We had had a green Christmas and the wind that blew in was not cold but I thought how horrified my mother would be to see Betty leaning out of a window in January with the night wind blowing on her neck We quarrelled a little very softly about shutting the window Bettina was still flushed and a good deal excited Rather anxious too about what had happened at the ball But she defended herself She overdid her air of justification such perfect nonsense Ranny s making all that fuss just because a person naturally likes to waltz with a man who dances so divinely I asked what precisely Ranny had said Oh he said he had hoped I would care to dance with him And of course I said I did I had already given him the first polka and I had promised him She broke off Nobody had ever been quite so reasonable as she or so unreasonable as Ranny He had tried to prevent her dancing at all with Captain Boyne [Pg ] But you had already danced three times with Captain Boyne I reminded her Well what of that she demanded in a quite un Betty like way And instead of undressing she followed me about the room her cheeks very bright as she told me how that unreasonable Ranny had kept saying that he made a point of it Then my partner for the mazurka came and I saw Ranny go over to you What did he say she asked so eagerly that she forgot to keep her voice down My mother knocked on the wall Go to sleep children she called We both answered Yes and I began hurriedly to undo Betty s gown But she never stopped twisting her head round Go on tell me What did he say I told her a little impatiently that he hadn t said anything in particular he hadn t tried to make himself the least agreeable and he danced badly Danced badly said Bettina as though it were quite a new idea I think that must have been your fault He dances quite well with me [Pg ] Yes I admitted he does dance best with you Then she told of the part Hermione had played Nothing escaped Hermione and as soon as she got wind of what was happening she egged Betty on Hermione had laughed out in the most meaning way when she saw Ranny coming towards Betty in the interval with blood in his eye as she expressed it She whispered to Betty that Ranny was far too used to having his own way But you ll see you ll have to give in Hermione said and went off laughing just as Ranny came up And he began badly You ve told Boyne he can t have this waltz Betty said No Why not Why haven t you told him He would ask for a reason Very well give it I don t know any reason Betty said The reason is Then he stopped and seemed to change his mind He began again The reason is you are going to sit out with me And then Betty ended nervously Gerald Boyne came and we waltzed that time too [Pg ] Yes I said severely everybody was saying Those two again And I didn t see you dance with Ranny at all after that No but it wasn t her fault It was quite understood he was to have the cotillion Then it was very wrong of you to dance the cotillion with Captain Boyne It was making yourself conspicuous She protested again that it wasn t her fault I kept them all waiting as it was You saw how I kept them waiting for Ranny till everyone was furious And as he didn t come I had to dance with whoever was there I suppose what made him angry was my going off for that horrid waltz after he had said he made a point of it I wasn t to dance again with that fellow And then what do you think I said Bettina took hold of my arm so I couldn t go on braiding my hair I said he was jealous of Captain Boyne or why should he call him that fellow Even at the moment I felt how horrid that was of me for it s not a bit like Ranny to be jealous in a horrid way calling people fellows So I said If the Boynes aren t nice why are they here And Ranny said Oh [Pg ] Gerald Boyne s people are all right His brother is all right But I shouldn t want you to dance with Gerald if you were my sister And if you were my wife I should forbid it But I said I m not your sister Betty tossed her head laughing softly and I m not your wife I asked her if she had said it like that Yes she had And I said too I said it was fortunate Then without the least warning poor Betty sat down on the foot of her bed and began to cry I put my arm round her And she pulled her bare shoulders away You needn t think I m crying about Ranny she said I suppose it s being so angry makes me cry You are crying because you are over tired I said and I began to take off her shoes and stockings I m not crying because I m tired but because she wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her nightgown it s a disappointment to see anyone so silly making points of such things as waltzes When she was ready for bed she stood meditating[Pg ] a moment And then Ranny has never struck me as one of the horrid unforgiving sort of people Has he you Oh no I said and I made her get into bed I covered her up But it was no use she threw back the eiderdown and sat bolt upright asking me like that at a ball if I liked Captain Boyne best a man I d never seen before don t you call it very rude No only a little foolish Another knock on the communicating door If you children keep on talking I shall have to come in We promised we wouldn t say another word But more than once Betty began Ranny Sh I said The quarrel about the window had ended in our leaving it a couple of inches open and the curtains looped back As we lay there the room grew brighter so bright that every little treasure on the long narrow shelf above each bed could be plainly seen All the small vases and pictures and china animals all the odds and ends we had cherished most since we were babies When Bettina had come in that night the first[Pg ] thing she did was to clear a space for her cotillion favours The moonlight showed the brilliant huddle of fan and bonbon basket tied with rose colour and most conspicuous of all the silver horn hung with parti coloured ribbons When we had lain quiet in our beds for ten minutes or so Bettina pulled out a pillow from under her head and propped it so that the moon couldn t shine any longer on the be ribboned horn And neither could Betty s eyes rest on it any more She lay still for some time and I was falling asleep when I heard her bed creak She had pulled herself half out of the covers and was leaning over the pillow barrier She took the horn and the other favours one by one and with much gravity thrust them under the bed A sigh of satisfaction and a settling down again I turned and smiled into my pillow It was so exactly the sort of thing Bettina used to do when she was in the nursery punishing her toys when things went
