Eve came down to breakfast in the panelled dining room at Rock Cottage and stood at one of the open windows watching an Aberdeen puppy demolishing an old shoe in the middle of the lawn The grass had been mown the day before and the two big borders on the near side of the yew hedge were full of colour chiefly the blues of delphiniums and the rose and white of giant stocks Nearer still were two rose beds planted with the choicest hybrid teas and mauve and yellow violas The rock garden beyond the yew hedge had lost some of its May gorgeousness but the soft tints of its rocks and the greys and greens of the foliage were very restful to the eyes Above it hung the blue curtain of a rare June day Billy you bad boy come here The puppy growled vigorously and worried the shoe up and down the lawn Oh you baby You have got to grow up into a responsible dog and look after my house She laughed just because she was happy and kneeling on the window seat began a flirtation with Master Billy who was showing off like any small boy Now I m sure I m more interesting than that shoe A bright eye twinkled at her I suppose it is very wrong of me to let you gnaw slippers I am sure Mrs Baxter is harder hearted But you are so young little Billy and too soon you will be old The door opened and a large woman with a broad and comfortable face sailed in with a tray Good morning miss Good morning Mrs Baxter Whose shoe has Billy got I m thinking it s one of mine miss The wretch I gave it him miss It s only an old one Eve s eyes glimmered Oh Mrs Baxter how very immoral of you I thought Billy s education would be safe with you There miss he s only a puppy But think of our responsibilities I wouldn t give tuppence for a boy or a puppy as had no mischief in him miss But think of the whackings afterwards I don t think it does no harm I ve no sympathy with the mollycoddles I do hold with a boy getting a good tanning regular If he deserves it it s all right If he s too goody to deserve it he ought to get it for not deserving of it Eve laughed and Mrs Baxter put the tea pot and a dish of sardines on toast on the table She was a local product and an excellent one at that and being a widow had been glad of a home I ve made you the China tea miss And the telephone man he wants to know when he can come and fix the hinstrument Any time this morning Thank you miss The panelled room was full of warm yellow light and Eve sat down at the gate legged table with a sense of organic and spiritual well being There were roses on the table and her sensitive mouth smiled at them expressively In one corner stood her easel an old mahogany bureau held her painting kit palettes brushes tubes boards canvases It was delightful to think that she could put on her sun hat wander out into the great gardens and express herself in all the colours that she loved Lynette s glowing head would come dancing to her in the sunlight The Wilderness was still a fairy world where mortals dreamed dreams There were letters beside her plate One was from Canterton who had gone north to plan a rich manufacturer s new garden She had not seen him since that drive to London for he had been away when she had arrived at Rock Cottage to settle the furniture and begin her new life with Mrs Baxter and the puppy She read Canterton s letter first Carissima I shall be back to morrow early as I stayed in town for a night Perhaps I shall find you at work It would please me to discover you in the rosery I am going to place Guinevere among the saints and each year I shall keep St Guinevere s feast day I hope everything pleases you at the cottage I purposely left the garden in an unprejudiced state It may amuse you to carry out your own ideas A rivederci She smiled Yes she would go and set up her easel in the rosery and be ready to enter with him upon their spiritual marriage Under a furniture dealer s catalogue lay a pamphlet in a wrapper with the address typed Eve slit the wrapper and found that she held in her hand an anti suffrage pamphlet written by Gertrude Canterton She was a little surprised not having heard as yet a full account of that most quaint and original of interviews But she read the pamphlet while she ate her toast and there was a glimmer of light in her eyes that told of amusement A woman s sphere is the home A woman who is busy with her children is busy according to Nature No sensible person can have any sympathy with those restless and impertinent gadabouts who thrust themselves into activities for which they are not suited Sex forbids certain things to women The eternal feminine is a force to be cherished Woman is the sympathiser the comforter She is the other beam of the balance She should strive to be opposite to man not like him A sweet influence in the home something that is dear and sacred Eve asked herself how Gertrude Canterton could write like this It was so extraordinarily lacking in self knowledge and suggested the old tale of the preacher put up to preach the preacher who omitted to do the things he advocated because he was so busy telling other people what they should do How was it that Gertrude Canterton never saw her real self How did she contrive to live with theories and to forget Lynette Yet in reading the pamphlet Eve carried Gertrude Canterton s contentions to their logical conclusion Motherhood and all that it means is the natural business of woman Therefore motherhood should be cherished as it has never yet been cherished Therefore every healthy woman should be permitted to have a child And here Eve folded up the pamphlet abruptly and pushed it away across the table After breakfast she went into the garden played with Billy for five minutes and then wandered to and fro and up and down the stone paths of the rock garden There were scores of rare plants all labelled but the labels were turned so that the names were hidden Eve had been less than a week in the cottage but from the very first evening she had put herself to school to learn the names of all these rock plants After three days work she had been able to reverse the labels and to go round tagging long names to various diminutive clumps of foliage and flowers and only now and again had she to stretch out a hand and look at a label All that was feminine and expressive in her opened to the sun that morning She went in about nine and changed her frock putting on a simple white dress with a low cut collar that showed her throat Looking in her mirror with the tender carefulness of a woman who is beloved it pleased her to think that she needed one fleck of colour a red rosebud over the heart She touched her dark hair with her fingers and smiled mysteriously into her own eyes She knew that she was ambitious that her pride in her comrade challenged the pride in herself His homage should not be fooled It was a splendid spur this love of his and the glow at her heart warmed all that was creative and compassionate in her This very cottage betrayed how his thoughts had worked for her A big cupboard recessed behind the oak panelling held several hundred books the books she needed in her work and the books that he knew would please her There was a little studio built out at the back of the cottage but he had left it bare for her own self to do with it what she pleased It was this restraint this remembering of her individuality that delighted her He had given her so much but not everything because he had realised that it is a rare pleasure to a working woman to spend her money in accumulating the things that she desires On her way through the plantations she met Lavender and she and Lavender were good friends The enthusiast in him approved of Eve She had eyes to see and she did not talk the woolly stuff that he associated with most women Her glimpses of beauty were not adjectival but sharp and clear cut proof positive that she saw the things that she pretended to see He offered to carry her easel and she accepted the offer Have you seen those Japanese irises in the water garden Miss Carfax Yes I am going to paint them this afternoon Whose idea was it massing that golden alyssum and blue lithospermum on the rocks behind them It s a touch of genius Lavender s nose curved when he smiled That was one of my flashes It looks good doesn t it One of the things that make you catch your breath He swung along with his hawk s profile in the air I fancy we re going to do some big things in the future If I were a rich man and wanted the finest garden in England I d give Mr Canterton a free hand And excuse me saying it miss but I m glad you ve joined us He gave her a friendly glare from a dark and apprizing eye I m keen keen as blazes and I wouldn t work with people who didn t care Mr Canterton showed me those pictures of yours I should like to have them to look at in the winter when everything s lying brown and dead If you want to know anything Miss Carfax at any time I m at your service His manners were of the quaintest but she understood him that he was above jealousy and that he looked on her as a fellow enthusiast I shall bother you Mr Lavender pretty often I expect I want to know everything that can be known That s the cry But isn t it a rum thing Miss Carfax how nine people out of ten knock along as though there were nothing fit to make them jump out of their skins with curiosity Why I was always like a terrier after a rat What s this What s that That s my leitmotiv But most people don t ask Nature any questions No wonder she despises them the dullards just as though they hadn t an eye to see that she s a good looking woman He erected her easel for her in the rosery tilted his Panama hat and marched off Eve sought out Guinevere and sat herself down before the prospective saint only to find that she was in no mood for painting Her glance flitted from rose to rose and the music of their names ran like a poem through her head Moreover the June air was full of their perfume a heavy somnolent perfume that lures one into dreaming Suddenly she found that he was standing in one of the black arches cut in the yew hedge She knew that the blood went to her face and she remembered telling herself that she would have to overcome these too obvious reactions He came and stood beside her looking down at her with steady and eloquent eyes You have found out Guinevere Yes We are old friends now I am not going to market this rose She is to be held sacred to Fernhill How are you getting on at the cottage Her eyes glimmered to his Thank you for everything And Billy pleases you He has a sense of humour And Mrs Baxter Has what they call a motherly way with her His eyes wandered round the rosery with a grave musing look I want to talk Talk to me here I want to know how How she accepted it Yes She laughed Thought it ridiculous And I had been ready for a possible tragedy What an amusing world it is He moved a little restlessly I want to get away from that Let s walk through the plantations I can t keep still to day I want to see you everywhere to realise you everywhere They wandered off together walking a little apart All about them rose the young trees cedars cypresses junipers yews pines glimmering in the June sunlight and sending out faint balsamic perfumes Men were hoeing the alleys between the maples and limes their hoes flashing when a beam of sunlight struck through the foliage of the young trees Canterton stopped and spoke to the men Also he spoke to Eve as to a partner and a fellow expert who understood Do you think we make enough use of maples in England Isn t there a doubt about some of them colouring well over here They give us a very fair show The spring tints are almost as good as the autumn ones in some cases I want to see what you think of a new philadelphus I have over here They walked on and when their eyes met again hers smiled into his Thank you for that seriousness It was genuine enough I am going to expect a very great deal from you I m glad I ll rise to it It will make me very happy Do you know I have learnt nearly all the names of the plants in my rock garden Have you already Yes And I am going to study every whim and trick and habit I am going to be thorough They came to a grove of black American spruces that were getting beyond the marketable age having grown to a height of fifteen or twenty feet The narrow path was in the shade a little secret path that cut through the black glooms like a river through a mountainous land Canterton was walking behind her Hold out your hand Without turning her head she held her hand out palm upwards and felt something small dropped into it Wear it under your dress It was a little gold ring the token of their spiritual marriage They came out into the sunshine and Eve s eyes were mistily bright She had not spoken but her lips were quivering sensitively She had slipped the ring on to her finger A king s ransom for your thoughts She turned to him with an indescribable smile I am Lynette s fairy mother Oh how good For her And for me I have a formal invitation to deliver from Lynette She hailed me out of the window We are to have tea in the Wilderness and Billy is asked The Wilderness That is where we forget to be clever They came round to the heath garden where it overhung the green spires of the larches I am going on with my book Your name will be added to it May I sign the plates Oh we ll have you on the title page Paintings by Eve Carfax And I shall ask you to go pilgrimaging again as you went to Latimer She drew in her breath sharply Ah Latimer I shall be dreaming dreams But I want some of them to be real Tell me them I want to help other women help them over the rough places You can do it I mean you to have a name and a career I don t want to live only for self First make self a strong castle then think of helping the distressed We are only just at the beginning of things you and I We ll have a rest home for tired workers I know of a fine site in my pine woods And you will become a woman of affairs I shall never rush about and make speeches No I don t think you will do that They turned towards the white gate and heard the voice of Lynette Lynette who had been giving chase Daddy Miss Eve She came on them running glowing hair tossing in the sunlight red mouth a little breathless Oh Miss Eve the fairies have asked you to tea I know I have heard She caught Lynette and kneeling drew her into her arms with a great spasm of tenderness I am going to be a fairy one of your fairies for ever and ever Be the Queen
