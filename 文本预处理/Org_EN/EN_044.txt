Ralph stared at the woman then threw himself back in his chair with a short laugh He was greatly disappointed in the reply It is ridiculous to believe or even hint that Madame Coralie should be guilty he remarked sharply She proved a very clear alibi No less than four people her husband and her three assistants proved that she was in the still room when the crime was taking place below Yes assented Miss Toat leaning her chin on her hand and her elbow on the table that is what puzzles me The alibi is very clear and yet of course you understand that I am merely theorising Yes Yes Yes Shawe made an irritable gesture for the strain on his nerves was great but the idea is ridiculous If you had accused that dumb girl who was in the shop on the ground floor when the crime was committed it would have been more feasible The bedroom is on the ground floor also I see no reason to accuse Peri Banou said Miss Toat quietly And you see a reason to accuse Madame Coralie Yes My theory is Oh never mind your theory Miss Toat Come to facts The detective was not at all put out by his short temper as she saw that his nerves were worn thin and sympathised with him With a quick movement she drew the loose notes to her own side of the table Very good she said in a brisk businesslike tone Let us come to facts if you please Do you know why Madame Coralie wears a yashmak Inspector Lanton hinted something about it to me when at the inquest It is to add to the attractions of the Turkish shop to make it more mysterious as it were Ah Miss Toat raised her pencilled eyebrows then the inspector did not tell you the exact truth I expect Madame Coralie asked him to keep it quiet for obvious reasons Obvious they may be said Ralph impatiently but I can t see them Why they are plain enough The wearing of the yashmak is partly by way of a good advertisement as it suggests mystery and partly this is the real reason I expect it is worn from necessity From necessity Shawe stared hard at his visitor Madame Coralie has a disfiguring birthmark on her right cheek which extending over mouth and chin spoils her good looks And she must have had some beauty when younger Strange is it not Mr Shawe that she who can restore another woman s looks can do nothing with her own How do you know that she is marked in this way I saw it when she was asleep But how did you enter her bedroom asked Ralph much astonished The detective laughed When everyone was asleep I stole about the house investigating in list slippers and with a bull s eye lantern Madame Coralie lays aside her yashmak when in bed so I easily saw that which she wishes to keep concealed But why should she so very much want to conceal it Miss Toat looked at him greatly amazed Have you not been listening to what I have been saying Mr Shawe Why if Madame s customers knew that she could not remove a birthmark from her face it would be a case of Physician heal thyself with them They would lose confidence and Yes yes Ralph assented impatiently and waved his hand I understand now very naturally they would doubt her capability in spite of her reputation But what has this birthmark to do with the murder Nothing said Perry Toat promptly yet I was glad enough to see it for all that in connection with a case But never mind she broke off abruptly we can talk of that later I tell you about the disfigurement because it is just as well that you should learn everything about a woman so closely connected with the death of Lady Branwin Also it will be a useful mark to know in case she tries to get rid of more diamonds What Shawe jumped up with an exclamation Do you mean to say that she has pawned the diamonds In that case she must be guilty It would look like it but I am only theorising remember Oh hang your theories I think He stopped short conscious that he had been rude to the little woman I beg your pardon he went on ceremoniously but my nerves are out of order Don t be vexed with me I apologise Miss Toat nodded in a friendly way I quite understand she said smoothly People unaccustomed to be mixed up with criminal matters usually do let their nerves get out of order although I can t say that they usually apologise There you have the advantage of the greater part of my clients But to come to business It is now some six or seven weeks since the murder I discovered by various inquiries which I made here there and everywhere that two months ago Madame Coralie was in deep water financially Now she is more prosperous Miss Toat paused You can draw your own inference You mean to say that she committed the murder in order to steal the diamonds and has sold or pawned them to realise the spoil Miss Toat nodded again That is my theory The barrister put his hands into his pockets and began to pace the room as was his custom when perplexed I don t see what evidence you have to support your theory he remarked after a pause Well as we agreed at our first interview Lady Branwin only arranged in five minutes to sleep at the Pink Shop and it was merely by chance that she had the diamonds with her That the murder was committed for the sake of the jewels is positive since they are missing Yet any outside person could not have known that the unfortunate woman was possessed of those jewels at that particular time Madame Coralie knew Pardon me interrupted Shawe In my own hearing she declared that she did not know what Lady Branwin had in the red bag Miss Toat shrugged her shoulders Naturally for her own sake she would say that Mr Shawe But the fact remains that owing to the rapidity and unexpectedness of Lady Branwin s decision to sleep at the shop no outsider could have arranged beforehand to commit the crime for the sake of the jewels But the key in the outside door of the court was That might all have been arranged as a false clue to throw the police off the scent I doubt it said Shawe decisively and remember that your theory is entirely destroyed by the very strong alibi of Madame Coralie The woman could not have been in two places at once Well said Perry Toat cautiously I stated that I suspected Madame Coralie had strangled Lady Branwin but I did not say that she had actually committed the deed herself Oh Then you think she employed someone else to commit the murder Yes and for her own sake was careful to provide the alibi we know of Lady Branwin came at five o clock to the shop and was murdered according to the medical evidence about eight Madame Coralie had therefore ample time to tell her accomplice that Lady Branwin possessed the diamonds Also as Lady Branwin talked frequently of coming for treatment and Madame always refused her the evening when she agreed to give the treatment might have been arranged Madame could also explain to her accomplice about the door in the outer wall of the court and have arranged for the window of the bedroom to be open Then well the rest is easy But the woman declared that the window was shut Of course for her own sake in the same way that she declared her ignorance of the diamonds being in the red bag I said lately went on Miss Toat in an apologetic manner that the key in the outer door of the court might have been arranged as a false clue I am right in one way as the key was I fancy left in the door to avert suspicion from Madame Coralie But her accomplice must have entered and escaped in that way and afterwards when Lady Branwin was dead and buried and the inquest was over she must have met her accomplice to share the spoil Hence she is now in possession of money which according to many people she sadly needed Have you traced the diamonds asked Ralph abruptly No and it will not be an easy task to trace them especially if they have been unset and sold as separate stones But I am shortly going round the pawnshops and to various fences you know what a fence is a person who receives stolen goods I suppose Mr Shawe and if Madame sold them or pawned them herself the mark may help to identify her I think not said Shawe grimly as she would probably wear a veil Certainly not a yashmak said Miss Toat quietly However I can but make inquiries as I say Moreover I shall go back to the shop again and ask further questions But I think so far as I can judge that my theory is a correct one Ralph again walked the floor Who do you think is the accomplice I can t say said the detective promptly At first I thought that Madame s husband might be the one but he was with her and the three assistants in the still room and can prove as strong an alibi as his wife What sort of person is this husband and what is his name Edward Vail is his name and he is what you would call a wastrel replied Perry Toat quickly one of those dandified idiots who walk the streets and dress loudly in order to attract the eyes of women He is good looking in an effeminate way and has never done a stroke of work in his life Strange that so clever a woman as Madame Coralie should marry such a character It is the clever women who generally make fools of themselves in this particular way said Miss Toat enigmatically However I don t think Eddy Vail he is usually called Eddy which to my mind stamps his character I don t think he is the accomplice owing to the alibi unless The little woman paused suggestively Unless what Unless the three assistants have been bribed or threatened into providing the alibi For her own sake of course Madame would say she was in the still room but Zobeide Badoura and Parizade may have been bullied or cajoled into supporting a false statement It is possible said Shawe musingly and if Madame or her husband is guilty it is easy to see how they could have learnt beforehand about the diamonds How can you get at the truth By working on Badoura s jealousy She is in love with Eddy and as she is a pretty girl the unscrupulous scamp has encouraged her in spite of the fact that he is a married man I intend to go back to the shop and to get her to state what she knows If she knows anything Quite so but if she does her jealousy of Eddy Vail will make her speak I don t know exactly how to unloosen her tongue but I shall try to But it seems ridiculous that Eddy Vail should be in love with a dumb or blind girl I didn t say that he was in love with her said Miss Toat drily but that she was in love with him which is quite a different way of looking at the matter Moreover Badoura as the forewoman is in possession of all her senses Mr Shawe Zobeide is deaf Parizade is blind and Peri Banou is dumb Badoura is all right and is simply a pretty commonplace girl who has been attracted by Eddy Vail s good looks Well said the barrister after a long pause I hope you will be successful although I am bound to say that you have no evidence that I can see to support your wild theories They may not be so very wild after all Wait until I can make Badoura speak Yes added Miss Toat with an after thought and Peri Banou also The dumb girl who was in the shop when the crime was committed Humph I suppose she may know something She may I am going to ask her Meanwhile I must have more money say another twenty pounds Ralph looked rueful I can get it for you to morrow he said doubtfully for to tell you the truth Miss Toat I am not very well off just now Can t you do without it No Mr Shawe she replied plainly I would if I could But it is necessary that I should go back to the Pink Shop and spend money as that is the only way in which I can come into contact with Badoura and Peri Banou in order to question them Of course if you wish me to give up the case No no certainly not he exclaimed hastily I shall send you the twenty pounds to your office to morrow before twelve o clock The solution of this mystery means a lot to me and I am willing to spend my last farthing on it I don t think you will have to do that said Miss Toat getting ready to go I expect to get some tangible clue from those two girls and with this piece of comfort she departed leaving Ralph rather disconsolate While the case was being examined into Shawe had seen very little of Audrey Sir Joseph had returned unexpectedly from Brighton for he had grown weary of the seaside and wished to get back to business Mrs Mellop still remained at the house on Camden Hill as the millionaire finding her an amusing woman to have at his dinner table asked her to chaperon his daughter for a longer period The widow augured from this that Branwin was really in love with her and did all she could to fascinate him still further She was glad that he had come back to be under her spell But Ralph was far from pleased by this unexpected return as he could not visit the house so freely as formerly Twice or thrice he did call but Sir Joseph was so grim and glacial in his welcome that the young man thought it was best to remain away Also Mrs Mellop taking her cue from the millionaire behaved disagreeably and kept a closer watch on Audrey Ralph was very unhappy and could only see his sweetheart at odd times and in odd ways The course of true love was not running smoothly by any means Shawe however busied himself with searching into the case with the assistance of Perry Toat That wily person came to him again and again and related various details which she had learnt from Badoura Parizade and Peri Banou which more or less helped on the matter But so busy was the barrister in fixing the pieces of the puzzle together for by this time he had learnt some tangible scraps of evidence from Perry Toat s investigations that he quite neglected Audrey He was not therefore surprised to receive a note from her asking him to come to the Round Pond in Kensington Gardens the next morning at seven o clock At that hour neither Sir Joseph nor Mrs Mellop was likely to be up and Audrey would be free from their watchful eyes Ralph promptly decided to go but sent no answer to the note since it might fall into the hands of his enemies for so he regarded the millionaire and the widow who wished to marry the millionaire Early as he was at the rendezvous Audrey was still earlier and came towards him hurriedly a pathetic figure in her black dress She kissed him hastily then at once announced the reason why she had sent for him I have received an anonymous letter said Audrey unexpectedly An anonymous letter repeated Ralph curiously What about You can read it for yourself She produced it from her pocket It advises me to refrain from investigating the murder of my mother If I do it declares that I shall suffer the greatest grief of my life Shawe was evidently startled Show
