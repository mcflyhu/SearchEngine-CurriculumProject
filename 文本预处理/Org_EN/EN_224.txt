They were sorry they had let him come A new night nurse was sent Two doctors now And either I dreamed it or at the worse times Eric was there as well But always when I was myself and the haunted night had given way to day his face was gone Yet his care was all about me The doctors were friends of his the nurses of his choosing I cannot explain why but ferreting out these facts gave me something less than the comfort they might be thought to bring Why was he troubling about me Why was he not spending every thought and every hour in trying to find Bettina Ranny had meant it well telling me I had something to live for besides Betty and giving that something a name But it was an ill turn a sword in my side for many a day and night It gave me a ceaseless smart of anger against Eric I was jealous too that it had been Ranny and not Eric who had been taking all these journeys [Pg ] Ranny had been working day and night Ranny was the person we owed most to Betty and I And was I to lie there suffocated by all this care and leave a boy like Ranny a boy I had expected so little of to spend himself soul and substance for my sister How dared Eric think that he and I were going to be happy while Ranny searched the capitals of Europe and while Bettina One night or early morning rather stands out clear Vaguely I remembered a renewed struggle and a fresh defeat Now strangely unaccountably I had waked out of deep sleep with a feeling quite safe and sure at last that Betty was free The night light had burned out A pearly greyness filled the room The nurse was sitting by the window wrapped in a shawl Her head leaning against the window frame was thrown back as though to look at something I don t know whether it was the shawl drawn[Pg ] about drooped shoulders or the association of a lifted face by the window but I thought of the hop picker And of the promise I had made Yes and kept As long as I had been at Duncombe after that haggard woman passed no other with my knowing had gone hungry away Not all suffering then was utterly vain What was the white capped figure looking at so steadily so long I raised myself on my elbow and leaned forward till I too could see A tracery of branches bare against a clear coloured sky and through the crossing lines a little white moon looked through its sky lattice into the open window of my room I got up so weak I had to cling hold of table and chair till I stood by the nurse She was asleep poor soul But I hardly noticed her then I was looking up in a kind of ecstasy for it seemed to me that a pale young face not like the Bettina I had known and still Bettina s face was leaning down out of Heaven to bring me comfort But as I looked I saw there was high purpose as well as a world of pity in the face as though[Pg ] she would have me know that not in vain her innocence had borne the burden of sin And I was full of wondering Till suddenly I realised that not to comfort me alone nor mainly was Betty leaning out of heaven she was come to do for others what no one had done for her Then the agony of the sacrifice swept over me afresh I remembered I had gone back into that last Darkness saying as I had said ten thousand times before Why had this come to Betty And now again I asked Why had it to be you Through the gentle grey of morning Betty seemed to be leading me into the Light For the answer to my question was that the suffering of evil doers had never been fruitful as the suffering of the innocent had been Was there then some life principle in such pain A voice said You shall find in mortal ill the seed of Immortal Good I knelt down by the window and thanked my sister Others shall thank her too suffocated suffocate Many dogs have suffocated in hot cars I nearly suffocated when the pipe of my breathing apparatus came adrift vaguely adv He had talked vaguely of going to work abroad He looked vaguely before him with unseeing eyes drooped droop Her eyelids drooped as if she were on the verge of sleep The flowers drooped in the heat of the sun utterly adv Utterly devoted to the people he gave his life in saving his patients I was utterly ravished by the way she smiled steadily adv The scope of man s use of natural resources will steadily grow Our educational reform was steadily led onto the correct path ecstasy n He listened to the music with ecstasy Speechless with ecstasy the little boys gazed at the toys innocence n There was a touching air of innocence about the boy The accused man proved his innocence of the crime immortal adj The wild cocoa tree is effectively immortal The heroes of the people are immortal
