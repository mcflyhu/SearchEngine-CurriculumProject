Can you hear me little Miss Harris The voice came from the dusky shed high up against the wall But the child did not turn her head Yes Mr Achilles I can hear you very well she said softly Don t look this way said the voice Get down and look at the chickens and listen to what I tell you The child dropped obediently to her knees her head a little bent her face toward the open light outside The woman going about her work in the kitchen looked out and saw her and nodded to her kindly The child s lips made a little smile in return They were very pale I come to take you home said the voice It was full of tenderness and Betty Harris bent her head a great wave of homesickness sweeping across her I can t go Mr Achilles It was like a sob I can t go They will kill you I heard them They will kill anybody that comes She spoke in swift little whispers and waited Can you hear me say it she asked Can you hear me say it Mr Achilles I hear it yes The voice of Achilles laughed a little They will not kill little lady and you go home with me to night The voice dropped down from its high place and comforted her She reached out little hands to the chickens and laughed tremulously I am afraid she said softly I am afraid But the low voice up in the dusk steadied her and gave her swift commands and repeated them till she crept from the dim shed into the light and stood up blinking a little and looked about her and laughed happily And the woman came to the door and smiled at her You must come in she called Yes Mrs Seabury The child darted back into the shed and gathered up the spoon and basin from the board and looked about her swiftly In the slatted box the mother hen clucked drowsily and wise cheeps from beneath her wings answered bravely The child glanced at the box and up at the dusky boards of the shed peering far in the dimness But there was no one not even a voice just the high tumbled pile of boards and the few nests along the wall and the mother hen clucking cosily behind her slats and the wise little cheeps bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them sweeping adj The citizens voted for sweeping reforms Can you hear the wind sweeping through the branches sob n The child started to sob when he couldn t find his mother The girl didn t answer but continued to sob with her head on the table spoke n v speak They sourced the spoke nuts from our company The spokes of a wheel are the bars that connect the outer ring to the centre darted v dart The lizard darted out its tongue at the insect The old man was displeased and darted an angry look at me drowsily adv She turned drowsily on her side a slow creeping blackness enveloping her mind I felt asleep drowsily before I knew it cosily adv Its snow white houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation
