Audrey handed over a dingy envelope bearing the London postmark and addressed to her at the Camden Hill house Out of this Shawe took an equally dingy piece of paper a single sheet of very cheap stationery On it a few lines in vile caligraphy were scrawled He read them at once while Audrey sat down on a near chair and watched him silently Dear Miss ran the anonymous letter This is to warn you from invistigiting your poor ma s deth as I know you are doing Keip off the gras and don t be silly or you will sueffer the gratest grief of your life This is from one who sines as you see A Frend What do you think of it asked the girl when her lover silently replaced the paper in its envelope and sat down beside her I think there may be something in it said Shawe slowly I wonder You wonder what If it would not be as well to take the advice of this and he tapped the envelope as he handed it back to her No cried Audrey her worn face flushing A thousand times no I shall learn the truth at all costs But if it leads to more sorrow dear I don t care what it leads to To know the worst whatever the worst may be is better than this terrible suspense She looked at the dingy communication dubiously I wonder who wrote this An uneducated person apparently I don t believe it declared the girl quickly All that bad spelling and bad writing is intended to mislead Shawe shook his head How can you be sure of that I am sure of nothing I am only assuming that such is the case But at all events the person who wrote this letter knows that the matter of the death is being looked into I don t see who can possibly know save you and myself and Perry Toat Who is Perry Toat The detective whom I am employing to search What has he found out She dear Miss Toat s name is Peronella Toat and she calls herself Perry on her card for business reasons She has found out nothing very tangible and confines herself to theorising a lot Ralph paused and shook his head once more I fancy she is growing tired of the case And he related Perry Toat s discoveries such as they were and also detailed her theories When he ended Audrey was almost as despairing as he appeared to be There doesn t seem to be a single ray of light lamented the girl putting the envelope into her pocket Madame Coralie her assistants and her husband seem to be all innocent unless she added with a quick look there is something in this idea of a prepared alibi Well Miss Toat has learnt nothing likely to show that her surmise is right in that way Audrey Badoura apparently knows nothing or infatuated with Eddy Vail refuses to say what she may know As to Peri Banou who is dumb no information can be got from her although she was in the shop when the crime was committed She says that she was asleep on a divan and Zobeide certainly admits that she left her there when she went up to the still room Badoura Peri Banou Zobeide said Miss Branwin ticking off the quaint and musical names on her fingers You have mentioned only three of the assistants What about the fourth Parizade Oh being blind of course she can see nothing at all She was behind the curtain in the still room preparing some wash when Madame Coralie came to speak to her husband That was about eight o clock just before Madame came down to tell you that your mother would remain for the night It was about half past eight that Madame came to the door Oh my dear girl you must be mistaken Madame herself and her husband both say it was five or ten minutes after eight o clock when she came to you Audrey shook her head vehemently Mrs Mellop will tell you that we did not leave the house until a quarter past eight The Pink Shop That of course would make it right No our own house There was a first piece at the theatre which Mrs Mellop and I did not care about seeing We only left in time to get to the theatre by nine when the chief drama of the evening began It was nearly half past eight when we reached the Pink Shop as it took us ten minutes more or less to get to Walpole Lane There must be some mistake said Shawe rather puzzled by this clear and positive explanation Why Badoura says that Eddy Vail drew her attention to the clock in the still room and then it was five minutes to eight Almost immediately afterwards Madame came up from seeing your mother tucked in for the night and very shortly went to the shop door to speak to you Then the clock in the still room must be wrong said Audrey Tell Miss Toat what I say and she may be able to learn if it is so Well and supposing you prove that the still room clock is wrong Can t you see In that case Madame Coralie could not have come up from seeing my mother safely to bed for she must have come up to the still room at about fifteen or twenty minutes past the hour And the medical evidence says that my poor mother was murdered at eight o clock It does seem strange said Shawe reflectively Humph I wonder if Perry Toat is right after all and if this alibi a very convincing one I must say is a faked affair Audrey he turned earnestly towards the girl say nothing of this to anyone Will you tell Miss Toat Yes I shall certainly do that But after all both you and the still room clock may be right It only means that Madame waited twenty minutes or so talking to her husband instead of coming down at once But if she came at once Then the matter will have to be looked into I shall ask Miss Toat to question Badoura and Eddy Vail who noticed the time They may be able to say how long Madame Coralie remained in the still room But my dear it is all a mere theory And one that may prove to be true Really Ralph Audrey spoke with a flush on her face you don t seem anxious to learn the truth I am in one way and not in another I remember that anonymous letter I don t care what the letter says The person who wrote it is evidently concerned in the death of my poor mother and is afraid lest he or she should be caught There may be some truth in that admitted Shawe However you had better leave the matter in my hands I shall tell Perry Toat what you say about the difference in time always supposing that Madame Coralie did not linger in the still room When I hear of anything definite likely to supply a clue I shall let you know You have let me know very little hitherto said Audrey bitterly My darling he took her hands and looked into her eyes surely you are not dissatisfied with me I am in a way she admitted blushing guiltily I am so anxious to learn the truth and revenge my mother If you won t search I shall search myself Shawe could do nothing in the face of this determination but agree He scribbled Perry Toat s address on his card and gave it to the girl Audrey slipped it into the dingy envelope which held the anonymous letter with the intention of calling on the detective whenever she could If you go on with the matter I shall help you to the best of my ability he said earnestly as she turned away Don t think that I do not desire your wish to be gratified I only want you to be happy I won t be happy until I learn who murdered my dear mother said the girl obstinately then she took his arm and they walked across to the gate near the Palace But I am glad that you will help me All I ask is that you will let me assist you You shall go to Perry Tat yourself and take an immediate hand in the game we are playing said the barrister decidedly as I see that in no other way will you be satisfied And now let me see you home Don t come too far with me dear My father may have risen by this time and if he meets you there will be trouble I don t mind that said Shawe throwing back his well shaped head I am not afraid of Sir Joseph By the way talking about the possibility of that clock being wrong was your father with you in the car No He went out at six o clock for one of his prowls What do you mean by one of his prowls asked Shawe surprised Well papa for all our talking is really kind when he chooses He is sorry for poor people for the really ragged unwashed poor that is and sometimes he goes out quietly and wanders round the streets giving money to beggars and helping those who need help You throw quite a light on your father s character said Ralph grimly I should have thought that Sir Joseph was the last person in the world to help anyone or to act the secret philanthropist Mrs Mellop told me that he did so She saw him once or twice in a tweed suit in the evening helping people giving money that is And papa must go out for some such purpose for he usually puts on evening dress for dinner And changes it afterwards No on the nights he goes out he doesn t change his clothes and very often doesn t come to dinner On that night Mrs Mellop and I had the meal to ourselves and went alone to the theatre Papa had gone out at six in his usual clothes for a prowl Perhaps ended Audrey wistfully I have misjudged my father and he may not be so hard as I think I never knew that he helped the poor until Mrs Mellop told me and she only saw him by chance when her taxi cab broke down one evening on the Embankment Well I am glad to hear that Sir Joseph has some redeeming qualities said Shawe somewhat cynically for the whole story sounded improbable seeing what he knew of the man Neither of the young people noticed at the time that they were near the gates of Branwin s mansion and were therefore astonished when Sir Joseph himself stepped out He was dressed in a rough tweed suit and looked more bulky and aggressive than ever With a scowl he fairly snatched his daughter from the barrister s arm I expected something of this sort Audrey when you went out so early he said in his domineering tones I was just coming to Kensington Gardens Mrs Mellop kindly told me how you met this rascal in I am no rascal sir said Shawe spiritedly Yes you are You know that I don t wish my daughter to marry you and yet you arrange secret meetings in the Gardens I am to blame if anyone said Audrey hotly for I arranged the meeting A pretty confession for a young lady said her father grimly but I shall take care that you arrange no more As for you sir he turned on Ralph I forbid you to think of Miss Branwin She is to marry Lord Anvers I shall not cried Audrey growing white but perfectly determined You shall I have spoken to Lord Anvers and he is willing to make you his wife You understand Mr Shawe I understand that I intend to marry Audrey said the barrister coolly so it matters little what arrangements you have made with Anvers who is indeed the rascal you called me Go inside Audrey said Branwin and pushed his daughter
