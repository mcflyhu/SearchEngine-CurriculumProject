When Dominick returned to consciousness he lay for a space looking directly in front of him then moved his head and let his eyes sweep the walls They were alien walls of white plaster naked of all adornment The light from a shaded lamp lay across one of them in a soft yet clear wash of yellow so clear that he could see that the plaster was coarse There were few pieces of furniture in the room and all new to him A bureau of the old fashioned marble topped kind stood against the wall opposite The lamp that cast the yellow light was on this bureau its globe a translucent gold reflection revealed in liquid clearness in the mirror just behind It was not his own room nor Berny s He turned his head farther on the pillow very slowly for he seemed sunk in an abyss of suffering and feebleness On the table by the bed s head was another lamp a folded newspaper shutting its light from his face and here his eyes stopped A woman was sitting by the foot of the bed her head bent as if reading He stared at her with even more intentness than he had at the room The glow of the lamp on the bureau was behind her he saw her against it without color or detail like a shadow thrown on a sheet Her outlines were sharply defined against the illumined stretch of plaster the arch of her head which was broken by the coils of hair on top her rather short neck with some sort of collar binding it the curve of her shoulders rounded and broad not the shoulders of a thin woman He did not think she was his wife but she might be and he moved and said suddenly in a husky voice What time is it The woman started laid her book down and rose She came forward and stood beside him looking down the filaments of hair round her head blurring the sharpness of its outline He stared up at her haggard and intent and saw it was not his wife It was a strange woman with a pleasant smiling face He felt immensely relieved and said with a hoarse carefulness of utterance What time did you say it is A few minutes past five she answered You ve been asleep Have I he said gazing immovably at her What day is it Thursday she replied You came here last night from Rocky Bar Perhaps you don t remember Rocky Bar he repeated vaguely groping through a haze of memory Was it only yesterday Was it only yesterday I left San Francisco I don t know when you left San Francisco the newspaper shade cracked and bent a little letting a band of light fall across the pillow She leaned down arranging it with careful hands looking from the light to him to see if it were correctly adjusted Whenever you left San Francisco she said you got here last night They brought you here Perley and some other men in the sleigh They found you in the road You were half frozen He looked at her moving hands then when they had satisfactorily arranged the shade and dropped to her sides he looked at her face Her eyes were soft and friendly and had a gentle kind expression He liked to look at them The only woman s eyes he had looked into lately had been full of wrathful lightenings There seemed no need to be polite or do the things that people did when they were well and sitting talking in chairs so he did not speak for what seemed to him a long time Then he said What is this place Antelope said the woman Perley s Hotel at Antelope Oh yes he answered with an air of weary recollection I was going to walk there from Rocky Bar but the snow came down too hard and the wind you could hardly stand against it It was a terrible pull Perley s Hotel at Antelope Of course I know all about it I was here last summer for two weeks fishing She stretched out her hand for a glass across the top of which a book rested He followed the movement with a mute fixity This is your medicine she said taking the book off the glass You were to take it at five but I didn t like to wake you She dipped a spoon into the glass and held it out to him But the young man felt too ill to bother with medicine and as the spoon touched his lips he gave his head a slight jerk and the liquid was spilt on the counterpane She looked at it for a rueful moment then said as if with gathering determination But you must take it I think perhaps I gave it wrong I ought to have lifted you up It s easier that way and before he could answer she slipped her arm under his head and raised it with the other hand setting the rim of the glass against his lips He swallowed a mouthful and felt her arm sliding from behind his head He had a hazy consciousness that a perfume came from her dress and for the first time he wondered who she was Wondering thus his eyes again followed her hand putting back the glass and watched it white in the gush of lamplight carefully replacing the book Then she turned toward him with the same slight soft smile Who are you he said keeping his hollowed eyes hard on her I m Rose Cannon she answered Rose Cannon from San Francisco Oh yes with a movement of comprehension the name striking a chord of memory Rose Cannon from San Francisco daughter of Bill Cannon Of course I know He was silent again overwhelmed by indifference and lassitude She made a step backward from the bedside Her dress rustled and the same faint perfume he had noticed came delicately to him He turned his head away from her and said dryly and without interest I thought it was some one else The words seemed to arrest her She came back and stood close beside him Looking up he could see her head against the light that ran up from the shaded lamps along the ceiling She bent down and said speaking slowly and clearly as though to a child The storm has broken the wires but as soon as they are up papa will send your mother word so you needn t worry about that But we don t either of us know your wife s address If you could tell us She stopped He had begun to frown and then shut his eyes with an expression of weariness That doesn t matter he said Don t bother about it Let her alone Again there was one of those pauses which seemed to him so long He gave a sigh and moved restlessly and she said Are your feet very painful Yes pretty bad he answered What s the matter with them They were frost bitten one partly frozen Oh he did not seem profoundly interested It was as if they were some one else s feet only they hurt violently enough to obtrude themselves upon his attention Thank you very much he added I ll be all right to morrow He felt very tired and heard as in a dream the rustle of her dress as she moved again She said something about supper and Mrs Perley coming and the dark enveloping sense of stupor from which he had come to life closed on him again Some time later on he emerged from it and saw another woman stout and matronly with sleekly parted hair and an apron girt about her He asked her too who she was for the fear that he might wake and find his wife by his bedside mingled with the pain of his feet to torment him and break the vast dead restfulness of the torpor in which he lay It broke into gleams of interest and returning consciousness during the next two days He experienced an acuter sense of illness and pain the burning anguish of his feet and fevered misery of his body bitten through with cold brought him back to a realization of his own identity He heard the doctor murmuring in the corner of threatened pneumonia and understood that he was the object threatened He began to know and separate the strange faces that seemed continually to be bending over him asking him how he felt There was the doctor Perley Bill Cannon and the old judge and three different women whom he had some difficulty in keeping from merging into one composite being who was sometimes Miss Cannon and sometimes Mrs Perley and then again Cora When on the fourth day the doctor told him that he thought he would pull through with no worse ailment than a frozen foot he had regained enough of his original vigor and impatience under restraint to express a determination to rise and go on He was in pain mental and physical and the ministrations and attentions of the satellites that so persistently revolved round his bed rasped him into irritable moodiness He did not know that all Antelope was waiting for the latest bulletins from Mrs Perley or Cora The glamour attaching to his sensational entry into their midst had been intensified by the stories of the wealth and position that had been his till he had married a poor girl contrary to his mother s wishes He was talked of in the bar discussed in the kitchen and Cora dreamed of him at night The very name of Ryan carried its weight and Antelope a broken congeries of white roofs and black smoke stacks emerging from giant drifts throbbed with pride at the thought that the two greatest names of California finance were snow bound in Perley s Hotel The doctor laughed at his desire to move on The storm was still raging and Antelope was as completely cut off from the rest of the world as if it were an uncharted island in the unknown reaches of the Pacific Propping the invalid up among his pillows he drew back the curtain and let him look out through a frost painted pane on a world all sweeping lines and skurrying eddies of white The drifts curled crisp edges over the angles of roofs like the lips of breaking waves The glimpse of the little town that the window afforded showed it cowering under a snow blanket almost lost to sight in its folds Even if your feet were all right you re tied here for two weeks anyway said the doctor dropping the curtain It s the biggest storm I ever saw and there s an old timer that hangs round the bar who says it s as bad as the one that caught the Donner party in forty six The next day it stopped and the world lay gleaming and still under a frosty crust The sky was a cold sullen gray brooding and cloud hung and the roofs and tree tops stood out against it as though executed in thick white enamel The drifts lay in suave curves softly undulating like the outlines of a woman s body sometimes sweeping smoothly up to second stories here and there curdled into an eddy frozen as it twisted A miner came in from an outlying camp on skees and reported the cold as intense the air clear as crystal and perfectly still On the path as he came numerous fir boughs had broken under the weight of snow with reports like pistol shots There was a rumor that men short of provisions were snowed up at the Yaller Dog mine just beyond the shoulder of the mountain This gave rise to much consultation and loud talking in the bar and the lower floor of Perley s was as full of people noise and stir as though a party were in progress That afternoon Dominick clothed in an old bath robe of the doctor s his swathed feet hidden under a red rug drawn from Mrs Perley s stores was promoted to an easy chair by the window The doctor who had helped him dress having disposed the rug over his knees and tucked a pillow behind his back stood off and looked critically at the effect I ve got to have you look your best he said and you ve got to act your prettiest this afternoon The young lady s coming in to take care of you while I go my rounds Young lady exclaimed Dominick in a tone that indicated anything but pleasurable anticipation What young lady Our young lady answered the doctor Miss Cannon the Young Lady of Perley s Hotel Don t you know that that s the nicest girl in the world Maybe you don t but that s because your powers of appreciation have been dormant for the last few days The people here were most scared to death of her at first They didn t know how she was going to get along used to the finest the way she s always been But bless your heart she s less trouble than anybody in the place There s twelve extra people eating here besides you to be looked after and Mrs Perley and Cora are pretty near run to death trying to do it Miss Cannon wanted to turn in and help them They wouldn t have it but they had to let her do her turn here taking care of you It s very kind of her said the invalid without enthusiasm I noticed her here several times And as easy as an old shoe said the doctor Just as nice to Perley s boy who s a waif that the Perleys picked up in the streets of Stockton as if he was the Prince of Wales I tell you heredity s a queer thing How did Bill Cannon come to have a girl like that Of course there s the mother to take into account but A knock on the door interrupted him To his cry of Come in Rose entered a white shawl over her shoulders a book in her hand While she and Dominick were exchanging greetings the doctor began thrusting his medicines into his bag alleging the necessity of an immediate departure as two cases of bronchitis and three of pneumonia awaited him You didn t know there were that many people in Antelope he said as he snapped the clasp of the bag and picked up his hat Well I ll swear to it even if it does seem the prejudiced estimate of an old inhabitant So long I ll be back by five and I hope to hear a good report from the nurse The door closed behind him and Dominick and the young girl were left looking rather blankly at each other It was the first time he had seen her when he had not been presented to her observation as a prostrate and fever stricken sufferer of whom nothing was expected but a docile attitude in the matter of medicines Now he felt the subjugating power of clothes It did not seem possible that the doctor s bath robe and Mrs Perley s red rug could cast such a blighting weight of constraint and consciousness upon him But with the donning of them his invalid irresponsibility seemed gone for ever He had a hunted helpless feeling that he ought to talk to this young woman as gentlemen did who were not burdened by the pain of frozen feet and marital troubles Moreover he felt the annoyance of being thus thrust upon the care of a lady whom he hardly knew I m very sorry that they bothered you this way he said awkwardly I I don t think I need any one with me I m quite comfortable here by myself and then he stopped conscious of the ungraciousness of his words and reddening uncomfortably I dare say you don t want me here said Rose with an air of meekness which had the effect of being assumed But you really have been too sick to be left alone Besides there s your medicine you must take that regularly The invalid gave an indifferent cast of his eye toward the glass on the bureau guarded by the familiar book and spoon Then he looked back at her She was regarding him deprecatingly Couldn t I take it myself he said I don t think I d trust you she answered His sunken glance was held by hers and he saw under the deprecation of her look humor struggling to keep itself in seemly suppression He was faintly surprised There did not seem to him anything comic in the fact of her distrust But as he looked at her he saw the humor rising past control She dropped her eyes to hide it and bit her under lip This did strike him as funny and a slow grin broke the melancholy of his face She stole a stealthy look at him her gravity vanished at the first glimpse of the grin and she[ ] began to laugh holding her head down and making the stifled chuckling sounds of controlled mirth suddenly liberated He was amused and a little puzzled and with his grin more pronounced than before said What are you laughing at She lifted her head and looked at him with eyes narrowed to slits murmuring You trying to get rid of me and being so polite and helpless It s too pathetic for words If it s pathetic why do you laugh he said laughing himself he did not know why She made no immediate reply and he looked at her languidly interested and admiring For the first time he realized that she was a pretty girl with her glistening coils of blond hair and a pearl white skin just now suffused with pink Why did you think I wanted to get rid of you he asked You ve almost said so she answered And then well I can see you do How What have I done that you ve seen Not any especial thing but I think you do He felt too weak and indifferent to tell polite falsehoods Leaning his head on the pillow that stood up at his back he said Perhaps I did at first But now I m glad you came She smiled indulgently at him as though he were a sick child I should think you wouldn t have wanted me You must be so tired of people coming in and out Those days when you were so bad the doctor had the greatest difficulty in keeping men out who didn t know you and had never seen you Everybody in the hotel wanted to crowd in What did they want to do that for To see you We were the sensation of Antelope first But then you came and put us completely in the shade Antelope hasn t had such an excitement as your appearance since the death of Jim Granger whose picture is down stairs in the parlor and who comes from here I don t see why I should be an excitement When I was up here fishing last summer nobody was in the least excited It was the way you came half dead out of the night as if the sea had thrown you up Then everybody wanted to know why you did it why you a Californian attempted such a dangerous thing There wasn t anything so desperately dangerous about it he said almost in a tone of sulky protest The men down stairs seemed to think so They say nobody could have got up here in such a storm Oh rubbish Besides it wasn t storming when I left Rocky Bar It was gray and threatening but there wasn t a flake falling The first snow came down when I was passing the Silver Crescent It came very fast after that Why did you do it attempt to walk such a distance in such uncertain weather Dominick smoothed the rug over his knees His face looking down had a curious expression of cold enforced patience I was tired he said slowly I d worked too hard and I thought the mountains would do me good I can get time off at the bank when I want and I thought I d take a holiday and come up here where I was last summer I knew the place and liked the hotel I wanted to get a good way off out of the city and away from my work As for walking up here that afternoon I m very strong and I never thought for a moment such a blizzard was coming down He lifted his head and turned toward the window then raising one hand rubbed it across his forehead and eyes There was something in the gesture that silenced the young girl She thought he felt tired and had been talking too much and she was guiltily conscious of her laughter and loquacity They sat without speaking for some moments Dominick made no attempt to break the silence when she moved noiselessly to the stove and pushed in more wood His face was turned from her and she thought he had fallen asleep when he suddenly moved and said Isn t it strange that I have never met you before She was relieved His tone showed neither feebleness nor fatigue in fact it had the fresh alertness of a return to congenial topics She determined however to be less talkative less encouraging to the weakening exertions of general conversation So she spoke with demure brevity Yes very But you were at college for four years and the year you came back I was in Europe He looked at her ruminatingly and nodded But I ve seen you he said at the theater I was too sick at first to recognize you but afterward I knew I d seen you with your father and your brother Gene It was her turn to nod She thought it best to say nothing and waited But his eyes bent inquiringly upon her and the waiting silence seemed to demand a comment She made the first one that occurred to her Whom were you with My wife said the young man Rose felt that an indefinite silence would have been better than this All she knew of Dominick Ryan s wife was that she was a person who had not been respectable and whose union with Dominick had estranged him from his people Certainly whatever else she was young Mrs Ryan was not calculated to be an agreeable subject of converse with the man who in marrying her had sacrificed wealth family and friends The doctor s chief injunction to Rose had been to keep the invalid in a state of tranquillity Oppressed by a heavy sense of failure she felt that nursing was not her forte She murmured a vague sentence of comment and this time determined not to speak no matter how embarrassing the pause became She even thought of taking up her book and was about to stretch her hand for it when he said But it seems so queer when our parents have been friends for years and I know Gene and you know my sister Cornelia so well She drew her hand back and leaned forward frowning and staring in front of her as she sent her memory backward groping for data Well you see a sort of series of events prevented it When we were little our parents lived in different places Ages ago when we first came down from Virginia City you were living somewhere else in Sacramento wasn t it Then you were at school and after that you went East to college for four years and when you got back from college I was in Europe And when I came back from Europe that s over two years ago now why then She had again brought up against his marriage this time with a shock that was of a somewhat shattering nature Why then she repeated falteringly realizing where she was why then let s see Then I had married he said quietly Oh yes of course she assented trying to impart a suggestion of sudden innocent remembrance to her tone You had married Why of course He vouchsafed no reply She was distressed and mortified her face red with anger at her own stupidity In her embarrassment she looked down smoothing her lace cuffs and waiting for him to say something as he had done before But this time he made no attempt to resume the conversation Stealing a sidelong glance at him she saw that he had turned to the window and was gazing out There was an expression of brooding gloom on his profile his eyebrows drawn low his lips close set She judged rightly that he did not intend to speak again and she took up her book and opened it Half an hour later rising to give him his medicine she saw that he had fallen asleep She was at his side before she discovered it thinking his eyes were drooped in thought Standing with the glass in her hand she looked at him with something of a child s shrinking curiosity and a woman s pity for a strong creature weakened and brought low The light in the room was growing gray and in it she saw his face with the shadows in its hollows looking thin and haggard in the abandonment of sleep For the first time seeing him clothed and upright she realized that he was a personable man a splendid man and also for the first time she thought of him outside this room and this house and a sort of proud resentment stirred in her at the memory of the marriage he had made the marriage with the woman who was not good An hour later when the doctor came back she was kneeling on the floor by the open stove door softly building up the fire From the orifice a circle of brilliance in the dim room a red glow painted her serious down bent face with a hectic color and touched with a bright palpitating glaze the curves of her figure At the sound of the opening door she looked up quickly and her hands being occupied gave a silencing jerk of her head toward the sleeping man The doctor looked at them both The scene was like a picture of some primitive domestic interior where youth and beauty had made a nest warmed by
