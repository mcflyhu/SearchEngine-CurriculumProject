Eve Carfax read James Canterton s letter at breakfast and her mother who like many passive people was vapidly inquisitive wanted to know when the letter had come why it had been written what it said and what it did not say Eve was a little flushed and ready to fall into a reverie while looking along a vista of sudden possibilities This frank and straightforward letter had brought a flutter of exultation into her life Mr Canterton wants me to do some flower pictures for him How nice dear And shall you Of course if I can It must have been our subscription to Mother is it likely I am sure Mrs Canterton was most charming Is he going to pay you for He doesn t say anything about it He might not think it quite nice to say anything just at first I really don t know why it shouldn t be nice to mention a thing that we all must have He wants me to go and see him Eve set off for Fernhill with a delightful sense of exhilaration She was in a mood to laugh especially at the incident of yesterday and at the loss of those two half crowns that had seemed so tragic and depressing This might be her first big bit of luck the beginning of a wider finer life for which she yearned She was amused at her mother s idea about Mrs Canterton Mrs Canterton indeed Why the flow of her thoughts was sharply arrested and held back by the uprising of a situation that suddenly appeared before her as something extraordinarily incongruous These two people were married This fussy sallow faced fidgeting egotist and this big meditative colour loving man What on earth were they doing living together in the same house And what on earth was she herself doing letting her thoughts wander into affairs that did not concern her She suppressed the curious feeling of distaste the subject inspired in her took a plunge into a cold bath of self restraint and came out close knit and vigorous Eve Carfax had a very fastidious pride that detested anything that could be described as vulgarly curious She wanted no one to finger her own intimate self and she recoiled instinctively from any tendency on her own part towards taking back door views of life She was essentially clean with an ideal whiteness that yet could flush humanly But the idea of contemplating the soiled petals of other people s ideals repelled her Eve entered the Fernhill Nurseries by the great oak gates that opened through a high hedge of arbor vit She found herself in a large gravelled space a kind of quadrangle surrounded by offices storerooms stables and packing sheds all built in the old English style of oak white plaster and red tiles The extraordinary neatness of the place struck her It was like a big forecourt to the mysteries beyond She had her hand on the office bell when Canterton came out having seen her through the window He was in white flannels and wearing a straw hat that deepened the colour of his eyes and skin Good morning We both appear to be punctual people He was smiling and looking at her attentively It was good of you to come up at once I left it open I think it would be a good idea if I took you over the whole place She answered his smile losing a momentary shyness I should like to see everything Do you know Mr Canterton you have set me up on the high horse and Well I don t want to fall off I have been having thrills of delightful dread I know just what a man feels before an exam when he is pretty sure of himself I don t know that I am sure of myself If you can paint other things as you painted that rose I don t think there is any need for you to worry The quiet assurance of his praise sent a shiver of exultation through her What an encouraging and comforting person he was He just intimated that he believed you could do a thing very well and the thing itself seemed half done Then I ll show you the whole place I m a bit of an egotist in my way It s only showing someone what you have created He took her everywhere beginning with what he called the administrative department She saw the great glass houses the stacks of bracken for packing the piles of ash and chestnut stakes the shed where three old men spent their time making big baskets and hampers the rows and rows of frames the packing and dispatch sheds the seed room the little laboratory with its microscopes and microtome and shelves of bottles the office where several clerks were constantly at work Canterton was apologetic I have a craze for showing everything It gives one insight I like it It won t tire you I think I am a very healthy young woman He looked at the fresh face and at the lithe though fragile figure and felt somehow that the June day had an indefinable perfume I should like to show you some of the young conifers They were wonderful trees with wonderful names quaint solemn and diminutive yet with all the dignity of forests patriarchs They grew in groves and companies showing all manner of colours dense metallic greens soft blues golds silvers greys green blacks ambers Each tree had beauties and characteristics of its own They were diminutive models of a future maturity solemn children that would be cedars cypresses junipers pines and yews They delighted Eve Oh the little people ready to grow up I never knew there were such trees and such colours He saw the same look in her eyes as he had seen in the rosery the same tenderness about the mouth I walk about here sometimes and wonder where they will all go to Yes isn t it strange Some day I want to do a book on trees Do you What s the name of that dear Japanese looking infant there Retinospora Densa You know we nurserymen and some of the botanists quarrel about names What does it matter I tried to study botany but the jargon Yes it is pretty hopeless I played a joke once on some of our botanical friends sent them a queer thing I had had sent from China and labelled it Cantertoniana Gloria in Excelsis They took it quite seriously The dears Laughter passed between them and an intimate flashing of the eyes that told how the joy of life welled up and met They wandered on through acres of glowing maples golden privets and elders purple leaved plums arbutus rhododendrons azaleas and all manner of flowering shrubs In one quiet corner an old gardener with a white beard was budding roses Elsewhere men were hoeing the alleys between the straight rows of young forest trees poplars birches elms beeches ilexes mountain ashes chestnuts and limes There were acres of fruit trees acres of roses acres of the commoner kind of evergreens great waves of glooming green rolling with a glisten of sunlight over the long slopes of the earth Eve grew more silent She was all eyes all wonder It seemed futile to exclaim when there was so much beauty everywhere They came at last to a pleasaunce that was the glory of the hour an herbaceous garden in full bloom with brick paved paths box edging and here and there an old tree stump or a rough arch smothered with clematis or honeysuckle Delphiniums in every shade of blue rose like the crowded and tapering fl ches of a medi val city There were white lilies gaudy gaillardias blazing like suns campanulas violas foxgloves snapdragons mauve erigeron monkshood English iris and scores of other plants It was gorgeous and yet full of subtle gradations of colour like some splendid Persian carpet in which strange dyes merged and mingled Bees hummed everywhere Old red brick walls half covered with various kinds of ivy formed a mellow background And away on the horizon floated the blue of the Surrey hills Eve stood motionless lips slightly apart Mr Canterton You like it Am I to paint this I hope so Let me pour out my humility He laughed gently Oh you can do it Can I And the old walls I should not have thought the place was so old It isn t I bought my bricks Some old cottages were being pulled down Thank God sometimes for money She stood a moment her chin raised her eyes throwing long level glances down the walks Mr Canterton let me do two or three trial sketches before you decide anything Just as you like Please tell me exactly what you want I want you to begin here and in the rosery You see this book of mine is going to be a big thing a treasure house for the real people who want to know I shall need portraits of individual flowers and studies of colour effects during the different months I shall also want illustrations of many fine gardens that have been put at my service That is to say I may have to ask you to travel about a little to paint some of the special things such as the Ryecroft Dutch garden and the Italian gardens at Latimer As he spoke the horizon of her life seemed to broaden before her It was like the breaking through of a winter dawn when the grey crevices of the east fill with sudden fire Everything looked bigger more wonderful more alluring I had no idea He was watching her face Well That it was to be such a big thing It may take me two or three more years I have allowed myself five years for the book She drew in her breath Mr Canterton I don t know what to say And I don t think you realise what you are offering me Just life more life But it almost frightens me that you should think His eyes smiled at her understandingly Paint me a few trial pieces Begin with one of the borders here and a rose bed in the rosery that I will show you Also give me a study of trees and another of rocks and plants in the rock garden I will begin at once He looked beyond her towards the blue hills As to the terms between us will you let me write you a letter embodying them Yes You can have an agreement if you like She answered at once No I think somehow I would rather not And please don t propose anything till you have seen more of what I can do Canterton led the way towards the rosery to show her the roses he wanted her to paint and in passing through one of the tunnels in the yew hedge they were dashed into by a child who came flying like a blown leaf It was Eve who received the rush of the impetuous figure Her hands held Lynette to save her from falling Hallo Lynette s face lifted to hers with surprise and laughter and a questioning shyness Eve kept her hold for the moment They looked at each other with an impulse towards friendliness Lynette old lady Daddy Miss Vance has gone off Pop Miss Carfax let me introduce my daughter Miss Lynette Canterton Miss Carfax Eve slid her hands from Lynette s body but the child s hands clung and held hers I m so sorry I hope it didn t hurt I don t think I ve seen you before Well we rushed at each other when we did meet Is daddy showing you the garden Yes My name s Lynette not like linnet you know but Lyn net And my name s Eve just Eve Who was made out of Adam s rib Poor Mr Adam I wonder whether he missed it They all laughed Lynette kept hold of one of Eve s hands and held out her other one to Canterton Daddy do come down to the Wilderness I want to build a wagwim Or wigwam I like wagwim better Do come Miss Canterton I am most seriously occupied She tossed her hair and turned on Eve You ll come too Miss Eve Now I ve invited you daddy will have to come Ask him Eve looked at Canterton and there was something strange in the eyes of both Mr Canterton I am requested to ask you I surrender I may as well tell you Miss Carfax that very few people are invited into the Wilderness It is fairyland I appreciate it Lynette may I come and build a wagwim with you Yes do What a nice voice you ve got Have I Eve blushed queerly and was intimately conscious of Canterton s eyes looking at her with peculiar and half wondering intentness I m going to have dinner there Mother is out and Miss Vance is going to Guildford by train And Sarah has given me two jam tarts and some cheese straws and two bananas Canterton tweaked her hair That s an idea I m on good terms with Sarah We ll have some lunch and a bottle of red wine sent down to the Wilderness and picnic in a wagwim if the wagwim wams by lunch time Come along come
