Frona waved her hand to Andy and swung out on the trail Fastened tightly to her back were her camera and a small travelling satchel In addition she carried for alpenstock the willow pole of Neepoosa Her dress was of the mountaineering sort short skirted and scant allowing the greatest play with the least material and withal gray of color and modest Her outfit on the backs of a dozen Indians and in charge of Del Bishop had got under way hours before The previous day on her return with Matt McCarthy from the Siwash camp she had found Del Bishop at the store waiting her His business was quickly transacted for the proposition he made was terse and to the point She was going into the country He was intending to go in She would need somebody If she had not picked any one yet why he was just the man He had forgotten to tell her the day he took her ashore that he had been in the country years before and knew all about it True he hated the water and it was mainly a water journey but he was not afraid of it He was afraid of nothing Further he would fight for her at the drop of the hat As for pay when they got to Dawson a good word from her to Jacob Welse and a year s outfit would be his No no no grub stake about it no strings on him He would pay for the outfit later on when his sack was dusted What did she think about it anyway And Frona did think about it for ere she had finished breakfast he was out hustling the packers together She found herself making better speed than the majority of her fellows who were heavily laden and had to rest their packs every few hundred yards Yet she found herself hard put to keep the pace of a bunch of Scandinavians ahead of her They were huge strapping blond haired giants each striding along with a hundred pounds on his back and all harnessed to a go cart which carried fully six hundred more Their faces were as laughing suns and the joy of life was in them The toil seemed child s play and slipped from them lightly They joked with one another and with the passers by in a meaningless tongue and their great chests rumbled with cavern echoing laughs Men stood aside for them and looked after them enviously for they took the rises of the trail on the run and rattled down the counter slopes and ground the iron rimmed wheels harshly over the rocks Plunging through a dark stretch of woods they came out upon the river at the ford A drowned man lay on his back on the sand bar staring upward unblinking at the sun A man in irritated tones was questioning over and over Where s his pardner Ain t he got a pardner Two more men had thrown off their packs and were coolly taking an inventory of the dead man s possessions One called aloud the various articles while the other checked them off on a piece of dirty wrapping paper Letters and receipts wet and pulpy strewed the sand A few gold coins were heaped carelessly on a white handkerchief Other men crossing back and forth in canoes and skiffs took no notice The Scandinavians glanced at the sight and their faces sobered for a moment Where s his pardner Ain t he got a pardner the irritated man demanded of them They shook their heads They did not understand English They stepped into the water and splashed onward Some one called warningly from the opposite bank whereat they stood still and conferred together Then they started on again The two men taking the inventory turned to watch The current rose nigh to their hips but it was swift and they staggered while now and again the cart slipped sideways with the stream The worst was over and Frona found herself holding her breath The water had sunk to the knees of the two foremost men when a strap snapped on one nearest the cart His pack swung suddenly to the side overbalancing him At the same instant the man next to him slipped and each jerked the other under The next two were whipped off their feet while the cart turning over swept from the bottom of the ford into the deep water The two men who had almost emerged threw themselves backward on the pull ropes The effort was heroic but giants though they were the task was too great and they were dragged inch by inch downward and under Their packs held them to the bottom save him whose strap had broken This one struck out not to the shore but down the stream striving to keep up with his comrades A couple of hundred feet below the rapid dashed over a toothed reef of rocks and here a minute later they appeared The cart still loaded showed first smashing a wheel and turning over and over into the next plunge The men followed in a miserable tangle They were beaten against the submerged rocks and swept on all but one Frona in a canoe a dozen canoes were already in pursuit saw him grip the rock with bleeding fingers She saw his white face and the agony of the effort but his hold relaxed and he was jerked away just as his free comrade swimming mightily was reaching for him Hidden from sight they took the next plunge showing for a second still struggling at the shallow foot of the rapid A canoe picked up the swimming man but the rest disappeared in a long stretch of swift deep water For a quarter of an hour the canoes plied fruitlessly about then found the dead men gently grounded in an eddy A tow rope was requisitioned from an up coming boat and a pair of horses from a pack train on the bank and the ghastly jetsam hauled ashore Frona looked at the five young giants lying in the mud broken boned limp uncaring They were still harnessed to the cart and the poor worthless packs still clung to their backs The sixth sat in the midst dry eyed and stunned A dozen feet away the steady flood of life flowed by and Frona melted into it and went on The dark spruce shrouded mountains drew close together in the Dyea Canyon and the feet of men churned the wet sunless earth into mire and bog hole And when they had done this they sought new paths till there were many paths And on such a path Frona came upon a man spread carelessly in the mud He lay on his side legs apart and one arm buried beneath him pinned down by a bulky pack His cheek was pillowed restfully in the ooze and on his face there was an expression of content He brightened when he saw her and his eyes twinkled cheerily Bout time you hove along he greeted her Been waitin an hour on you as it is That s it as Frona bent over him Just unbuckle that strap The pesky thing Twas just out o my reach all the time Are you hurt she asked He slipped out of his straps shook himself and felt the twisted arm Nope Sound as a dollar thank you And no kick to register either He reached over and wiped his muddy hands on a low bowed spruce Just my luck but I got a good rest so what s the good of makin a beef about it You see I tripped on that little root there and slip slump slam and slush there I was down and out and the buckle just out o reach And there I lay for a blasted hour everybody hitting the lower path But why didn t you call out to them And make em climb up the hill to me Them all tuckered out with their own work Not on your life Wasn t serious enough If any other man d make me climb up just because he d slipped down I d take him out o the mud all right all right and punch and punch him back into the mud again Besides I knew somebody was bound to come along my way after a while Oh you ll do she cried appropriating Del Bishop s phrase You ll do for this country Yep he called back shouldering his pack and starting off at a lively clip And anyway I got a good rest The trail dipped through a precipitous morass to the river s brink A slender pine tree spanned the screaming foam and bent midway to touch the water The surge beat upon the taper trunk and gave it a rhythmical swaying motion while the feet of the packers had worn smooth its wave washed surface Eighty feet it stretched in ticklish insecurity Frona stepped upon it felt it move beneath her heard the bellowing of the water saw the mad rush and shrank back She slipped the knot of her shoe laces and pretended great care in the tying thereof as a bunch of Indians came out of the woods above and down through the mud Three or four bucks led the way followed by many squaws all bending in the head straps to the heavy packs Behind came the children burdened according to their years and in the rear half a dozen dogs tongues lagging out and dragging forward painfully under their several loads The men glanced at her sideways and one of them said something in an undertone Frona could not hear but the snicker which went down the line brought the flush of shame to her brow and told her more forcibly than could the words Her face was hot for she sat disgraced in her own sight but she gave no sign The leader stood aside and one by one and never more than one at a time they made the perilous passage At the bend in the middle their weight forced the tree under and they felt for their footing up to the ankles in the cold driving torrent Even the little children made it without hesitancy and then the dogs whining and reluctant but urged on by the man When the last had crossed over he turned to Frona Um horse trail he said pointing up the mountain side Much better you take um horse trail More far much better But she shook her head and waited till he reached the farther bank for she felt the call not only upon her own pride but upon the pride of her race and it was a greater demand than her demand just as the race was greater than she So she put foot upon the log and with the eyes of the alien people upon her walked down into the foam white swirl She came upon a man weeping by the side of the trail His pack clumsily strapped sprawled on the ground He had taken off a shoe and one naked foot showed swollen and blistered What is the matter she asked halting before him He looked up at her then down into the depths where the Dyea River cut the gloomy darkness with its living silver The tears still welled in his eyes and he sniffled What is the matter she repeated Can I be of any help No he replied How can you help My feet are raw and my back is nearly broken and I am all tired out Can you help any of these things Well judiciously I am sure it might be worse Think of the men who have just landed on the beach It will take them ten days or two weeks to back trip their outfits as far as you have already got yours But my partners have left me and gone on he moaned a sneaking appeal for pity in his voice And I am all alone and I don t feel able to move another step And then think of my wife and babies I left them down in the States Oh if they could only see me now I can t go back to them and I can t go on It s too much for me I can t stand it this working like a horse I was not made to work like a horse I ll die I know I will if I do Oh what shall I do What shall I do Why did your comrades leave you Because I was not so strong as they because I could not pack as much or as long And they laughed at me and left me Have you ever roughed it Frona asked No You look well put up and strong Weigh probably one hundred and sixty five One hundred and seventy he corrected You don t look as though you had ever been troubled with sickness Never an invalid N no And your comrades They are miners Never mining in their lives They worked in the same establishment with me That s what makes it so hard don t you see We d known one another for years And to go off and leave me just because I couldn t keep up My friend and Frona knew she was speaking for the race you are strong as they You can work just as hard as they pack as much But you are weak of heart This is no place for the weak of heart You cannot work like a horse because you will not Therefore the country has no use for you The north wants strong men strong of soul not body The body does not count So go back to the States We do not want you here If you come you will die and what then of your wife and babies So sell out your outfit and go back You will be home in three weeks Good by She passed through Sheep Camp Somewhere above a mighty glacier under the pent pressure of a subterranean reservoir had burst asunder and hurled a hundred thousand tons of ice and water down the rocky gorge The trail was yet slippery with the slime of the flood and men were rummaging disconsolately in the rubbish of overthrown tents and caches But here and there they worked with nervous haste and the stark corpses by the trail side attested dumbly to their labor A few hundred yards beyond the work of the rush went on uninterrupted Men rested their packs on jutting stones swapped escapes whilst they regained their breath then stumbled on to their toil again The mid day sun beat down upon the stone Scales The forest had given up the struggle and the dizzying heat recoiled from the unclothed rock On either hand rose the ice marred ribs of earth naked and strenuous in their nakedness Above towered storm beaten Chilcoot Up its gaunt and ragged front crawled a slender string of men But it was an endless string It came out of the last fringe of dwarfed shrub below drew a black line across a dazzling stretch of ice and filed past Frona where she ate her lunch by the way And it went on up the pitch of the steep growing fainter and smaller till it squirmed and twisted like a column of ants and vanished over the crest of the pass Even as she looked Chilcoot was wrapped in rolling mist and whirling cloud and a storm of sleet and wind roared down upon the toiling pigmies The light was swept out of the day and a deep gloom prevailed but Frona knew that somewhere up there clinging and climbing and immortally striving the long line of ants still twisted towards the sky And she thrilled at the thought strong with man s ancient love of mastery and stepped into the line which came out of the storm behind and disappeared into the storm before She blew through the gap of the pass in a whirlwind of vapor with hand and foot clambered down the volcanic ruin of Chilcoot s mighty father and stood on the bleak edge of the lake which filled the pit of the crater The lake was angry and white capped and though a hundred caches were waiting ferriage no boats were plying back and forth A rickety skeleton of sticks in a shell of greased canvas lay upon the rocks Frona sought out the owner a bright faced young fellow with sharp black eyes and a salient jaw Yes he was the ferryman but he had quit work for the day Water too rough for freighting He charged twenty five dollars for passengers but he was not taking passengers to day Had he not said it was too rough That was why But you will take me surely she asked He shook his head and gazed out over the lake At the far end it s rougher than you see it here Even the big wooden boats won t tackle it The last that tried with a gang of packers aboard was blown over on the west shore We could see them plainly And as there s no trail around from there they ll have to camp it out till the blow is over But they re better off than I am My camp outfit is at Happy Camp and I can t very well stay here Frona smiled winsomely but there was no appeal in the smile no feminine helplessness throwing itself on the strength and chivalry of the male Do reconsider and take me across No I ll give you fifty No I say But I m not afraid you know The young fellow s eyes flashed angrily He turned upon her suddenly but on second thought did not utter the words forming on his lips She realized the unintentional slur she had cast and was about to explain But on second thought she too remained silent for she read him and knew that it was perhaps the only way for her to gain her point They stood there bodies inclined to the storm in the manner of seamen on sloped decks unyieldingly looking into each other s eyes His hair was plastered in wet ringlets on his forehead while hers in longer wisps beat furiously about her face Come on then He flung the boat into the water with an angry jerk and tossed the oars aboard Climb in I ll take you but not for your fifty dollars You pay the regulation price and that s all A gust of the gale caught the light shell and swept it broadside for a score of feet The spray drove inboard in a continuous stinging shower and Frona at once fell to work with the bailing can I hope we re blown ashore he shouted stooping forward to the oars It would be embarrassing for you He looked up savagely into her face No she modified but it would be very miserable for both of us a night without tent blankets or fire Besides we re not going to blow ashore She stepped out on the slippery rocks and helped him heave up the canvas craft and tilt the water out On either side uprose bare wet walls of rock A heavy sleet was falling steadily through which a few streaming caches showed in the gathering darkness You d better hurry up he advised thanking her for the assistance and relaunching the boat Two miles of stiff trail from here to Happy Camp No wood until you get there so you d best hustle along Good by Frona reached out and took his hand and said You are a brave man Oh I don t know He returned the grip with usury and looked his admiration A dozen tents held grimly to their pegs on the extreme edge of the timber line at Happy Camp Frona weary with the day went from tent to tent Her wet skirts clung heavily to her tired limbs while the wind buffeted her brutally about Once through a canvas wall she heard a man apostrophizing gorgeously and felt sure that it was Del Bishop But a peep into the interior told a different tale so she wandered fruitlessly on till she reached the last tent in the camp She untied the flap and looked in A spluttering candle showed the one occupant a man down on his knees and
