Esteban went about his plan of destroying Pancho Cueto with youthful energy and zest First he secured at some pains a half stick of dynamite a cap and fuse and a gallon or more of kerosene then he assembled his followers and led them once again into the San Juan This time the ride to La Joya was longer than before and since every member of the little band was proscribed Esteban insisted upon the greatest caution But there was little need of especial care for the country was already depopulated as a result of Weyler s proclamation Fields were empty houses silent no living creatures stirred except in the tree tops and the very birds seemed frightened subdued It struck young Varona queerly It was as if the whole land was in mourning he saw nothing but blackbirds somber hued vultures dismal Judea birds with their ebony plumage and yellow beaks Far up the valley a funeral pall of smoke hung in the sky itself that was where the Spaniards were burning the houses of those too slow in obeying the order of concentration La Joya however was still tenanted when early in the evening its rightful owner arrived the house and some of its outbuildings showed lights Esteban concealed his men While the horses cropped and the negroes rested he fitted fuse and cap to his precious piece of dynamite It was likely he thought that Cueto had provided himself with a body guard and knowing the plantation house as he did he had no intention of battering weakly at its stout ironwood door while his quarry took fright and slipped away Now while Esteban was thus busied Pancho Cueto was entertaining an unwelcome guest In the late afternoon he had been surprised by the visit of a dozen or more Volunteers and inasmuch as his relations with their colonel had been none of the friendliest since that ill starred expedition into the Yumuri he had felt a chill of apprehension on seeing the redoubtable Cobo himself at their head The colonel had explained that he was returning from a trip up the San Juan taken for the purpose of rounding up those inhabitants who had been dilatory in obeying the new orders from Havana That smoke to the southward was from fires of his kindling he had burned a good many crops and houses and punished a good many people and since this was exactly the sort of task he liked he was in no unpleasant mood He had demanded of Cueto lodging for himself and his troop announcing that a part of his command was somewhere behind and would rejoin him later in the night Cueto had welcomed his visitor in all humility he put up the soldiers in the bate of the sugar mill and then installed Cobo in his best room after which he ransacked the house for food and drink and tobacco Later he and the colonel sat long over their supper for the latter s exultant humor continued Cobo it transpired was delighted with the new captain general a man of blood and iron a man after his own heart This Weyler he predicted would put an end to the insurrection there would be no more of Campos s weak merciful methods which were in reality nothing less than encouragement to revolt Cueto of course agreed We re sweeping the country as with a broom and already Matanzas is bulging with refugees the officer told him They call themselves pacificos but they carry information and aid our enemies We ll have no more of that Will it not be a great expense to feed so many people Cueto ventured Let them feed themselves Is it our fault that they make such measures necessary By no means Once we have them safe we shall exterminate all whom we encounter in the country The speaker drank deeply of Cueto s good wine and smacked his lips It s the kind of work I like Extermination They have had their warning From now on we shall spare neither man woman nor child The men are traitors the women breed and the children grow up Cueto nodded his complete approval of this program Oh decidedly said he This spirit of violence must be stamped out or none of us will be safe Let me tell you I myself live in constant dread of that young villain Varona I hope you haven t forgotten him Forgotten him Colonel Cobo fingered a lately healed scar which further disfigured his ugly face then he cursed frightfully It s by God s mercy alone that I m alive to night And I haven t forgotten the girl either She ll have to come in along with the others The boy may stay out but she can t He licked his lips Wait until I have finished with this valley I ll drive the Yumuri next as a hunter drives a thicket for his game and nothing will slip through His thoughts once turned upon Rosa the colonel could talk of little else and Cueto realized that the girl had indeed made a deep impression upon him The overseer was well pleased and when Cobo finally took himself off to bed he followed in better spirits than he had enjoyed for some time For one thing it was agreeable to look forward to a night of undisturbed repose Pancho s apprehensions had fattened upon themselves and he had been living of late in a nightmare of terror But it seemed to him that he had barely closed his eyes when he was awakened by a tremendous vibration and found himself in the center of the floor undecided whether he had been hurled from his bed or whether he had leaped thither Still in a daze he heard a shout from the direction of Cobo s room then a din of other voices followed by a rush of feet the next instant his door was flung back and he saw by the light of high held torches Esteban Varona and a ragged rabble of black men Cueto knew that he faced death He uttered a shrill scream of terror and seizing the revolver which was always close at his hand he fired blindly Then his foes were upon him What happened thereafter took but an instant He dodged a blow from Esteban s clubbed rifle only to behold the flash of a machete Crying out again he tried to guard himself from the descending blade but too late the sound of his hoarse terror died in his throat half born Quick Soak the bed with oil and fire it Esteban directed then he ran out into the hall to investigate that other shouting He found the chamber whence it issued and tried to smash the door but at the second blow he heard a gun shot from within and the wood splintered outward almost into his face Simultaneously from somewhere outside the house arose the notes of a Spanish bugle call Young Varona waited to hear no more Nor did his men realizing the peril into which they had been led they bolted from the house as fast as they could go There was no need for questions from the direction of the sugar mill came bellowed orders and the sound of men shouting to their horses Evidently those were troops and trained troops too for they took no time to saddle they were up and mounted almost before the marauders had gained the backs of their own animals There was no opportunity to choose a retreat across the fields Esteban spurred down the driveway toward the main calzada yelling to his men to follow him The approach to La Joya was by way of a notable avenue perhaps a half mile in length and bordered by tall even rows of royal palms These stately trees shaded the avenue by day and lent it a cavern like gloom by night Near the public causeway the road was cut through a bit of rising ground and was walled by steep banks overgrown with vines Into the black tunnel formed by the palms the fugitives plunged with the clatter of hoofs close behind them Those of the Volunteers who pressed them hardest began to shoot wildly for this typically Cuban refusal to stand ground enraged them beyond measure Esteban s party would doubtless have made good their escape had it not been for that other guerrillero returning from its raid but as it happened the two forces met in the sunken road Nothing but the darkness and the head long approach of the fleeing men saved them from immediate destruction for the collision occurred between banks too steep for a horse to climb and with that yelling pack too close behind to permit of retreat Instantly there began a blind battle in these desperately cramped quarters After the first moment or two friend and foe were indistinguishable and the men of both parties began firing or thrusting at whatever loomed nearest out of the gloom The narrow ravine quickly became a place of utter confusion a volcano of blasphemies a press of jostling plunging struggling bodies Horses reared and bit at one another Riders fought stirrup to stirrup with clubbed rifles and machetes saddles were emptied and the terrified horses bolted Some of them lunged up the banks only to tumble down again their threshing limbs and sharp shod hoofs working more havoc than blows from old time battle hammers Meanwhile those of Cobo s men who had ridden out from the sugar mill naturally attributed this new uproar to a stand of their enemies and began to rake the road with rifle fire then in obedience to the commands of their half clad colonel they charged A moment and they were fighting hand to hand with their returning comrades Spaniard clashed with Spaniard and somewhere in the melee the six marauders battled for their lives Of course after the first moment of conflict Esteban had not been able to exert the least control over his men in fact he could not make himself heard Nor could he spare the breath to shout he was too desperately engaged When the full truth of the situation dawned upon him he gave up hope for his life and at first merely strove to wreak such havoc as he could Yet while some of his faculties were completely numbed in the stress of that white hot moment others remained singularly clear The shock of his surprise the imminence of his peril rendered him dead to any emotion save dismay and yet strangely enough he remembered Rosa s pressing need for him and more for her sake than for his own fought to extricate himself from the confusion His rifle was empty he had its hot barrel in his hands he dimly distinguished Asensio wielding his machete Then he found himself down and half stunned He was running here and there to avoid lunging horses he was tripping and falling but meanwhile as opportunity offered he continued to use his clubbed weapon Something smote him heavily at last whether a hoof or a gun stock he could not tell and next he was on all fours trying to drag himself out of this rat pit But his limbs were queerly rebellious and he was sick he had never experienced anything quite like this and he thought he must be wounded It greatly surprised him to find that he could struggle upward through the brambles even though it was hard work Men were fighting all around and below him meanwhile and he wondered vaguely what made them kill one another when he and his negroes were all dead or dying It seemed very strange of a piece with the general unreality of things and it troubled him not a little At last he gained the top of the bank and managed to assume an upright position clinging to the bole of a palm tree One of his arms was useless he discovered and he realized with a curious shock that it was broken He was bleeding too from more than one wound but he could walk after a fashion He was inclined to stay and finish the fight but he recollected that Rosa would be waiting for him and that he must go to her and so he set out across the fields staggering through the charred cane stubble The night was not so black as it had been and this puzzled him until he saw that the plantation house was ablaze Flames were belching from its windows casting abroad a lurid radiance and remembering Pancho Cueto Esteban laughed By and by after he was well away his numbness passed and he began to suffer excruciating pain The pain had been there all the time so it seemed he was simply gaining the capacity to feel it He was ready to die now he was so ill moreover his left arm dangled and got in his way Only that subconscious realization of the necessity to keep going for Rosa s sake sustained him After a while he found himself on a forest trail then he came to other fields and labored across them Fortune finally led his feet down into a creek bed and he drank greedily sitting upon a stone and scooping the water up in his one useful hand He was a long time in quenching his thirst and a longer time in getting up but he finally managed this and he succeeded thereafter in keeping on his feet Daylight came at last to show him his way More than once he paused alarmed at voices in the woods only to find that the sounds issued from his own throat It had grown very hot now so hot that heat waves obscured his vision and caused the most absurd forms to take shape He began to hunt aimlessly for water but there was none Evidently this heat had parched the land dried up the streams and set the stones afire It was incredible but true Esteban reasoned that he must be near home by this time for he had been traveling for days for years The country indeed was altogether unfamiliar he could not recall ever having seen the path he trod but for that matter everything was strange In the first place he knew that he was going west and yet the morning sun persisted in beating hotly into his face That alone convinced him that things had gone awry with the world He could remember a great convulsion of some sort but just what it was he had no clear idea Evidently though it had been sufficient to change the rotation of the earth Yes that was it the earth was running backward upon its axis he could actually feel it whirling under his feet No wonder his journey seemed so long He was laboring over a gigantic treadmill balancing like an equilibrist upon a revolving sphere Well it was a simple matter to stop walking sit down and allow himself to be spun backward around to the place where Rosa was waiting He pondered this idea for some time until its absurdity became apparent Undoubtedly he must be going out of his head he saw that it was necessary to keep walking until the back spin of that treadmill brought Rosa to him But the time came when he could walk no farther He tried repeatedly and failed and meanwhile the earth spun even more rapidly threatening to whirl him off into space It was a terrible sensation he lay down and hugged the ground clinging to roots and sobbing weakly Rosa he knew was just around the next bend in the trail he called to her but she did not answer and he dared not attempt to creep forward because his grip was failing He could feel his fingers slipping slipping It was agony He summoned his last atom of determination but to no avail He gave up finally and felt himself propelled dizzily outward into immeasurable voids His last thought as he went whirling end over end through space was of his sister
