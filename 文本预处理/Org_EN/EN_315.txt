The last word of the blessing was scarce out of the minister s mouth before Stewart had me by the arm We were the first to be forth of the church and he made such extraordinary expedition that we were safe within the four walls of a house before the street had begun to be thronged with the home going congregation Am I yet in time I asked Ay and no said he The case is over the jury is enclosed and will be so kind as let us ken their view of it to morrow in the morning the same as I could have told it my own self three days ago before the play began The thing has been public from the start The panel kent it Ye may do what ye will for me whispers he two days ago I ken my fate by what the Duke of Argyle has just said to Mr Macintosh O it s been a scandal The great Argyle he gaed before He gart the cannons and guns to roar and the very macer cried Cruachan But now that [pg ]I have got you again I ll never despair The oak shall go over the myrtle yet we ll ding the Campbells yet in their own town Praise God that I should see the day He was leaping with excitement emptied out his mails upon the floor that I might have a change of clothes and incommoded me with his assistance as I changed What remained to be done or how I was to do it was what he never told me nor I believe so much as thought of We ll ding the Camphells yet that was still his overcome And it was forced home upon my mind how this that had the externals of a sober process of law was in its essence a clan battle between savage clans I thought my friend the Writer none of the least savage Who that had only seen him at a counsel s back before the Lord Ordinary or following a golf ball and laying down his clubs on Bruntsfield links could have recognised for the same person this voluble and violent clansman James Stewart s counsel were four in number Sheriffs Brown of Colstoun and Miller Mr Robert Macintosh and Mr Stewart younger of Stewart Hall These were covenanted to dine with the Writer after sermon and I was very obligingly included of the party No sooner the cloth lifted and the first bowl very artfully compounded by Sheriff Miller than we fell to the subject in hand I made a short narration of my seizure and captivity and was then examined [pg ]and re examined upon the circumstances of the murder It will be remembered this was the first time I had had my say out or the matter at all handled among lawyers and the consequence was very dispiriting to the others and I must own disappointing to myself To sum up said Colstoun you prove that Alan was on the spot you have heard him proffer menaces against Glenure and though you assure us he was not the man who fired you leave a strong impression that he was in league with him and consenting perhaps immediately assisting in the act You show him besides at the risk of his own liberty actively furthering the criminal s escape And the rest of your testimony so far as the least material depends on the bare word of Alan or of James the two accused In short you do not at all break but only lengthen by one personage the chain that binds our client to the murderer and I need scarcely say that the introduction of a third accomplice rather aggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has been our stumbling block from the beginning I am of the same opinion said Sheriff Miller I think we may all be very much obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable witness out of our way And chiefly I think Mr Balfour himself might be obliged For you talk of a third accomplice but Mr Balfour in my view has very much the appearance of a fourth [pg ] Allow me sirs interposed Stewart the Writer There is another view Here we have a witness never fash whether material or not a witness in this cause kidnapped by that old lawless bandit crew of the Glengyle Macgregors and sequestered for near upon a month in a bourock of old cold ruins on the Bass Move that and see what dirt you fling on the proceedings Sirs this is a tale to make the world ring with It would be strange with such a grip as this if we couldnae squeeze out a pardon for my client And suppose we took up Mr Balfour s cause to morrow said Stewart Hall I am much deceived or we should find so many impediments thrown in our path as that James should have been hanged before we had found a court to hear us This is a great scandal but I suppose we have none of us forgot a greater still I mean the matter of the Lady Grange The woman was still in durance my friend Mr Hope of Rankeillor did what was humanly possible and how did he speed He never got a warrant Well it ll be the same now the same weapons will be used This is a scene gentlemen of clan animosity The hatred of the name which I have the honor to bear rages in high quarters There is nothing here to be viewed but naked Campbell spite and scurvy Campbell intrigue You may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic and I sat for some time in the midst of my learned [pg ]counsel almost deaved with their talk but extremely little the wiser for its purport The Writer was led into some hot expressions Colstoun must take him up and set him right the rest joined in on different sides but all pretty noisy the Duke of Argyle was beaten like a blanket King George came in for a few digs in the by going and a great deal of rather elaborate defence and there was only one person that seemed to be forgotten and that was James of the Glens Through all this Mr Miller sat quiet He was a slip of an oldish gentleman ruddy and twinkling he spoke in a smooth rich voice with an infinite effect of pawkiness dealing out each word the way an actor does to give the most expression possible and even now when he was silent and sat there with his wig laid aside his glass in both hands his mouth funnily pursed and his chin out he seemed the mere picture of a merry slyness It was plain he had a word to say and waited for the fit occasion It came presently Colstoun had wound up one of his speeches with some expression of their duty to their client His brother sheriff was pleased I suppose with the transition He took the table in his confidence with a gesture and a look That suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked said he The interest of our client goes certainly before all but the world does not come to an end with James Stewart Whereat he cocked his eye [pg ] I might condescend exempli gratia upon a Mr George Brown a Mr Thomas Miller and a Mr David Balfour Mr David Balfour has a very good ground of complaint and I think gentlemen if his story was properly red out I think there would be a number of wigs on the green The whole table turned to him with a common movement Properly handled and carefully red out his is a story that could scarcely fail to have some consequence he continued The whole administration of justice from its highest officer downward would be totally discredited and it looks to me as if they would need to be replaced He seemed to shine with cunning as he said it And I need not point out to ye that this of Mr Balfour s would be a remarkable bonny cause to appear in he added Well there they all were started on another hare Mr Balfour s cause and what kind of speeches could be there delivered and what officials could be thus turned out and who would succeed to their positions I shall give but the two specimens It was proposed to approach Symon Fraser whose testimony if it could be obtained could prove certainly fatal to Argyle and Prestongrange Miller highly approved of the attempt We have here before us a dreeping roast said he here is cut and come again for all And methought all licked their lips The other was already near the [pg ]end Stewart the Writer was out of the body with delight smelling vengeance on his chief enemy the Duke Gentlemen cried he charging his glass here is to Sheriff Miller His legal abilities are known to all His culinary this bowl in front of us is here to speak for But when it comes to the poleetical cries he and drains the glass Ay but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning my friend said the gratified Miller A revolution if you like and I think I can promise you that historical writers shall date from Mr Balfour s cause But properly guided Mr Stewart tenderly guided it shall prove a peaceful revolution And if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed what care I cries Stewart smiting down his fist It will be thought I was not very well pleased with all this though I could scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency in these old intriguers But it was not my view to have undergone so many sorrows for the advancement of Sheriff Miller or to make a revolution in the Parliament House and I interposed accordingly with as much simplicity of manner as I could assume I have to thank you gentlemen for your advice said I And now I would like by your leave to set you two or three questions There is one thing that has fallen rather on one side for instance Will this cause do any good to our friend James of the Glens [pg ]They seemed all a hair set back and gave various answers but concurring practically in one point that James had now no hope but in the King s mercy To proceed then said I will it do any good to Scotland We have a saying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest I remember hearing we had a riot in Edinburgh when I was an infant child which gave occasion to the late Queen to call this country barbarous and I always understood that we had rather lost than gained by that Then came the year Forty five which made Scotland to be talked of everywhere but I never heard it said we had anyway gained by the Forty five And now we come to this cause of Mr Balfour s as you call it Sheriff Miller tells us historical writers are to date from it and I would not wonder It is only my fear they would date from it as a period of calamity and public reproach The nimble witted Miller had already smelt where I was travelling to and made haste to get on the same road Forcibly put Mr Balfour says he A weighty observe sir We have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for King George I pursued Sheriff Miller appears pretty easy upon this but I doubt you will scarce be able to pull down the house from under him without his Majesty coming by a knock or two one of which might easily prove fatal I gave them a chance to answer but none volunteered [pg ] Of those for whom the case was to be profitable I went on Sheriff Miller gave us the names of several among the which he was good enough to mention mine I hope he will pardon me if I think otherwise I believe I hung not the least back in this affair while there was life to be saved but I own I thought myself extremely hazarded and I own I think it would be a pity for a young man with some idea of coming to the bar to ingrain upon himself the character of a turbulent factious fellow before he was yet twenty As for James it seems at this date of the proceedings with the sentence as good as pronounced he has no hope but in the King s mercy May not his Majesty then be more pointedly addressed the characters of these high officers sheltered from the public and myself kept out of a position which I think spells ruin for me They all sat and gazed into their glasses and I could see they found my attitude on the affair unpalatable But Miller was ready at all events If I may be allowed to put our young friend s notion in more formal shape says he I understand him to propose that we should embody the fact of his sequestration and perhaps some heads of the testimony he was prepared to offer in a memorial to the Crown This plan has elements of success It is as likely as any other and perhaps likelier to help our client Perhaps his Majesty would have the goodness to feel a certain gratitude to all concerned in such a memorial [pg ]which might be construed into an expression of a very delicate loyalty and I think in the drafting of the same this view might be brought forward They all nodded to each other not without sighs for the former alternative was doubtless more after their inclination Paper then Mr Stewart if you please pursued Miller and I think it might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here present as procurators for the condemned man It can do none of us any harm at least says Colstoun heaving another sigh for he had seen himself Lord Advocate the last ten minutes Thereupon they set themselves not very enthusiastically to draft the memorial a process in the course of which they soon caught fire and I had no more ado but to sit looking on and answer an occasional question The paper was very well expressed beginning with a recitation of the facts about myself the reward offered for my apprehension my surrender the pressure brought to bear upon me my sequestration and my arrival at Inverary in time to be too late going on to explain the reasons of loyalty and public interest for which it was agreed to waive any right of action and winding up with a forcible appeal to the King s mercy on behalf of James Methought I was a good deal sacrificed and rather represented in the light of a firebrand of a fellow whom [pg ]my cloud of lawyers had restrained with difficulty from extremes But I let it pass and made but the one suggestion that I should be described as ready to deliver my own evidence and adduce that of others before any commission of inquiry and the one demand that I should be immediately furnished with a copy Colstoun hummed and hawed This is a very confidential document said he And my position towards Prestongrange is highly peculiar I replied No question but I must have touched his heart at our first interview so that he has since stood my friend consistently But for him gentlemen I must now be lying dead or awaiting my sentence alongside poor James For which reason I choose to communicate to him the fact of this memorial as soon as it is copied You are to consider also that this step will make for my protection I have enemies here accustomed to drive hard his Grace is in his own country Lovat by his side and if there should hang any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might very well awake in gaol Not finding any very ready answer to these considerations my company of advisers were at the last persuaded to consent and made only this condition that I was to lay the paper before Prestongrange with the express compliments of all concerned The Advocate was at the castle dining with his Grace By the hand of one of Colstoun s servants I [pg ]sent him a billet asking for an interview and received a summons to meet him at once in a private house of the town Here I found him alone in a chamber from his face there was nothing to be gleaned yet I was not so unobservant but what I spied some halberts in the hall and not so stupid but what I could gather he was prepared to arrest me there and then should it appear advisable So Mr David this is you said he Where I fear I am not overly welcome my lord said I And I would like before I go further to express my sense of your lordship s continued good offices even should they now cease I have heard of your gratitude before he replied drily and I think this can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to listen to I would remember also if I were you that you still stand on a very boggy foundation Not now my lord I think said I and if your lordship will but glance an eye along this you will perhaps think as I do He read it sedulously through frowning heavily then turned back to one part and another which he seemed to weigh and compare the effect of His face a little lightened This is not so bad but what it might be worse said he though I am still likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with Mr David Balfour [pg ] Rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man my lord said I He still skimmed the paper and all the while his spirits seemed to mend And to whom am I indebted for this he asked presently Other counsels must have been discussed I think Who was it proposed this private method Was it Miller My lord it was myself said I These gentlemen have shown me no such consideration as that I should deny myself any credit I can fairly claim or spare them any responsibility they should properly bear And the mere truth is that they were all in favour of a process which should have remarkable consequences in the Parliament House and prove for them in one of their own expressions a dripping roast Before I intervened I think they were on the point of sharing out the different law appointments Our friend Mr Symon was to be taken in upon some composition Prestongrange smiled These are our friends said he And what were your reasons for dissenting Mr David I told them without concealment expressing however with more force and volume those which regarded Prestongrange himself You do me no more than justice said he I have fought as hard in your interest as you have fought [pg ]against mine And how came you here to day he asked As the case drew out I began to grow uneasy that I had clipped the period so fine and I was even expecting you to morrow But to day I never dreamed of it I was not of course going to betray Andie I suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road said I If I had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted longer of the Bass says he Speaking of which my lord I return your letter And I gave him the enclosure in the counterfeit hand There was the cover also with the seal said he I have it not said I It bore naught but the address and could not compromise a cat The second enclosure I have and with your permission I desire to keep it I thought he winced a little but he said nothing to the point To morrow he resumed our business here is to be finished and I proceed by Glasgow I would be very glad to have you of my party Mr David My lord I began I do not deny it will be of service to me he interrupted I desire even that when we shall come to Edinburgh you should alight at my house You have very warm friends in the Miss Grants who will be overjoyed to have you to themselves If you think [pg ]I have been of use to you you can thus easily repay me and so far from losing may reap some advantage by the way It is not every strange young man who is presented in society by the King s Advocate Often enough already in our brief relations this gentleman had caused my head to spin no doubt but what for a moment he did so again now Here was the old fiction still maintained of my particular favour with his daughters one of whom had been so good as laugh at me while the other two had scarce deigned to remark the fact of my existence And now I was to ride with my lord to Glascow I was to dwell with him in Edinburgh I was to be brought into society under his protection That he should have so much good nature as to forgive me was surprising enough that he could wish to take me up and serve me seemed impossible and I began to seek for some ulterior meaning One was plain If I became his guest repentance was excluded I could never think better of my present design and bring any action And besides would not my presence in his house draw out the whole pungency of the memorial For that complaint could not be very seriously regarded if the person chiefly injured was the guest of the official most incriminated As I thought upon this I could not quite refrain from smiling This is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial said I [pg ] You are cunning Mr David said he and you do not wholly guess wrong the fact will be of use to me in my defence Perhaps however you underrate my friendly sentiments which are perfectly genuine I have a respect for you Mr David mingled with awe says he smiling I am more than willing I am earnestly desirous to meet your wishes said I It is my design to be called to the bar where your lordship s countenance would be invaluable and I am besides sincerely grateful to yourself and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence The difficulty is here There is one point in which we pull two ways You are trying to hang James Stewart I am trying to save him In so far as my riding with you would better your lordship s defence I am at your lordship s orders but in so far as it would help to hang James Stewart you see me at a stick I thought he swore to himself You should certainly be called the bar is the true scene for your talents says he bitterly and then fell a while silent I will tell you he presently resumed there is no question of James Stewart for or against James is a dead man his life is given and taken bought if you like it better and sold no memorial can help no defalcation of a faithful Mr David hurt him Blow high blow low there will be no pardon for James Stewart and take that for said The question is now [pg ]of myself am I to stand or fall and I do not deny to you that I am in some danger But will Mr David Balfour consider why It is not because I have pushed the case unduly against James for that I am sure of condonation And it is not because I have sequestered Mr David on a rock though it will pass under that colour but because I did not take the ready and plain path to which I was pressed repeatedly and send Mr David to his grave or to the gallows Hence the scandal hence this damned memorial striking the paper on his leg My tenderness for you has brought me in this difficulty I wish to know if your tenderness to your own conscience is too great to let you help me out of it No doubt but there was much of the truth in what he said if James was past helping whom was it more natural that I should turn to help than just the man before me who had helped myself so often and was even now setting me a pattern of patience I was besides not only weary but beginning to be ashamed of my perpetual attitude of suspicion and refusal If you will name the time and place I will be punctually ready to attend your lordship said I He shook hands with me And I think my misses have some news for you says he dismissing me I came away vastly pleased to have my peace made yet a little concerned in conscience nor could I help wondering as I went back whether perhaps I had [pg ]not been a scruple too good natured But there was the fact that this was a man that might have been my father an able man a great dignitary and one that in the hour of my need had reached a hand to my assistance I was in the better humour to enjoy the remainder of that evening which I passed with
