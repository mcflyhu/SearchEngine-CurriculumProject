The Saturday on which John Parfit came to see Eve was one of those premature spring days that makes one listen for the singing of birds The little front garden was full of sunlight and a few crocuses streaked the brown earth under the window The Bourgeois arrived with a great bunch of daffodils their succulent stems wrapped in blue tissue paper Well how are you now How are you Brought you a few flowers He was shy with the shyness of a big good natured creature who was slow to adapt himself to strange surroundings A feminine atmosphere had always rendered John Parfit nervous and inarticulate He could talk like a politician in an office or a railway carriage but thrust him into a drawing room with a few women and he became voiceless and futile Well how are we He put his top hat on the table and stood the flowers in it as though it were a vase But your poor hat Why what s the matter They are such sappy things I must thank you for all the flowers They helped me to get well He removed the daffodils and wandered round the room till he found an empty pot that agreed to rid him of them Don t you bother don t you get up I ll settle them all right He came back to the fire rubbing his hands and smiling The smile died a sudden death when he dared to take his first good look at Eve and with it much of his self consciousness seemed to vanish He sat down rather abruptly staring I say you have had a bad time I m afraid I have She looked thin and ill and shadowy and plain and her eyes were the eyes of one who was worried A tremulous something about her mouth the droop of her neck the light on her hair stirred in John Parfit an inarticulate compassion The man in him was challenged appealed to touched I say you ve been bad you know But I m getting better You re you re so white and thin He spoke in an awed voice his glance fixed on one of her hands that rested on the arm of her chair I wanted to have a talk you know But I shall tire you No She heard him draw a big breath Look here I m a fool at expressing myself but you ve been having a bad time I mean as to the money Beastly thing money I ve guessed that Seems impertinent of me but by George well I can t help it It s upset me seeing you like this It s made me start saying something I didn t mean to mention He was out of breath and sat watching her for one dumb inarticulate moment his hands clenched between his knees Look here you may think me a fool but I tell you one thing I can t stand the thought of a girl like you having to scrape and scramble I can t stand it And I shouldn t have had the cheek but for feeling like this I ll just blurt it out I ve been thinking of it for weeks Look here let me take care of you for life I mean I m not a bad sort and I don t think I shall be a selfish beast of a husband There s nothing I won t do to make you happy He sat on the edge of the chair his hands still clenched between his knees As for Eve she was distressed touched and perhaps humbled She told herself suddenly that she had not faced this man fairly that she had not foreseen what she ought to have foreseen The room felt close and hot I say I haven t offended you It mayn t seem quite sporting talking like this when you ve been ill but by George I couldn t help it She said very gently How could I be offended Don t you know that you are doing me a very great honour Oh I say do you mean it Of course Eve saw a hand come out tentatively and then recede and in a flash she understood what the possible nearness of this man meant to her She shivered and knew that in the intimate physical sense he would be hopelessly repellent She could not help it even though he had touched her spiritually and made her feel that there were elements of fineness in him that were worthy of any woman s trust He had been silent for some seconds and his emotions could not be stopped now that they were discovering expression Look here I m forty six and I m going bald but I m a bit of a boy still I was made to be married but somehow I didn t I ve done pretty well in business I ve saved about seven thousand pounds and I m making nine hundred a year You ought to know I m ready to do anything We could take a jolly little house out somewhere Richmond or Hampstead say the new garden place And I don t know why we shouldn t keep a little motor or a trap Of course I m telling you this because you ought to know I m running on ahead rather but it s of no consequence I only want you to know what s what He was out of breath again and she sat and stared at the fire His rush of words had confused her It was like being overwhelmed with food and water after one had been dying of hunger and thirst and fear in a desert His essential and half pathetic sincerity went to her heart nor could she help her gratitude going out to him Not for a moment did she think of him as a fat commonplace sentimentalist a middle aged fool who fell over his own feet when he tried to make love He was more than a good creature He was a man who had a right to self expression She rallied her will power I don t know what to say to you I suppose I am feeling very weak He rushed into self accusation There I ve been a selfish beast I oughtn t to have come and upset you like this But I couldn t help telling you I know It hasn t hurt me But you have offered me such a big thing that I am trying to realise it all I don t think I m made for marriage Oh don t say that I know I m a blundering idiot No no it is not you It is marriage You don t believe in marriage Not that I mean for myself I don t think I could make you understand why He looked puzzled and distressed It s my fault I couldn t do the thing delicately I m clumsy No no I have told you that it is not that Well you think it over Supposing we leave it till you get stronger But you are offering everything and I nothing Nonsense Besides I don t believe in marrying a woman with money I d rather have the business on my own back Of course I should settle two or three thousand on you you know so that you would have a little income for pin money I think that s only fair to a woman She coloured and felt guilty I think you are more generous than fair Don t say any more I ll I ll think it over He got up and seized his hat That s it that s it You think it over I m not one of those fellows who thinks that a woman is going to rush at him directly he says come It means a lot to a woman a dickens of a lot And you re not quite yourself yet are you It s awfully good of you to have listened He reached for her hand bent over it with cumbrous courtesy and covered up a sudden silence by getting out of the room as quickly as he could When John Parfit had gone Eve lay back in her chair with a feeling of intense languor All the strength and independence seemed to melt out of her and she lay like a tired child on the knees of circumstance And then it was that she was tempted tempted in this moment of weariness by the knowledge that a way of escape lay so very near She had been offered a protected life food shelter a generous allowance love leisure all that the orthodox woman is supposed to desire He was kind understanding in his way reliable a man whose common sense was to be trusted and he would take her away from this paltry scramble pilot her out of the crowd and give her an affection that would last Her intuition recognised the admirable husband in him This middle class man had a rich vein of sentiment running through his nature and he was not too clever or too critical to tire Dusk began to fall and the fire was burning low It was the hour for memories and into the dusk of that little suburban room glided a subtle sense of other presences and she found herself thinking of Canterton and the child If she were to have a child like Lynette But it could not be Lynette it could not be his child the child of that one man She sat up shocked and challenged What was she about to do Sell herself Promise to give something that it was not in her power to give Deceive a man who most honestly loved her It would be prostitution There was only one man living to whom she could have granted complete physical comradeship She was not made to be touched by other hands She rose and lit the gas and sat down at the table to write a letter She would tell John Parfit the truth put the shame of temptation out of her way It was not a long letter but it came straight from her heart No man could be offended by it hurt by it It was human honourable a tribute to the man to whom it was written When she had addressed and stamped it she rang the bell for Mrs Buss I should be very much obliged if you could have this posted for me Mrs Buss was affable having smelt matrimony and safe money Certainly miss I ll send Albert down to the pillar box Excuse
