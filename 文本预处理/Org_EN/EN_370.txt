Lizzie Straker and Joan Gaunt were at supper when Eve walked into their private sitting room at the Black Boar Eight o clock had struck but the window of the room faced west and the lamp on the table had not been lit You re pretty late Eve sat down without taking off her hat She had a feeling that these two had been discussing her just before she had come into the room and that things which she was not expected to see had been so to speak pushed hurriedly under the sofa I ve had a long ramble and I m hungry She found a round of cold beef and a dish of young lettuces on the table Her companions had got as far as milk pudding and stewed rhubarb You must have been walking about four solid hours Did you get lost No I used to live down here They stared Oh did you You ve got pretty hot anyhow I walked fast I went farther than I meant to Meet any friends One or two She caught a pair of mistrustful eyes fixed on her They belonged to Joan Gaunt who sat at the end of the table I think we ll have the lamp Lizzie Right oh or Eve won t be able to hunt the slugs out of the lettuces Don t be beastly You might cut me a piece of bread The lamp was lit The other two had finished their supper but appeared inclined to sit there and watch Eve eat You met some old friends Yes I hope you were careful Of course I told them I was on a walking tour I dare say I shan t see them again No I don t think you d better Something in Joan Gaunt s voice annoyed her It was quietly but harshly dictatorial and Eve stiffened I don t think you need worry I can look after my own affairs Did you live in Basingford No Out in the country Lizzie Straker and Joan Gaunt exchanged glances Something had happened to the woman in Eve a something that was so patent and yet so mysterious that even these two fanatics noticed it and were puzzled Had she looked into a mirror before entering the sitting room she would have been struck by a physical transfiguration of which she was for the moment unconscious She had changed into a more spring like and more sensitive study of herself There was the indefinable suggestion of bloom upon fruit Her face looked fuller her skin more soft her lips redder her eyes brighter yet more elusive She had been bathing in deep and magic waters and had emerged with a shy tenderness hovering about her mouth and an air of sensuous radiance Supper was cleared away The lamp was replaced on the table Joan Gaunt brought out a note book and her cypher written itinerary Lizzie Straker lit a cigarette Business They exchanged glances Come along Eve Somehow the name seemed to strike all three of them with symbolical suggestiveness Her comrades looked at her mistrustfully They sat down at the table As you happen to know people here you had better be on your guard There is work to be done here I have just wired to Galahad Eve met Joan Gaunt s eyes Are there black sheep in Basingford A particularly black one An anti suffrage lunatic She has been on platforms against us That makes one feel bitter So it s a she She s a traitress a fool I wonder if I know her name It s Canterton Mrs James Canterton Eve was leaning her elbows on the table trying not to show how this news affected her And suddenly she began to laugh Joan Gaunt s face stiffened What are you laughing at It was wholesome helpless exquisite laughter that escaped and bubbled over from a delicious sense of fun What an ironical comedy Eve did not realise the complete significance of what she said until she had said it Why I should have thought she was one of us Her two comrades stared They were becoming more and more puzzled by this feminine thing that did not shape as they expected it to shape I don t see anything to laugh at Eve did But she ought to belong to us You seem to find it very funny I don t see anything funny about a woman being a political pimp for the men and a rotten sentimentalist I should never have called Mrs Canterton a sentimentalist Of course you know her A little Well she s marked down here with three asterisks That means trouble for her Of course she s married Yes And dotes on her husband and children and all that Eve grew serious No that s the strange part of it She and her husband don t run in double harness And she s a fool with her own child But that s absurd I suppose her husband has treated her badly as most of them do Oh I don t think so In nine cases out of ten it s the man s fault Perhaps this is the tenth Oh rot There s a man somewhere There must be someone else besides her husband or she wouldn t be talking for the men I don t think so If you knew Mrs Canterton you might understand Yet she doubted whether they would have understood for busybodies and extremists generally detest each other especially when they are arguing from opposite sides of the table Eve wanted to be alone to think things out to face this new crisis that had opened before her so suddenly It was the more dangerous and problematical since the strong current of her impulses flowed steadily towards Fernhill She went to bed early leaving Joan Gaunt and Lizzie Straker writing letters When the door had closed on Eve they put down their pens and looked at each other Something funny What s happened to her Lizzie Straker giggled She s met someone a man I suppose That s how it struck me Joan looked grim Don t giggle like that She has been puzzling me for a long time Once or twice I have almost suspected her of laughing at us This sobered Lizzie Straker What I should like to see her laugh at me I ve learnt jiu jitsu I d suppress her The question is is she to be trusted I m not so sure that our Horsham friend wasn t right Well don t tell her too much And test her Make her fire the next place Then she ll be compromised That s an idea She has always hung back and let us do the work They looked at each other across the table All right We had better go and scout by ourselves to morrow Galahad ought to be here by lunch time We can make our arrangements Leave after tea hide in the woods and do the job after dark Eve slept well in spite of all her problems She woke to the sound of a blackbird singing in the garden and the bird s song suited her waking mood being just the thing that Nature suggested She slipped out of bed drew back the chintz curtains and looked out on a dewy lawn all dappled with yellow sunlight The soul of the child and of the artist in her exulted She wanted to play with colours to express herself to make pictures Yes but she wanted more than that and she knelt down in her nightdress before the looking glass and leaning her elbows on the table stared into her own eyes She questioned herself Woman can you trust yourself It is a big thing such a big thing both for him and for you It was a sulky breakfast table that morning Lizzie Straker had the grumps and appeared to be on the watch for something that could be pounced on She was ready to provoke Eve into contradicting her but the real Eve the Eve that mattered was elsewhere She hardly heard what Lizzie Straker said We move on this evening Oh Does that interest you Not more than usual A telegram lay half hidden under Joan Gaunt s plate Lizzie and I are going off for a ramble The hint that Eve was not wanted was conveyed with frankness You had better stay in Dear comrade why Well you are known here That doesn t sound very logical Still I don t mind The dictator in Joan Gaunt was speaking but Eve was not irked by her tyranny on this particular morning She was ready to laugh gently to bear with these two women whose ignorance was so pathetic She would be content to spend the day alone sitting under one of the elms at the end of the bowling green and letting herself dream The consciousness that she was on the edge of a crisis did not worry her for somehow she believed that the problem was going to solve itself Joan Gaunt and Lizzie Straker started out from Basingford soon after nine and chartered a small boy who for the sum of a penny consented to act as guide to Fernhill But all this was mere strategy and when they had got rid of the boy they turned aside into the fir woods instead of presenting themselves at the office where would be visitors were supposed to interview one of the clerks Joan Gaunt had a rough map drawn on a piece of note paper a map that had been sent down from headquarters They explored the fir woods and the heath lands between Fernhill and Orchards Corner and after an hour s hunt they discovered what they had come in search of Canterton s new cottage standing with white plaster and black beams between the garden of rocks and the curtained gloom of the fir woods Joan Gaunt scribbled a few additional directions on the map They struck a rough sandy road that was used for carting timber and this woodland road joined the lane that ran past Orchards Corner It was just the place for Galahad s car to be hidden in while they made their night attack on the empty cottage In the meanwhile Eve was sitting under one of the elms at the end of the bowling green with a letter pad on her knees She had concluded that her comrades had designs upon Canterton s property that they meant to make a wreck of his glass houses and rare plants or to set fire to the sheds and offices and she had not the slightest intention of suffering any such thing to happen She was amused by the instant thoroughness of her own treachery Her impulses had deserted without hesitation to the opposite camp She wrote I am writing in case I should not see you to day My good comrades are Militants and your name is anathema I more than suspect that some part of your property will be attacked to night I send you a warning But I do not want these comrades of mine to suffer because I choose to play renegade Balk them and let them go I am thinking hard Eve She wrote Important and Private on the envelope and appealed to the proprietor of the Black Boar to provide her with a reliable messenger to carry her letter to Fernhill An old gentleman was taking a glass of beer in the bar and this same old gentleman lived as a pensioner in one of the Fernhill cottages He was sent out to see Eve who handed him a shilling and the letter I want Mr Canterton to get this before twelve o clock and I want you to make sure he has it I ll make sure o that miss I ain t likely to forget He toddled off and before twelve o clock Eve knew that her warning had carried for a boy on a bicycle brought her a note from Canterton Many thanks indeed I understand Let nothing prejudice you Joan Gaunt and Lizzie Straker returned about half past twelve and five minutes later a big grey motor pulled up outside the inn Mr Lawrence Kentucky climbed out and went in to order lunch From her room Eve had a view of the bowling green and of the doorway of a little summer house that stood under the row of elms She saw Lizzie Straker walk out into the garden and arrive casually at the door of the summer house Two minutes later Lawrence Kentucky wandered out with equal casualness appeared drawn by some invisible and circuitous thread to the summer house and vanished inside Eve smiled It was a comedy within a comedy but there was no cynical edge to her amusement She felt more kindly towards Lizzie Straker and perhaps Eve pitied her a little because she seemed so incapable of distinguishing between gold and brass Lawrence Kentucky did not stay more than five minutes in the summer house He had received his instructions and Joan Gaunt s map and a promise from Lizzie Straker that she would keep watch in the lane up by Orchards Corner so that he should not lose himself in the Fernhill woods Lawrence Kentucky went in to lunch and drove away soon afterwards in his big grey car She found that Lizzie Straker was in a bad temper when they sat down to lunch The t te t te in the summer house had been too impersonal to please her and Lawrence Kentucky had shown great tactlessness in asking questions about Eve Is Miss Carfax here Where did you pick her up Oh one of Pallas s kittens Jolly good looking girl Lizzie was feeling scratchy and she sparred with Eve You re a puzzler I don t believe you re a bit keen not what I call keen I can t sleep sometimes before doing something big I m quite keen enough I don t think you show it You ll have to buck up a bit won t she Joan We have to send in sealed reports you know Mrs Falconer expects to know the inside of everybody Perhaps she expects too much Anyhow it s her money we re spending Eve flushed I shall pay her back some day before very long You needn t think I called you a sponger I didn t Oh well would it have mattered They spent the afternoon in the garden and had tea under the may tree Joan Gaunt had asked for the bill and for three packets of sandwiches They paid the one and stowed the sandwiches away in their knapsacks and about five o clock they resumed their walking tour A march of two miles brought them into the thick of the fir woods and they had entered them by the timber track without meeting a soul Joan Gaunt chose a spot where a clump of young firs offered a secret camping ground for the lower boughs of the young trees being still green and bushy made a dense screen that hid them admirably Eve understood that a night attack was imminent and realised that no individual rambles would be authorised by Joan Gaunt She was to be penned in with these two fanatics for six long hours an undenounced traitor who had betrayed them into the enemy s hands Canterton would have men on guard and for the moment she was tempted to tell them the truth and so save them from being fooled But some subtle instinct held her back She felt herself to be part of the adventure that she would allow circumstances to lead circumstances that might prove of peculiar significance She was curious to see what would happen curious to see how the woman in her would react So Eve lay down among the young firs with her knapsack under her head and watched the sunlight playing in the boughs of the veterans overhead They made a net of sable and gold that stretched out over her a net that some god might let fall to tangle the lives of women and of men She felt the imminence of Nature felt herself part of the mysterious movement that could be sensed even in this solemn brooding wood Her two comrades lay on their fronts each with a chin thrust out over a book But Lizzie Straker soon grew restless She kept clicking her heels together and picking up dry fir cones and pulling them to pieces Eve watched her from behind half closed lids She felt sorry for Lizzie Straker because she guessed instinctively that Nature was playing her deep game even with this rebel sitting room n BrE The sitting room is clean Each villa has a separate sitting room ramble v
