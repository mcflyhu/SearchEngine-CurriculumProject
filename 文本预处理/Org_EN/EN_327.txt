Altogether then I was scarce so miserable the next days but what I had many hopeful and happy snatches threw myself with a good deal of constancy upon my studies and made out to endure the time till Alan should arrive or I might hear word of Catriona by the means of James More I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation One was to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in France from which place James shortly after started alone upon a private mission This was to England and to see Lord Holderness and it has always been a bitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same But he has need of a long spoon who sups with the deil or James More either During this absence the time was to fall due for another letter and as the letter was the condition of his stipend he had been so careful as prepare it beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be despatched The fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions and he was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal What I received began accordingly in the writing of James More [pg ] My dear Sir Your esteemed favour came to hand duly and I have to acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement It shall be all faithfully expended on my daughter who is well and desires to be remembered to her dear friend I find her in rather a melancholy disposition but trusts in the mercy of Grod to see her re established Our manner of life is very much alone but we solace ourselves with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains and by walking upon the margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland It was better days with me when I lay with five wounds upon my body on the field of Gladsmuir I have found employment here in the haras of a French nobleman where my experience is valued But my dear Sir the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be ashamed to mention them which makes your remittances the more necessary to my daughter s comfort though I daresay the sight of old friends would be still better My dear Sir Your affectionate obedient servant JAMES MACGREGOR DRUMMOND Below it began again in the hand of Catriona Do not be believing him it is all lies together C M D Not only did she add this postcript but I think she must have come near suppressing the letter for it came long after date and was closely followed by the third In the time betwixt them Alan had arrived and made another life to me with his merry conversation I had been presented to his cousin of the Scots Dutch a man that drank more than I could have thought possible and [pg ]was not otherwise of interest I had been entertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself all with no great change upon my sorrow and we two by which I mean Alan and myself and not at all the cousin had discussed a good deal the nature of my relations with James More and his daughter I was naturally diffident to give particulars and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the nature of Alan s commentary upon those I gave I cannae make head nor tail of it he would say but it sticks in my mind ye ve made a gowk of yourself There s few people that has had more experience than Alan Breck and I can never call to mind to have heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours The way that you tell it the thing s fair impossible Ye must have made a terrible hash of the business David There are whiles that I am of the same mind said I The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of a fancy for her too said Alan The biggest kind Alan said I and I think I ll take it to my grave with me Well ye beat me whatever he would conclude I showed him the letter with Catriona s postcript And here again he cried Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona and sense forby As for James More the man s as boss as a drum he s [pg ]just a wame and a wheen words though I ll can never deny that he fought reasonably well at Gladsmuir and it s true what he says here about the five wounds But the loss of him is that the man s boss Ye see Alan said I it goes against the grain with me to leave the maid in such poor hands Ye couldnae weel find poorer he admitted But what are ye to do with it It s this way about a man and a woman ye see Davie The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them Either they like the man and then a goes fine or else they just detest him and ye may spare your breath ye can do naething There s just the two sets of them them that would sell their coats for ye and them that never look the road ye re on That s a that there is to women and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither Well and I m afraid that s true for me said I And yet there s naething easier cried Alan I could easy learn ye the science of the thing but ye seem to me to be born blind and there s where the diffeeculty comes in And can you no help me I asked you that s so clever at the trade Ye see David I wasnae here said he I m like a field officer that has naebody but blind men for scouts and claireurs and what would he ken But it sticks in my mind that ye ll have made some kind [pg ]of bauchle and if I was you I would have a try at her again Would ye so man Alan said I I would e en t says he The third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such talk and it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion James professed to be in some concern upon his daughter s health which I believe was never better abounded in kind expressions to myself and finally proposed that I should visit them at Dunkirk You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr Stewart he wrote Why not accompany him so far in his return to France I have something very particular for Mr Stewart s ear and at any rate I would be pleased to meet in with an old fellow soldier and one so mettle as himself As for you my dear sir my daughter and I would be proud to receive our benefactor whom we regard as a brother and a son The French nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of character and I have been necessitate to leave the haras You will find us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the auberge of a man Bazin on the dunes but the situation is caller and I make no doubt but we might spend some very pleasant days when Mr Stewart and I could recall our services and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a manner more befitting your age I beg at [pg ]least that Mr Stewart would come here my business with him opens a very wide door What does the man want with me cried Alan when he had read What he wants with you is clear enough it s siller But what can he want with Alan Breck O it ll be just an excuse said I He is still after this marriage which I wish from my heart that we could bring about And he asks you because he thinks I would be less likely to come wanting you Well I wish that I kent says Alan Him and me were never onyways pack we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers Something for my ear quo he I ll maybe have something for his hinder end before we re through with it Dod I m thinking it would be a kind of a divertisement to gang and see what he ll be after Forby that I could see your lassie then What say ye Davie Will ye ride with Alan You may be sure I was not backward and Alan s furlough running towards an end we set forth presently upon this joint adventure It was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the town of Dunkirk We left our horses at the post and found a guide to Bazin s Inn which lay beyond the walls Night was quite fallen so that we were the last to leave that fortress and heard the doors of it close behind us as we passed the bridge On the other side there lay a lighted suburb which we [pg ]thridded for a while then turned into a dark lane and presently found ourselves wading in the night among deep sand where we could hear a bullering of the sea We travelled in this fashion for some while following our conductor mostly by the sound of his voice and I had begun to think he was perhaps misleading us when we came to the top of a small brae and there appeared out of the darkness a dim light in a window Voil l auberge Bazin says the guide Alan smacked his lips An unco lonely bit said he and I thought by his tone he was not wholly pleased A little after and we stood in the lower storey of the house which was all in the one apartment with a stair leading to the chambers at the side benches and tables by the wall the cooking fire at the one end of it and shelves of bottles and the cellar trap at the other Here Bazin who was an ill looking big man told us the Scottish gentleman was gone abroad he knew not where but the young lady was above and he would call her down to us I took from my breast the kerchief wanting the corner and knotted it about my throat I could hear my heart go and Alan patting me on the shoulder with some of his laughable expressions I could scarce refrain from a sharp word But the time was not long to wait I heard her step pass overhead and saw her on the stair This she descended very quietly and [pg ]greeted me with a pale face and certain seeming of earnestness or uneasiness in her manner that extremely dashed me My father James More will be here soon He will be very pleased to see you she said And then of a sudden her face flamed her eyes lightened the speech stopped upon her lips and I made sure she had observed the kerchief It was only for a breath that she was discomposed but methought it was with a new animation that she turned to welcome Alan And you will be his friend Alan Breck she cried Many is the dozen times I will have heard him tell of you and I love you already for all your bravery and goodness Well well says Alan holding her hand in his and viewing her and so this is the young lady at the last of it David you re an awful poor hand of a description I do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people s hearts the sound of his voice was like song What will he have been describing me she cried Little else of it since I ever came out of France says he forby a bit of speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood by Silvermills But cheer up my dear ye re bonnier than what he said And now there s one thing sure you and me are to be a pair of friends I m a kind of a henchman to Davie here I m like a tyke at his heels and whatever he cares for I ve [pg ]got to care for too and by the holy airn they ve got to care for me So now you can see what way you stand with Alan Breck and ye ll find ye ll hardly lose on the transaction He s no very bonnie my dear but he s leal to them he loves I thank you with my heart for your good words said she I have that honour for a brave honest man that I cannot find any to be answering with Using travellers freedom we spared to wait for James More and sat down to meat we threesome Alan had Catriona sit by him and wait upon his wants he made her drink first out of his glass he surrounded her with continual kind gallantries and yet never gave me the most small occasion to be jealous and he kept the talk so much in his own hand and that in so merry a note that neither she nor I remembered to be embarrassed If any one had seen us there it must have been supposed that Alan was the old friend and I the stranger Indeed I had often cause to love and to admire the man but I never loved or admired him better than that night and I could not help remarking to myself what I was sometimes rather in danger of forgetting that he had not only much experience of life but in his own way a great deal of natural ability besides As for Catriona she seemed quite carried away her laugh was like a peal of bells her face gay as a May morning and I own although I was very well pleased yet I was a little sad also and thought myself a dull stockish character [pg ]in comparison of my friend and very unfit to come into a young maid s life and perhaps ding down her gaiety But if that was like to be my part I found at least that I was not alone in it for James More returning suddenly the girl was changed into a piece of stone Through the rest of that evening until she made an excuse and slipped to bed I kept an eye upon her without cease and I can bear testimony that she never smiled scarce spoke and looked mostly on the board in front of her So that I really marvelled to see so much devotion as it used to be changed into the very sickness of hate Of James More it is unnecessary to say much you know the man already what there was to know of him and I am weary of writing out his lies Enough that he drank a great deal and told us very little that was to any possible purpose As for the business with Alan that was to be reserved for the morrow and his private hearing It was the more easy to be put off because Alan and I were pretty weary with our day s ride and sat not very late after Catriona We were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make shift with a single bed Alan looked on me with a queer smile Ye muckle ass said he What do ye mean by that I cried [pg ] Mean What do I mean It s extraordinar David man says he that you should be so mortal stupit Again I begged him to speak out Well it s this of it said he I told ye there were the two kinds of women them that would sell their shifts for ye and the others Just you try for yoursel my bonny man I But what s that neepkin at your
