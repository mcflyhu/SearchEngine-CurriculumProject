It went very quickly now with the drying fevers that made her cheeks red her nostrils pinched or with the exhaustion of baths of perspiration her pulse hardly beating And Ramuntcho had no other thought than his mother the image of Gracieuse ceased to visit him during these funereal days She was going Franchita she was going mute and as if indifferent asking for nothing never complaining Once however as he was watching she called him suddenly with a poor voice of anguish to throw her arms around him to draw him to her lean her head on his cheek And in that minute Ramuntcho saw pass in her eyes the great Terror that of the flesh which feels that it is finishing that of the men and that of the beasts the horrible and the same for all A believer she was that a little practising rather like so many other women around her timid in the face of dogmas of observances of services but without a clear conception of the world beyond without a luminous hope Heaven all the beautiful things promised after life Yes perhaps But still the black hole was there near and certain where she would have to turn into dust What was sure what was inexorable was the fact that never never more would her destroyed visage lean in a real manner on that of Ramuntcho then in the doubt of having a mind which would fly in the horror and the misery of annihilation of becoming powder and nothing she wanted again kisses from that son and she clutched at him as clutch the wrecked who fall into the black and deep waters He understood all this which the poor fading eyes said so well And the pity so tender which he had already felt at seeing the wrinkles and the white hairs of his mother overflowed like a flood from his very young heart he responded to this appeal with all that one may give of desolate clasps and embraces But it did not last long She had never been one of those who are enervated for long or at least let it appear Her arms unclasped her head fallen back she closed her eyes again unconscious now or stoical And Ramuntcho standing not daring to touch her wept heavy tears without noise turning his head while in the distance the parish bell began to ring the curfew sang the tranquil peace of the village filled the air with vibrations soft protective advising sound sleep to those who have morrows The following morning after having confessed she passed out of life silent and haughty having felt a sort of shame for her suffering while the same bell rang slowly her agony And at night Ramuntcho found himself alone beside that thing in bed and cold which is preserved and looked at for several hours but which one must make haste to bury in the earth nostrils nostril Her nostrils flared with anger The horse dilated its nostrils exhaustion n She slept the sleep of exhaustion His exhaustion was obvious when he fell asleep standing perspiration n It is so hot that my clothes are wet with perspiration The perspiration was running down my back funereal adj He addressed the group in funereal tones The mood of the music was almost funereal anguish n She cried out for anguish at parting The unspeakable anguish wrung his heart luminous adj There are luminous knobs on all the doors in my house Most clocks and watches in this shop are in luminous paint misery n Business depression usually causes misery among the working class He has rescued me from the mire of misery wrecked adj the hulk of a wrecked ship the salvage of the wrecked tanker overflowed Plates overflowed with party food A great throng packed out the theater and overflowed into the corridors desolate adj v The city was burned into a desolate waste We all felt absolutely desolate when she left enervated adj v enervate She was enervated from dissipation The long march in the sun enervated the soldiers standing n adj After the earthquake only a few houses were left standing They re standing out against any change in the law tranquil adj The boy disturbed the tranquil surface of the pond with a stick The tranquil beauty of the village scenery is unique vibrations n vibration We could feel the vibrations from the trucks passing outside I am drawn to that girl I get good vibrations from her haughty adj He gave me a haughty look and walked away They were displeased with her haughty airs
