Now they open to the beautiful April morning the shutters of their narrow windows pierced like portholes in the thickness of the very old wall And suddenly it is a flood of light that dazzles their eyes Outside the spring is resplendent Never had they seen before this summits so high and so near But along the slopes full of leaves along the mountains decked with trees the sun descends to radiate in this valley on the whiteness of the village on the kalsomine of the ancient houses with green shutters Both awakened with veins full of youth and hearts full of joy They have formed the project this morning to go into the country to the house of Madame Dargaignaratz s cousins and see the two little girls who must have arrived the night before in the carriage Gracieuse and Pantchika After a glance at the ball game square where they shall return to practice in the afternoon they go on their way through small paths magnificently green hidden in the depths of the valleys skirting the cool torrents The foxglove flowers start everywhere like long pink rockets above the light and infinite mass of ferns It is at a long distance it seems that house of the Olhagarray cousins and they stop from time to time to ask the way from shepherds or they knock at the doors of solitary houses here and there under the cover of branches They had never seen Basque houses so old nor so primitive under the shade of chestnut trees so tall The ravines through which they advance are strangely enclosed Higher than all these woods of oaks and of beeches which seem as if suspended above appear ferocious denuded summits a zone abrupt and bald sombre brown making points in the violent blue of the sky But here underneath is the sheltered and mossy region green and deep which the sun never burns and where April has hidden its luxury freshly superb And they also the two who are passing through these paths of foxglove and of fern participate in this splendor of spring Little by little in their enjoyment at being there and under the influence of this ageless place the old instincts to hunt and to destroy are lighted in the depths of their minds Arrochkoa excited leaps from right to left from left to right breaks uproots grasses and flowers troubles about everything that moves in the green foliage about the lizards that might be caught about the birds that might be taken out of their nests and about the beautiful trout swimming in the water he jumps he leaps he wishes he had fishing lines sticks guns truly he reveals his savagery in the bloom of his robust eighteen years Ramuntcho calms himself quickly after breaking a few branches plucking a few flowers he begins to meditate and he thinks Here they are stopped now at a cross road where no human habitation is visible Around them are gorges full of shade wherein grand oaks grow thickly and above everywhere a piling up of mountains of a reddish color burned by the sun There is nowhere an indication of the new times there is an absolute silence something like the peace of the primitive epochs Lifting their heads toward the brown peaks they perceive at a long distance persons walking on invisible paths pushing before them donkeys of smugglers as small as insects at such a distance are these silent passers by on the flank of the gigantic mountain Basques of other times almost confused as one looks at them from this place with this reddish earth from which they came and where they are to return after having lived like their ancestors without a suspicion of the things of our times of the events of other places They take off their caps Arrochkoa and Ramuntcho to wipe their foreheads it is so warm in these gorges and they have run so much jumped so much that their entire bodies are in a perspiration They are enjoying themselves but they would like to come nevertheless near the two little blonde girls who are waiting for them But of whom shall they ask their way now since there is no one Ave Maria cries at them from the thickness of the branches an old rough voice And the salutation is prolonged by a string of words spoken in a rapid decrescendo quick quick a Basque prayer rattled breathlessly begun very loudly then dying at the finish And an old beggar comes out of the fern all earthy all hairy all gray bent on his stick like a man of the woods Yes says Arrochkoa putting his hand in his pocket but you must take us to the Olhagarray house The Olhagarray house replies the old man I have come from it my children and you are near it In truth how had they failed to see at a hundred steps further that black gable among branches of chestnut trees At a point where sluices rustle it is bathed by a torrent that Olhagarray house antique and large among antique chestnut trees Around the red soil is denuded and furrowed by the waters of the mountain enormous roots are interlaced in it like monstrous gray serpents and the entire place overhung on all sides by the Pyrenean masses is rude and tragic But two young girls are there seated in the shade with blonde hair and elegant little pink waists astonishing little fairies very modern in the midst of the ferocious and old scenes They rise with cries of joy to meet the visitors It would have been better evidently to enter the house and salute the old people But the boys say to themselves that they have not been seen coming and they prefer to sit near their sweethearts by the side of the brook on the gigantic roots And as if by chance the two couples manage not to bother one another to remain hidden from one another by rocks by branches There then they talk at length in a low voice Arrochkoa with Pantchika Ramuntcho with Gracieuse What can they be saying talking so much and so quickly Although their accent is less chanted than that of the highland which astonished them yesterday one would think they were speaking scanned stanzas in a sort of music infinitely soft where the voices of the boys seem voices of children What are they saying to one another talking so much and so quickly beside this torrent in this harsh ravine under the heavy sun of noon What they are saying has not much sense it is a sort of murmur special to lovers something like the special song of the swallows at nesting time It is childish a tissue of incoherences and repetitions No what they are saying has not much sense unless it be what is most sublime in the world the most profound and truest things which may be expressed by terrestrial words It means nothing unless it be the eternal and marvellous hymn for which alone has been created the language of men and beasts and in comparison with which all is empty miserable and vain The heat is stifling in the depth of that gorge so shut in from all sides in spite of the shade of the chestnut trees the rays that the leaves sift burn still And this bare earth of a reddish color the extreme oldness of this nearby house the antiquity of these trees give to the surroundings while the lovers talk aspects somewhat harsh and hostile Ramuntcho has never seen his little friend made so pink by the sun on her cheeks there is the beautiful red blood which flushes the skin the fine and transparent skin she is pink as the foxglove flowers Flies mosquitoes buzz in their ears Now Gracieuse has been bitten on the chin almost on the mouth and she tries to touch it with the end of her tongue to bite the place with the upper teeth And Ramuntcho who looks at this too closely feels suddenly a langour to divert himself from which he stretches himself like one trying to awake She begins again the little girl her lip still itching and he again stretches his arms throwing his chest backward What is the matter Ramuntcho and why do you stretch yourself like a cat But when for the third time Gracieuse bites the same place and shows again the little tip of her tongue he bends over vanquished by the irresistible giddiness and bites also takes in his mouth like a beautiful red fruit which one fears to crush the fresh lip which the mosquito has bitten A silence of fright and of delight during which both shiver she as much as he she trembling also in all her limbs for having felt the contact of the growing black mustache You are not angry tell me No my Ramuntcho Oh I am not angry no Then he begins again quite frantic and in this languid and warm air they exchange for the first time in their lives the long kisses of lovers shutters shutter The shop front is fitted with rolling shutters The shutters thumped the wall in the wind descends v descend This festival descends from a
