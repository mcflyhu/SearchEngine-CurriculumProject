Three women with dusty shoes and brown faces came along under the Downs to Bignor village They wore rough brown skirts white blouses and straw hats and each carried a knapsack strapped over her shoulder Now Bignor is particularly and remotely beautiful especially when you have left the flat country behind you and climbed up to the church by the winding lanes It is pure country almost uninvaded by modernity and so old in the midst of its perennial youth that you might hardly wonder at meeting a Roman cohort on the march or a bevy of bronze haired British girls laughing and singing between the hedgerows The village shop with its timber and thatch might be a wood cut from a romance The Downs rise up against the blue and their solemn green slopes over which the Roman highway climbs seem to accentuate the sense of silence and of mystery Great beech woods shut in steep secret meadows There are lush valleys where the grass grows tall and flowers dream in the sunlight The three women came to Bignor church and camped out in the churchyard to make their midday meal Eve Carfax was one of them brown bright eyed with a red mouth that smiled mysteriously at beauty Next to her sat Joan Gaunt lean strenuous with Roman nose and abrupt sharp edged mouth Her wrists and hands were big boned and thin The line of her blouse and skirt showed hardly a curve She wore square toed Oxford shoes and very thick brown stockings Lizzie Straker sat a little apart restless even in repose a pinched frown set permanently between her eyebrows her assertive chin uptilted She was the eloquent splutterer a slim mercurial woman with prominent blue eyes and a lax mouth who protruded her lips when she spoke and whose voice was a challenge Eve had wanted to turn aside to see the remains of the Roman villa but her companions had dropped scorn on the suggestion Wasting time on a few old bits of tesselated pavement What have we got to do with the Romans It s the present that matters Eve had suggested that one might learn something even from the Romans and the glitter of fun in her eyes had set Lizzie Straker declaiming What tosh And you call yourself an artist and yet admire the Romans Don t you know that artists were slaves at Rome Don t ask me to consider any society that subsisted on slavery It s dead doesn t come into one s line of vision I call arch ology the most abominable dilettante rot that was ever invented to make some old gentlemen bigger bores than their neighbours And so she had spluttered on all the way to Bignor church working her voluble mouth and punching the air with a small brown fist The eloquence was still in her when she opened her packet of sandwiches and her energy divided itself between declamation and disposing of mouthfuls of bread and ham Eve sat looking countrywards thinking Oh do be quiet She wanted to lose herself in the beauty of the landscape and she was in a mood to be delighted by a fern growing in a wall or by the way the fresh green of a tree caught the sunlight For the moment her spirit escaped and climbed up among the branches of an old yew and fluttered there in the sparkling gloom while Lizzie Straker kept up her caterwauling below They had been on the open road for a fortnight and Lizzie Straker still had the autumn tints of a black eye that an apple thrown in a Sussex village had given her They had been hustled and chased on two occasions Joan Gaunt coming in for most of the eggs and flour perhaps because of her fierce leathery face and her defiant manner Eve had recollections of cleaning herself in a station waiting room while a sergeant and two constables guarded the door And strange to say some of her sympathies had been with the crowd These three women had tramped and suffered together yet each day only emphasised Eve s discovery that she was failing to tone with her companions They had begun by boring her and they were beginning to exasperate her rousing a spirit of antagonism that was ready to criticise them without mercy Never in her life had Eve been in the presence of two such masses of ferocious prejudice Their attitude towards the country was in complete contrast to hers They were two blind fanatics on a pilgrimage while Eve was a wayfarer whose eyes and ears and nostrils were open to Nature Joan Gaunt and Lizzie Straker lived for words bundles of phrases arguments assertions accusations They were two polemical pamphlets on legs sent out walking over God s green earth Eve noticed that their senses were less alive than hers and that they were absurdly unobservant Perhaps they had passed a cottage garden full of wallflowers blood red and gold and Eve had asked Did you smell them Smell what The flowers What flowers The wallflowers in that garden They had neither seen nor smelt anything and they had looked at her as though she were a sentimental trifler On another occasion an orchard in bloom filling a green hollow between two woods had made Eve stand gazing Isn t that perfect Lizzie Straker saw nothing but what her mad prejudices were allowing her to see I should like to come along with an axe and chop down all those trees It would make quite a good protest Eve had felt satirical Why shouldn t we blow up Chanctonbury Ring And they had taken her seriously We should want such a lot of dynamite But it s an idea quite an idea At the small town of Battle they had thirsted to blow up the great abbey gateway while Eve was letting her eyes take in all the grey beauty of the stonework warmed by the evening sunlight These two women had a mad against property Protest by violence was becoming an obsession with them They were like hostile troops marching through a rich and hated land Now from the very first day in the country a change had come over Eve A crust of hardness seemed to have fallen from her and once more she had felt herself to be the possessor of an impressionable and glowing body whose skin and senses responded to the sunlight the winds the colours and the scent of the earth She no longer felt like a little pricking thorn in the big body of life She belonged to the earth She was in the apple blossom and in the red flare of a bed of tulips Self was no longer dissevered from the all consciousness of the life round her The tenderness came back to her all those mysterious elusive and exultant moods that came she knew not whence and went she knew not whither She had ceased to be a pathological specimen corked up in a bottle and had become part of the colour and the smell the joy and the pathos of things vital In the fields Eve saw lambs at play skipping absurdly butting each other Birds were singing and making love and the bees were busy in the furze A sense of the immensity of the exultant rush of life possessed her And this pilgrimage of theirs all this spouting and declaiming this lean necked heroism seemed futile and rather ridiculous Was one to tell Nature that she must stand aside and order youth not to look into the eyes of youth It might serve for the few They were like children making castles and dykes and rivulets on the sands within the reach of the sea Eve imagined that Nature must be amused but that she would wipe out these eccentricities so soon as they began to bore her She felt herself in the midst of elemental things whereas Joan Gaunt had studied botany in a museum That afternoon they marched on to Pulborough and entering an inn announced to the landlord that they intended staying for the night Joan Gaunt managed the practical side of the pilgrimage She entered the inn with the air of an officer commanding food and beds in time of war Three bedrooms and a cold supper at nine The landlord was a Sussex man short stolid and laconic He looked at Joan Gaunt out of staring blue eyes and asked whether their luggage had been left at the station We have not got any luggage We are on a walking tour You can give us our tea in the garden Joan Gaunt did not hear what the landlord said to his wife who was cleaning table silver in a pantry at the end of a long passage It was terse and unflattering and included such phrases as Three tooth brushes and a change of stockings A scrag of mutton without so much as a frill to the bone end The three comrades had tea in the garden and were studied suspiciously by the landlord s wife a comely little woman with bright brown eyes The few words that she uttered were addressed to Eve A nice May we re having Splendid And then Joan Gaunt proceeded to make an implacable enemy of her by telling her to see that the beds were properly aired About seven o clock Pulborough discovered that it had been invaded by suffragettes Three women had stationed themselves with their backs to a wall at a place where three roads met and one of the women it was Lizzie Straker brandished a small flag Pulborough gathered The news spread somehow even to the outlying cottages Stale eggs are to be found even in the country and a certain number of stale eggs rushed to attend the meeting Lizzie Straker was the speaker and the people of Pulborough appeared to discover something intensely funny in Lizzie Straker Her enthusiastic and earnest spluttering tickled them The more she frowned and punched the air with that brown fist of hers the more amusing they found her The Executive had not been wise in its choice of an itinerant orator for Lizzie Straker lost her temper very quickly on such occasions and growing venomous began to say scathing things things that even a Sussex brain can understand Some of the younger spirits began to jeer Do you wonder she be unt married Can t she talk Like a kettle a boiling over What s she wanting a vote for I ll tell you for why to have laws made so as all the pretty girls shall be sent off to Canada Their humour was hardly less crude than Lizzie Straker s sneering superiority And then an egg flew and broke against the wall behind Joan Gaunt s head The crowd closed in threateningly The flag was snatched from Lizzie Straker and someone threw a dead mouse in Joan Gaunt s face The retreat to the inn was not dignified The rest of the eggs followed them but for some reason or other Eve was spared Her two comrades came in for all the honour The crowd accompanied them to the inn and found the blue eyed landlord standing in the doorway Chuck em out Mister Crowhurst We don t want the likes of them in Pulborough Joan Gaunt was for pushing her way in and the landlord gave way He said a few words to the crowd shut the door and followed the suffragettes into the long passage Sorry ladies but you ll have to turn out I can t keep you It isn t safe Lizzie Straker s claws were still out But you have got to You keep a public house It s the law A voice chimed in from the end of the passage John I won t have those women in my house No I won t that s a fact They ve got neither sense nor manners All right my dear If I had my way I d have them all put in asylums Disgusting fools I don t care let them summon us I won t have them in my house Joan Gaunt tried her Roman manner I shall insist on staying Where are the police That s right call for the men Where are the police The landlord grinned Can t say I ll take you out the back way and through the orchard into the fields It s getting dark But we are not going I shall let the crowd in ladies in three minutes That s all I have got to say Eve ran upstairs and brought down the three knapsacks Let s go she said we re causing a lot of bother That s the only sensible one of the lot said the voice and what s more she s worth looking at The crowd was growing restive and noisy There was the sound of breaking glass The landlord jerked a thumb in the direction of the front door There you are they re getting nasty You come along with me They went under protest with the exception of Eve who paused at the end of the passage and spoke to the little woman with the brown eyes I m sorry I ll send some money for the glass And what do we owe for the tea Three shillings miss Thank you And what do you do it for Eve laughed Oh well you see I wouldn t go along with those scrags if I were you It s silly The little woman had pluck for she went out to cajole the crowd and kept it in play while her husband smuggled the suffragettes through the garden and orchard and away across the fields They escaped unmolested and the dusk covered their retreat After the landlord had left them they walked about three miles and lost themselves completely and thoroughly in a net work of by roads Shelter for the night became a consideration and it was Eve who sighted a haystack in the corner of a field and who suggested it as a refuge They scrambled over a gate and found that the haystack had been cut into and that there was a deep fragrant walled recess sheltered from the road Lizzie Straker began to pull down some loose hay and spread it to make a cushion We must teach those savages a lesson We ought to set fire to this in the early morning Eve was tired of Lizzie Straker I don t think that would be sport burning the thing that has sheltered you The hay was fragrant but it could not mask the odour that had attached itself to her companions clothes Eve had been spared the rotten eggs but she was made to suffer indirectly and persuaded to edge away into the corner of the recess They had had to fly without their supper and a few dry rock cakes and some biscuits were all that they had in their knapsacks Lizzie Straker produced a candle end and a box of matches It was a windless night and by the light of the candle the two women examined each other s scars We might get some of it off with the hay Isn t it disgusting And no water to wash in They proceeded to rub each other down taking turns in holding the candle Eve had a suggestion to make You will have to get some new blouses at the next town I shall have to go in and shop for you They glanced at her critically realising for the first time that she had escaped without any of the marks of martyrdom Didn t you get any No you seem to have been the favourites Disgusting savages The Sussex people always were the worst boors in England When they had made some sort of job of their mutual grooming and had eaten a few rock cakes and biscuits Joan Gaunt unbuttoned her blouse and drew from the inner depths a long white envelope Lizzie Straker sidled nearer still holding the candle Eve had not seen this envelope before She stood up and looked down over their shoulders as they sat Joan Gaunt had drawn out a sheet of foolscap that was covered with cipher Lizzie Straker pointed an eager finger That s the place It s between Horsham and Guildford And there s no proper caretaker only a man at the lodge We can make a blaze of it We shall hear from Galahad at Horsham They were human enough to feel a retaliating vindictiveness after the way they had been pelted at Pulborough and Eve looking down at the paper that Joan Gaunt held realised at last that they were incendiaries as well as preachers She could not read the precious document but she guessed what it contained Is that our Black List Yes They did not offer to explain the cipher to her for she was still something of a probationer Moreover the candle was guttering out and Lizzie Straker had to smother it in the grass beside the stack Eve returned to her corner made a nest took off her hat and turning her knapsack into a pillow lay down to look at the stars A long day in the open had made her sleepy but Joan Gaunt and Lizzie Straker were still talking Eve fell asleep with
