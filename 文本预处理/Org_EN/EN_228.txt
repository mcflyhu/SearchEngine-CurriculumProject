The day after the Harland inquest I meant to go down and see Iola and find out if she d heard anything from Miss Whitehall But that day I got sidetracked some way or other and the next it rained Usually I don t mind rain but this was the real wet straight kind that would get in at you if you wore a diver s suit As I stood at the parlor window looking down at the street all pools and puddles with the walls shining under a thin glaze of water and the umbrellas like wet black mushrooms I got faint hearted I could just as well phone and if anything had transpired it was the business I was uneasy about go down and help Iola through the fit of blind staggers she d be bound to have So presently it was Hello Iola I was coming down today but it s too moistuous Then Iola s voice sort of groaning Oh Molly is that you I do wish it had been fine and you d have come Why anything wrong Oh yes everything Miss Whitehall isn t back yet and Mr Ford s hardly been in at all and has such a gloom on him you wouldn t know him and I m awful discouraged Have you tried to see Miss Whitehall No I can t seem to get up enough spunk Why don t you phone her Well I don t know I m sort of scared of what I ll hear I thought I d better sit around and wait and then I thought I ought to find out and between the two Oh dear what s the use That was just like Iola The only way you can be sure she s got a mind at all is the trouble she has making it up If it s true that men like the helpless kind she ought to have a string of lovers as long as the line at the box office when Caruso sings Pagliacci I wonder I ever got married Tell you what girlie I said you come up tonight and dine with me Himself is going to be late and we two bandits will steal out after dinner and make a raid on Miss Whitehall s Even then she hung back I had to coax and urge and it was only me promising I d see her through and if necessary ask the questions made her finally agree The rain held on all day and it was teeming when we started out Miss Whitehall s flat was on the other side of town the East Sixties and we had to go round the Park crowding on and off cars fighting our way through packs of people Iola clawing at my back and catching her umbrella in men s hats and women s hair till you d think she did it on purpose When we got to the street we turned east walking from Madison Avenue over Park with its great huge apartment houses and then on a ways not far but far enough to make you feel Miss Whitehall s home wasn t as stylishly located as her office Iola was that nervous I was afraid she d forget the number but we found it on a corner over a drug store where there were large glassy bottles in the window and advertisements of ladies offering pills and candy with such glad inviting smiles you d know it was damaged stock The entrance was round on the side and as we stood in the vestibule dimly lit with a line of letter boxes on each side I couldn t help but whisper You d never think from her offices she d live over a store And Iola answered pushing the button under a letter box marked Mrs Serena Whitehall It s a shock to me I d no more connect her with a push button than I would you with a glass topped entrance and a man in knee pants The door clicked and we went up the stairs one feeble little electric bulb furnishing the light There was a smell in the air like one of the tenants had had lamb stew for dinner and another was smoking the kind of cigar that tells you it s strong and hearty half a block off The first floor landing was hers a card in a frame by the door told us so and we pressed on the bell hearing it give a loud whirring ring inside The door was opened by a young girl very neat in a black dress and white apron She was sure we couldn t speak to Miss Whitehall but perhaps Mrs Whitehall would see us and she showed us up the tiny little hall into the dining room I d never have believed a room furnished so plain could be so elegant There was a square of brown carpet on the floor and ecru linen curtains no lace just hemstitched at the windows and on the side table some silver yet it had a refined classy look Two doors opened from it one into the hall hung with a blue porti re and double ones that I guessed led into the parlor We could hear voices coming from there low and murmuring By this time Iola was that nervous she was licking her lips with her tongue like a baby that s had a sugar stick I was just edging round to give her a dig and whisper Brace up when the curtain into the hall was lifted and a lady came in As she was well along in years near to fifty I d say I knew she was Mrs Whitehall She was very dignified and gentle with black hair turning gray and lots of lines on her forehead and round her eyes which were dark like her hair and had a sad weary expression I guessed she d been handsome once but she looked as if she d had her troubles and when I heard her voice low and so quiet there was something in it that made me feel she was having them still I d promised to be spokesman and not seeing any reason to waste time I went straight to the point Mrs Whitehall stood listening her hands clasped on the back of a chair her eyes on the little fern plant in the center of the table Perhaps it would be best she said in that soft faded sort of voice if Miss Barry were to see my daughter I hardly know what to say to her She turned and left the room by the hall door and Iola gasped at me Oh Molly it s true Don t cross your bridges till you come to them I said but all the same I thought it looked bad What ll I do if the business shuts down Shut up till you know if it does I whispered back The double doors rolled back and Mrs Whitehall stood between them She looked at Iola If you ll come in here Miss Barry she said my daughter will see you It was plain she didn t expect me so I stood by the table without moving As Mrs Whitehall drew back and before Iola got to the doorway there was a moment when I saw into the room It looked real artistic flowered cretonne curtains wicker chairs with cushions and low bookcases around the walls the whole lit up by the yellow glow of lamps But I wasn t interested in the furniture what caught my eye was a couch just opposite the open door on which a woman was lying There was a lamp on a stand beside her and its light fell full over her If I hadn t known Carol Whitehall was there I d have guessed right off it was she from the likeness to her mother She had just the same hair and deep rich looking eyes except in her the hair was black as night and the eyes were young She had a newspaper in her hand and as the doors opened she d looked up intent and questioning and I saw she was beautiful She was like a picture leaning forward with that inquiring expression her features clear in the flood of soft light I got an impression of her then that I ve never forgotten of force and strength It didn t come from anything especial in her face but from something in her general makeup something vivid and warm like she was alive straight through They stayed in the room some time while I sat waiting I d sized up everything in sight especially two little glass lamps on the sideboard that I thought would be a nice present for Babbitts to give me on my next birthday when the doors slid back and Iola came in She didn t say anything and seemed in a hurry to be off Mrs Whitehall showed us out very polite but depressed and when the door was shut on us and we stole down the stairs I felt the worst had come In the vestibule I looked at Iola and said Well She was struggling with her umbrella her face bent over it Fired she answered in a husky voice The rain was coming down in torrents and wanting to cuddle up comforting against her I didn t raise my umbrella and we walked up the street squeezed together with the downpour spattering around us Believe me the water fell under Iola s umbrella pretty nearly as heavy as it did outside it Miss Whitehall was broke Mr Harland had been her financial backer and now she was ruined and the business would close The surprise and horror of the whole thing had prostrated her and as soon as she was better she d wind up the Azalea Woods Estates and try and sublet her offices on which she had still a six months lease She was awful sweet Iola sobbed She gave me a full month s salary and said she d meant to keep me forever Oh Molly why did it have to happen I squeezed her and said That s all right dearie We ll all hustle and get you another job I got lots of money and what s mine s yours the way it always is between good and true friends But Iola wouldn t be comforted I can t take your money I never took a cent yet And I thought I was fixed for life I thought even if the business didn t pan out big she d marry Mr Barker and get a place for me Marry Mr Barker I cried out astonished Yes that s what I thought was coming Believe me I was surprised She d never dropped a hint of it Why didn t you tell me that before I asked Because Tony Ford told me not to He said I wasn t to tell anybody that Barker being such a big bug it would get in the papers and that might break it all up But are you sure Did he act like he was in love with her We were passing one of those arc lights on Park Avenue and the scornful look she cast at me tears and all was plain Wouldn t you think a man was in love even if he was a magnate who d buy a house and lot just for an excuse to see a lady Did you ever hear him making love to her No but I didn t need to I ve been made love to enough myself to know the signs without hearing First it was all business and I believed it was only that Then one day when Mr Ford was out he came in and lingered round making conversation You know the way they do it and for all he was a magnate Mr Barker was just the same as the errand boy That s the way it is with men they got no variety He wanted to know about her home and the farm and before that Oh Indiana a fine state Indiana It made me laugh to see him with his hook nose and gray hair handing out the same line of talk that Billy Dunn gave me when I was in the linen envelope place Did she seem to care for him Not at first She was very formal just a bow and then right off about the bungalow But he had the symptoms from the start looking at her like he couldn t take his eyes off and not caring whether the bungalow was as small as a hencoop or as big as the Waldorf They went along that way for a while then something happened a fight I guess when Tony Ford and I weren t there Anyhow after it she was so cold and distant you d wonder he had the nerve to come Then one afternoon he came in and asked her low I heard him if he could have a few words with her in the private office She hesitated but I guess she couldn t see her way to refusing so in they went and had a long powwow Whatever it was they said to each other it smoothed out all the wrinkles After that she was as different to him as summer is to winter In my own mind I thought they were engaged for she d brighten up when he came in and smile I never saw her smile like that at anyone and once when they thought I couldn t hear I heard him call her dear They d go into the private office and talk Gee how they talked And always low like they were afraid Tony Ford and I might overhear And on the top of all that he disappears Perhaps that s why she s been sick Sure it is It s bad enough to lose your own money but wouldn t it make you sick to lose millions let alone the man you re in love with even if he has a nose you could hang an umbrella on Poor thing I said for I could see now what the lady lying on the couch had been up against We re all poor things said Iola beginning to get sorry for herself again Miss Whitehall and the man that s dead and Tony Ford who s lost his job and me poor unfortunate me that I thought was on velvet for the rest of my days Babbitts didn t get home till late that night but I was so full of what Iola had said that I waited up for him When he did come he hadn t but one kiss when I pulled away from him and told him Doesn t it seem to you Soapy I said that that story ought to go back to Mr Whitney He looked at me sideways with a sly questioning glance Why he asked Why if Barker s in love with her don t you think maybe he ll try and creep back or get in touch with her some way He burst out laughing Oh Morningdew there s a lot of nice things about you but one of the nicest is that you never disappoint a fellow I was wondering if you d see it Go back to Mr Whitney It ll go back the first thing
