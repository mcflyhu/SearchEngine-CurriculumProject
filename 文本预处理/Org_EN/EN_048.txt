Before leaving her newly discovered aunt Audrey extracted permission from her to reveal what she had been told to Ralph At first Madame Coralie had made some objection but on being assured that Shawe could and would keep his own counsel she consented that he should be told about the diamonds If he s hunting for the assassin and thinking that I am the one said Madame Coralie he will learn beforehand that I have the jewels and will not be ready to credit me with disposing of stolen gems Eddy is sometimes so careless that I fear lest the police should know I think it would be best to tell the police said Audrey wisely No the interest in the case has died away said her aunt and not even Joseph s reward of one thousand pounds can revive it Tell Mr Shawe by all means but warn him to keep his own counsel Audrey left Madame Coralie with the strange feeling so close was the resemblance between the sisters dead and alive that she had been conversing with her mother She returned home in a dream and then thought disconsolately that she was no nearer learning what she wished to know than she had been before But it was necessary to disabuse Perry Toat of the idea that the proprietress of the Pink Shop was guilty and Audrey determined to call at the appointed hour the next day Afterwards she could see Ralph and detail what she had learnt But to interview both her lover and the detective was not an easy task owing to the watch that was kept on her every action However Providence stood her friend unexpectedly Sir Joseph wished to drive some people down to Richmond for afternoon tea at the Star and Garter He invited Mrs Mellop to join the party but to punish Audrey for the way in which she had behaved to Lord Anvers he ordered her to remain at home His daughter disguised her satisfaction with difficulty and sent a wire to Ralph asking him to meet her at Perry Toat s at half past three o clock By that hour she would have put the detective off the scent and then could take Ralph aside and tell him all that she did not wish Miss Toat to learn Having arranged this she accompanied Mrs Mellop to the door where Sir Joseph in a magnificent motor car was waiting Mrs Mellop was rather doleful as she now knew that the millionaire had made up his mind on the authority of Audrey to marry Rosy Pearl But the widow did not intend to lose the prize without a struggle as it was much too valuable Besides having seen Miss Pearl on the music hall stage she did not think her a particularly formidable rival She determined on this day to be as fascinating as possible in order to carry off Sir Joseph from under the very nose of Rosy Pearl And as Mrs Mellop had a very good opinion of herself she thought that she would succeed So happy was she in the hope of success that she kissed Audrey in the hall You poor dear I wish you were coming she said affectionately Oh don t trouble yourself about me said Audrey who quite understood what the kiss meant Give all your attention to capturing my father Wouldn t you like me for a stepmother asked Mrs Mellop coaxingly I would like you better than Rosy Pearl said Audrey drily You will have my undying gratitude if you can save him from that woman Darling Mrs Mellop pecked again at Audrey s cheek with great delight at having enlisted her sympathy so far I shall do my best When the car glided away Audrey laughed She felt sure that Mrs Mellop would do her best She was also very certain that she would fail as Sir Joseph never changed his mind He had declared with indecent haste that he intended to marry the music hall artist and he would do so whatever obstacles were placed in the way Moreover Rosy Pearl was just the kind of fine woman whom the millionaire admired Mrs Mellop was a mere shrimp beside Miss Pearl s massive proportions and Sir Joseph did not care for diaphanous creatures of the widow s type However Mrs Mellop had intense faith in her own cleverness and in man s stupidity and went forth to conquer No wonder that Audrey knowing her father s adamantine nature laughed as the would be Lady Branwin fluttered out all smiles and chiffons If she s going out for wool she will come home shorn thought Audrey and went away to put on her quietest frock When she arrived at Buckingham Street Strand Miss Toat was duly waiting to hear what she had learnt Audrey had already arranged in her own mind what to say and sat down feeling quite cool and composed So calm did she seem that Miss Toat laughed in a vexed way So you have been unsuccessful you have learnt nothing she said promptly How do you know asked Audrey quickly You would be more excited if you had found a clue Well Miss Branwin she leant her elbows on the table perhaps I am wrong If you have learnt anything likely to be of value let me hear it I have learnt nothing said Audrey cautiously nothing of any value You got Madame Coralie to remove her yashmak Accident did that for me It was ripped off by a tack as she rose Well asked Perry Toat eagerly Well replied Miss Branwin coolly that s all But you had some conversation with her Yes But she could tell me nothing She merely repeated what she had said at the inquest that she left my mother in bed and came up the stairs to the still room Did you mention anything about the discrepancy in time Oh Audrey was really dismayed I quite forgot to Ah my dear young lady Perry Toat looked vexed again that is the most important question of the lot Although I daresay she added consolingly you would not have had a true reply I must look into the matter myself There is nothing to be learnt Miss Toat I am quite sure that Madame Coralie is innocent What makes you think so I observed her face and she did not change colour She told me all that I have told you with the greatest frankness Naturally said Miss Toat doubtfully she would be on her guard with you I don t think she was replied Audrey with studied simplicity besides she has promised to help me to find the criminal She is most anxious to do so because of her business I don t see how discovering the real criminal will improve the business Well Audrey looked pensive Madame Coralie is rather revengeful And very cunning What is to be done now You have failed I have not looked into everything yet Miss Toat I intend to call again on Madame Coralie I shall do so also said Perry Toat with determination for she recollected the large reward and felt anxious to obtain it Her visitor did not wish to forbid her calling again at the Pink Shop as such a request might have awakened Miss Toat s suspicions So she said nothing feeling certain that Madame Coralie was perfectly well able to look after herself Meanwhile Miss Toat having gathered all she wished to learn and feeling a faint suspicion that Audrey had not told her everything made up her mind to look into things for herself Then she turned the conversation so that Miss Branwin should not gather her intentions You made a conquest the other day said Miss Toat while Audrey rose to take her leave and smoothed her gloves Really The girl blushed What do you mean Colonel Ilse fell in love with you Audrey blushed again That nice military man who came as I went yesterday you mean don t you He is really charming such a nice smile If I wasn t engaged to Mr Shawe I might follow up my conquest Miss Toat shook her head You would be disappointed Colonel Ilse has buried his heart in the grave of the wife who died over twenty years ago If he can only find the daughter who was stolen from him he will be quite content Then I must be the same with Ralph said Audrey laughing Do you know Miss Toat Colonel Ilse put me in mind of someone I can t think who The detective nodded Curious you should say that I had an idea that I had seen someone like him But then these military men are all cut to one pattern See one and you see the lot Ah Come in She raised her voice as a knock came to the door Ralph entered looking smart and lover like Here I am Audrey he said Oh laughed Perry Toat rebukingly do you think that this is Cupid s Bureau What an unromantic place to meet in We have to meet in all manner of places said Audrey with a smile My father doesn t approve of our marriage and will not let Mr Shawe come to the house Good day Miss Toat We must be off When she went out looking up into her lover s face Perry Toat sighed The little office seemed more dingy than ever now that rosy love had flown away The detective returned to her papers rather discontentedly She also wished to walk out with a lover but there was no chance of that unless she gained this one thousand pounds which Sir Joseph Branwin offered for the detection of his wife s assassin The episode of Ralph meeting Audrey at the office and the sight of their love made the little woman more determined than ever to win the reward They are the butterflies said Miss Toat shuffling her papers and I am only the grub as yet So while the poor grub worked in the dull room the butterflies fluttered in the sunshine To be precise they drove in a taxi cab to their favourite meeting place near the Round Pond Here Audrey related how she had seen Madame Coralie and what had taken place Shawe was not easily astonished but on this occasion he confessed that he was It was surprising to learn that Madame Coralie was the sister of Lady Branwin and more surprising still to hear that she so easily confessed to having possession of the long lost diamonds Oh she must be innocent said the barrister after an astonished pause I can t conceive she would admit so much if she were guilty The very possession of the jewels would make the police certain of her guilt But the police must never know said Audrey anxiously Remember I tell you all this under seal of secrecy Oh I shall say nothing Ralph assured her seriously especially as your aunt has been so candid as to dispel any suspicions that I may have entertained regarding her complicity in the crime Then you don t believe in Perry Toat s theory No I certainly do not I have my own views What are they Shawe hesitated I shall tell you what they are when I am more certain of my suspicions Then you do suspect someone asked the girl swiftly Yes and no that is I have found a mare s nest Audrey looked at him carefully It struck her that his face was thin and pale and that his eyes looked remarkably dull You are worrying dear Yes over this case I really think Shawe passed his hand across his forehead that it would be best to leave it alone Audrey he took her hands and looked entreatingly into her face why not let sleeping dogs lie She shook her head I must learn who killed my mother Aunt Flora that is Madame Coralie will help me Why do you wish things to be left alone Because the wording of that anonymous letter haunts me said Shawe irritably If you search into this matter you will experience some very great grief Is it worth risking that For the sake of my mother s memory it is said the girl firmly My darling I assure you that your mother will rest no more quietly in her grave because her assassin is hanged Why not abandon the whole business and marry me at once I have not much money it is true but what I have is enough for both of us to live quietly No no no said Audrey insistently We discussed this matter before and I told you that I would not drag you down and hinder your career by saddling you with a poor wife and if I marry against my father s wishes I am bound to be poor Besides I have sworn to myself never to rest until the murderer of my poor mother is brought to justice If you won t help me and you certainly do not seem anxious to do so I must work alone Of course I shall help you snapped the barrister sharply I want to get at the truth as speedily as possible so that we may be married And to aid you in your search I now make a suggestion Audrey looked at him with interest What is it You say that your father admired Madame Coralie when she was Flora Arkwright of Bleakleigh Very good Flora Arkwright may have admired your father and may have grudged him marrying your mother Now why not go to Madame Coralie straight away and rouse her jealousy Rouse her jealousy Yes The Deceased Wife s Sister Bill is law now and there is no bar against Madame Coralie marrying Sir Joseph Yes there is You forget Eddy Vail Oh the deuce cried the barrister in dismay so I do Never mind it is as well to try the experiment Tell Madame Coralie that Sir Joseph is to marry Rosy Pearl and see what she will say For your dead mother s sake if not for her own she may resent the marriage Of course the idea is absurd said Audrey pettishly My aunt has not a shadow of excuse to object to my father marrying anyone What ever feelings she may have entertained for him once they have been parted too long for such feelings to exist now Well the experiment is worth trying insisted Ralph anxiously Audrey thought for a moment then rose and walked across the grass To set your mind at rest I shall see my aunt at once and tell her Good I shall wait at the door of the Pink Shop and hear your report With this understanding the two strolled across the Gardens to Walpole Lane and while Ralph lingered on the pavement Audrey passed into the Turkish shop She had chosen rather an awkward hour for an interview as Madame Coralie s clients were rolling up in carriage and motor brougham But the proprietress of the shop was upstairs in the still room and sent down word that she would see Miss Branwin at once The girl soon found herself in the presence of her aunt while Badoura who had introduced her returned to look after the customers who were being served by the other three girls I can only give you five minutes my dear said Madame Coralie who was again wearing her yashmak Is there anything wrong Nothing particularly but I thought that it was just as well you should know that my father has made up his mind to marry again What Madame Coralie gave a roar like that of a wounded lioness Who is the woman Miss Rosy Pearl of the That music hall creature impossible Madame Coralie clenched her hands and her black eyes looked extremely angry Why it was Rosy Pearl who was my other customer who slept in this house on the night of the crime Oh Audrey grew pale In a flash she saw what Madame Coralie meant gems growth economy management and customer satisfaction a crown studded with gems The
