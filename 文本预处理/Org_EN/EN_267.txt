Quite an exodus took place in Dawson in the spring Men because they had made stakes and other men because they had made none bought up the available dogs and rushed out for Dyea over the last ice Incidentally it was discovered that Dave Harney possessed most of these dogs Going out Jacob Welse asked him on a day when the meridian sun for the first time felt faintly warm to the naked skin Well I calkilate not I m clearin three dollars a pair on the moccasins I cornered to say nothing but saw wood on the boots Say Welse not that my nose is out of joint but you jest cinched me everlastin on sugar didn t you Jacob Welse smiled And by the Jimcracky I m squared Got any rubber boots No went out of stock early in the winter Dave snickered slowly And I m the pertickler party that hocus pocused em Not you I gave special orders to the clerks They weren t sold in lots No more they wa n t One man to the pair and one pair to the man and a couple of hundred of them but it was my dust they chucked into the scales an nobody else s Drink Don t mind Easy Put up your sack Call it rebate for I kin afford it Goin out Not this year I guess Wash up s comin A strike on Henderson the middle of April which promised to be sensational drew St Vincent to Stewart River And a little later Jacob Welse interested on Gallagher Gulch and with an eye riveted on the copper mines of White River went up into the same district and with him went Frona for it was more vacation than business In the mean time Corliss and Bishop who had been on trail for a month or more running over the Mayo and McQuestion Country rounded up on the left fork of Henderson where a block of claims waited to be surveyed But by May spring was so far advanced that travel on the creeks became perilous and on the last of the thawing ice the miners travelled down to the bunch of islands below the mouth of the Stewart where they went into temporary quarters or crowded the hospitality of those who possessed cabins Corliss and Bishop located on Split up Island so called through the habit parties from the Outside had of dividing there and going several ways where Tommy McPherson was comfortably situated A couple of days later Jacob Welse and Frona arrived from a hazardous trip out of White River and pitched tent on the high ground at the upper end of Split up A few chechaquos the first of the spring rush strung in exhausted and went into camp against the breaking of the river Also there were still men going out who barred by the rotten ice came ashore to build poling boats and await the break up or to negotiate with the residents for canoes Notably among these was the Baron Courbertin Ah Excruciating Magnificent Is it not So Frona first ran across him on the following day What she asked giving him her hand You You doffing his cap It is a delight I am sure she began No No He shook his curly mop warmly It is not you See He turned to a Peterborough for which McPherson had just mulcted him of thrice its value The canoe Is it not not what you Yankees call a bute Oh the canoe she repeated with a falling inflection of chagrin No No Pardon He stamped angrily upon the ground It is not so It is not you It is not the canoe It is ah I have it now It is your promise One day do you not remember at Madame Schoville s we talked of the canoe and of my ignorance which was sad and you promised you said I would give you your first lesson And is it not delightful Listen Do you not hear The rippling ah the rippling deep down at the heart of things Soon will the water run free Here is the canoe Here we meet The first lesson Delightful Delightful The next island below Split up was known as Roubeau s Island and was separated from the former by a narrow back channel Here when the bottom had about dropped out of the trail and with the dogs swimming as often as not arrived St Vincent the last man to travel the winter trail He went into the cabin of John Borg a taciturn gloomy individual prone to segregate himself from his kind It was the mischance of St Vincent s life that of all cabins he chose Borg s for an abiding place against the break up All right the man said when questioned by him Throw your blankets into the corner Bella ll clear the litter out of the spare bunk Not till evening did he speak again and then You re big enough to do your own cooking When the woman s done with the stove you can fire away The woman or Bella was a comely Indian girl young and the prettiest St Vincent had run across Instead of the customary greased swarthiness of the race her skin was clear and of a light bronze tone and her features less harsh more felicitously curved than those common to the blood After supper Borg both elbows on table and huge misshapen hands supporting chin and jaws sat puffing stinking Siwash tobacco and staring straight before him It would have seemed ruminative the stare had his eyes been softer or had he blinked as it was his face was set and trance like Have you been in the country long St Vincent asked endeavoring to make conversation Borg turned his sullen black eyes upon him and seemed to look into him and through him and beyond him and still regarding him to have forgotten all about him It was as though he pondered some great and weighty matter probably his sins the correspondent mused nervously rolling himself a cigarette When the yellow cube had dissipated itself in curling fragrance and he was deliberating about rolling a second Borg suddenly spoke Fifteen years he said and returned to his tremendous cogitation Thereat and for half an hour thereafter St Vincent fascinated studied his inscrutable countenance To begin with it was a massive head abnormal and top heavy and its only excuse for being was the huge bull throat which supported it It had been cast in a mould of elemental generousness and everything about it partook of the asymmetrical crudeness of the elemental The hair rank of growth thick and unkempt matted itself here and there into curious splotches of gray and again grinning at age twisted itself into curling locks of lustreless black locks of unusual thickness like crooked fingers heavy and solid The shaggy whiskers almost bare in places and in others massing into bunchgrass like clumps were plentifully splashed with gray They rioted monstrously over his face and fell raggedly to his chest but failed to hide the great hollowed cheeks or the twisted mouth The latter was thin lipped and cruel but cruel only in a passionless sort of way But the forehead was the anomaly the anomaly required to complete the irregularity of the face For it was a perfect forehead full and broad and rising superbly strong to its high dome It was as the seat and bulwark of some vast intelligence omniscience might have brooded there Bella washing the dishes and placing them away on the shelf behind Borg s back dropped a heavy tin cup The cabin was very still and the sharp rattle came without warning On the instant with a brute roar the chair was overturned and Borg was on his feet eyes blazing and face convulsed Bella gave an inarticulate animal like cry of fear and cowered at his feet St Vincent felt his hair bristling and an uncanny chill like a jet of cold air played up and down his spine Then Borg righted the chair and sank back into his old position chin on hands and brooding ponderously Not a word was spoken and Bella went on unconcernedly with the dishes while St Vincent rolled a shaky cigarette and wondered if it had been a dream Jacob Welse laughed when the correspondent told him Just his way he said for his ways are like his looks unusual He s an unsociable beast Been in the country more years than he can number acquaintances Truth to say I don t think he has a friend in all Alaska not even among the Indians and he s chummed thick with them off and on Johnny Sorehead they call him but it might as well be Johnny Break um head for he s got a quick temper and a rough hand Temper Some little misunderstanding popped up between him and the agent at Arctic City He was in the right too agent s mistake but he tabooed the Company on the spot and lived on straight meat for a year Then I happened to run across him at Tanana Station and after due explanations he consented to buy from us again Got the girl from up the head waters of the White Bill Brown told St Vincent Welse thinks he s pioneering in that direction but Borg could give him cards and spades on it and then win out He s been over the ground years ago Yes strange sort of a chap Wouldn t hanker to be bunk mates with him But St Vincent did not mind the eccentricities of the man for he spent most of his time on Split up Island with Frona and the Baron One day however and innocently he ran foul of him Two Swedes hunting tree squirrels from the other end of Roubeau Island had stopped to ask for matches and to yarn a while in the warm sunshine of the clearing St Vincent and Borg were accommodating them the latter for the most part in meditative monosyllables Just to the rear by the cabin door Bella was washing clothes The tub was a cumbersome home made affair and half full of water was more than a fair match for an ordinary woman The correspondent noticed her struggling with it and stepped back quickly to her aid With the tub between them they proceeded to carry it to one side in order to dump it where the ground drained from the cabin St Vincent slipped in the thawing snow and the soapy water splashed up Then Bella slipped and then they both slipped Bella giggled and laughed and St Vincent laughed back The spring was in the air and in their blood and it was very good to be alive Only a wintry heart could deny a smile on such a day Bella slipped again tried to recover slipped with the other foot and sat down abruptly Laughing gleefully both of them the correspondent caught her hands to pull her to her feet With a bound and a bellow Borg was upon them Their hands were torn apart and St Vincent thrust heavily backward He staggered for a couple of yards and almost fell Then the scene of the cabin was repeated Bella cowered and grovelled in the muck and her lord towered wrathfully over her Look you he said in stifled gutturals turning to St Vincent You sleep in my cabin and you cook That is enough Let my woman alone Things went on after that as though nothing had happened St Vincent gave Bella a wide berth and seemed to have forgotten her existence But the Swedes went back to their end of the island laughing at the trivial happening which was destined to be significant exodus v
