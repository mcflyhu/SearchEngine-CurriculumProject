I had no thought where they were taking me only looked here and there for the appearance of a ship and there ran the while in my head a word of Ransome s the twenty pounders If I were to be exposed a second time to that same former danger of the plantations I judged it must turn ill with me there was no second Alan and no second shipwreck and spare yard to be expected now and I saw myself hoe tobacco under the whip s lash The thought chilled me the air was sharp upon the water the stretchers of the boat drenched with a cold dew and I shivered in my place beside the steersman This was the dark man whom I have called hitherto the Lowlander his name was Dale ordinarily called Black Andie Feeling the thrill of my shiver he very kindly handed me a rough jacket full of fish scales with which I was glad to cover myself I thank you for this kindness said I and will make so free as to repay it with a warning You take a high responsibility in this affair You are not like [pg ]these ignorant barbarous Highlanders but know what the law is and the risks of those that break it I am no just exactly what ye would ca an extremist for the law says he at the best of times but in this business I act with a good warranty What are you going to do with me I asked Nae harm said he nae harm ava Ye ll hae strong freens I m thinking Ye ll be richt eneuch yet There began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea little dabs of pink and like coals of slow fire came in the east and at the same time the geese awakened and began crying about the top of the Bass It is just the one crag of rock as everybody knows but great enough to carve a city from The sea was extremely little but there went a hollow plowter round the base of it With the growing of the dawn I could see it clearer and clearer the straight crags painted with sea birds droppings like a morning frost the sloping top of it green with grass the clan of white geese that cried about the sides and the black broken buildings of the prison sitting close on the sea s edge At the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap It s there you re taking me I cried Just to the Bass mannie said he whaur the auld sants were afore ye and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your preeson But none dwells there now I cried the place is long a ruin [pg ] It ll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese then quoth Andie dryly The day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge among the big stones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats several kegs and baskets and a provision of fuel All these were discharged upon the crag Andie myself and my three Highlanders I call them mine although it was the other way about landed along with them The sun was not yet up when the boat moved away again the noise of the oars on the thole pins echoing from the cliffs and left us in our singular reclusion Andie Dale was the Prefect as I would jocularly call him of the Bass being at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that small and rich estate He had to mind the dozen or so of sheep that fed and fattened on the grass of the sloping part of it like beasts grazing the roof of a cathedral He had charge besides of the solan geese that roosted in the crags and from these an extraordinary income is derived The young are dainty eating as much as two shillings a piece being a common price and paid willingly by epicures even the grown birds are valuable for their oil and feathers and a part of the minister s stipend of North Berwick is paid to this day in solan geese which makes it in some folks eyes a parish to be coveted To perform these several businesses as well as to protect the geese from poachers Andie had frequent occasion [pg ]to sleep and pass days together on the crag and we found the man at home there like a farmer in his steading Bidding us all shoulder some of the packages a matter in which I made haste to bear a hand he led us in by a locked gate which was the only admission to the island and through the ruins of the fortress to the governor s house There we saw by the ashes in the chimney and a standing bed place in one corner that he made his usual occupation This bed he now offered me to use saying he supposed I would set up to be gentry My gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie said I I bless God I have lain hard ere now and can do the same again with thankfulness While I am here Mr Andie if that be your name I will do my part and take my place beside the rest of you and I ask you on the other hand to spare me your mockery which I own I like ill He grumbled a little at this speech but seemed upon reflection to approve it Indeed he was a long headed sensible man and a good Whig and Presbyterian read daily in a pocket Bible and was both able and eager to converse seriously on religion leaning more than a little towards the Cameronian extremes His morals were of a more doubtful colour I found he was deep in the free trade and used the ruins of Tantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise As for a gauger I do not believe he valued the life of one at half a farthing [pg ]But that part of the coast of Lothian is to this day as wild a place and the commons there as rough a crew as any in Scotland One incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence it had long after There was a warship at this time stationed in the Firth the Seahorse Captain Palliser It chanced she was cruising in the month of September plying between Fife and Lothian and sounding for sunk dangers Early one fine morning she was seen about two miles to east of us where she lowered a boat and seemed to examine the Wildfire Rocks and Satan s Bush famous dangers of that coast And presently after having got her boat again she came before the wind and was headed directly for the Bass This was very troublesome to Andie and the Highlanders the whole business of my sequestration was designed for privacy and here with a navy captain perhaps blundering ashore it looked to become public enough if it were nothing worse I was in a minority of one I am no Alan to fall upon so many and I was far from sure that a warship was the least likely to improve my condition All which considered I gave Andie my parole of good behaviour and obedience and was had briskly to the summit of the rock where we all lay down at the cliff s edge in different places of observation and concealment The Seahorse came straight on till I thought she would have struck and we looking giddily down could see the ship s company at their [pg ]quarters and hear the leadsman singing at the lead Then she suddenly wore and let fly a volley of I know not how many great guns The rock was shaken with the thunder of the sound the smoke flowed over our heads and the geese rose in number beyond computation or belief To hear their screaming and to see the twinkling of their wings made a most inimitable curiosity and I suppose it was after this somewhat childish pleasure that Captain Palliser had come so near the Bass He was to pay dear for it in time During his approach I had the opportunity to make a remark upon the rigging of that ship by which I ever after knew it miles away and this was a means under Providence of my averting from a friend a great calamity and inflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible disappointment All the time of my stay on the rock we lived well We had small ale and brandy and oatmeal of which we made our porridge night and morning At times a boat came from the Castleton and brought us a quarter of mutton for the sheep upon the rock we must not touch these being specially fed to market The geese were unfortunately out of season and we let them be We fished ourselves and yet more often made the geese to fish for us observing one when he had made a capture and scaring him from his prey ere he had swallowed it The strange nature of this place and the curiosities with which it abounded held me busy and amused [pg ]Escape being impossible I was allowed my entire liberty and continually explored the surface of the isle wherever it might support the foot of man The old garden of the prison was still to be observed with flowers and pot herbs running wild and some ripe cherries on a bush A little lower stood a chapel or a hermit s cell who built or dwelt in it none may know and the thought of its age made a ground of many meditations The prison too where I now bivouacked with Highland cattle thieves was a place full of history both human and divine I thought it strange so many saints and martyrs should have gone by there so recently and left not so much as a leaf out of their Bibles or a name carved upon the wall while the rough soldier lads that mounted guard upon the battlements had filled the neighbourhood with their mementoes broken tobacco pipes for the most part and that in a surprising plenty but also metal buttons from their coats There were times when I thought I could have heard the pious sound of psalms out of the martyrs dungeons and seen the soldiers tramp the ramparts with their glinting pipes and the dawn rising behind them out of the North Sea No doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put these fancies in my head He was extraordinary well acquainted with the story of the rock in all particulars down to the names of private soldiers his father having served there in that same capacity [pg ]He was gifted besides with a natural genius for narration so that the people seemed to speak and the things to be done before your face This gift of his and my assiduity to listen brought us the more close together I could not honestly deny but what I liked him I soon saw that he liked me and indeed from the first I had set myself out to capture his good will An odd circumstance to be told presently effected this beyond my expectation but even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a prisoner and his gaoler I should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay upon the Bass was wholly disagreeable It seemed to me a safe place as though I was escaped there out of my troubles No harm was to be offered me a material impossibility rock and the deep sea prevented me from fresh attempts I felt I had my life safe and my honour safe and there were times when I allowed myself to gloat on them like stolen waters At other times my thoughts were very different I recalled how strong I had expressed myself both to Rankeillor and to Stewart I reflected that my captivity upon the Bass in view of a great part of the coasts of Fife and Lothian was a thing I should be thought more likely to have invented than endured and in the eyes of these two gentlemen at least I must pass for a boaster and a coward Now I would take this lightly enough tell myself that so [pg ]long as I stood well with Catriona Drummond the opinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and spilled water and thence pass off into those meditations of a lover which are so delightful to himself and must always appear so surprisingly idle to a reader But anon the fear would take me otherwise I would be shaken with a perfect panic of self esteem and these supposed hard judgments appear an injustice impossible to be supported With that another train of thought would be presented and I had scarce begun to be concerned about men s judgments of myself than I was haunted with the remembrance of James Stewart in his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife Then indeed passion began to work in me I could not forgive myself to sit there idle it seemed if I were a man at all that I could fly or swim out of my place of safety and it was in such humours and to amuse my self reproaches that I would set the more particularly to win the good side of Andie Dale At last when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on a bright morning I put in some hint about a bribe He looked at me cast back his head and laughed out loud Ay you re funny Mr Dale said I but perhaps if you glance an eye upon that paper you may change your note The stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure nothing but hard money and the [pg ]paper I now showed Andie was an acknowledgment from the British Linen Company for a considerable sum He read it Troth and ye re nane sae ill aff said he I thought that would maybe vary your opinions said I Hout said he It shaws me ye can bribe but I m no to be bribit We ll see about that yet a while says I And first I ll show you that I know what I am talking You have orders to detain me here till Thursday st September Ye re no a thegether wrong either says Andie I m to let ye gang bar orders contrair on Saturday the rd I could not but feel there was something extremely insidious in this arrangement That I was to reappear precisely in time to be too late would cast the more discredit on my tale if I were minded to tell one and this screwed me to fighting point Now then Andie you that kens the world listen to me and think while ye listen said I I know there are great folks in the business and I make no doubt you have their names to go upon I have seen some of them myself since this affair began and said my say into their faces too But what kind of a crime would this be that I had committed or what kind of a [pg ]process is this that I am fallen under To be apprehended by some ragged John Hielandmen on August th carried to a rickle of old stones that is now neither fort nor gaol whatever it once was but just the gamekeeper s lodge of the Bass Rock and set free again September d as secretly as I was first arrested does that sound like law to you or does it sound like justice or does it not sound honestly like a piece of some low dirty intrigue of which the very folk that meddle with it are ashamed I canna gainsay ye Shaws It looks unco underhand says Andie And werenae the folk guid sound Whigs and true blue Presbyterians I would hae seen them ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have set hand to it The Master of Lovat ll be a braw Whig says I and a grand Presbyterian I ken naething by him said he I hae nae trokings wi Lovats No it ll be Prestongrange that you ll be dealing with said I Ah but I ll no tell ye that said Andie Little need when I ken was my retort There s just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of Shaws says Andie And that is that try as ye please I m no dealing wi yoursel nor yet I amnae goin to he added Well Andie I see I ll have to be speak out plain [pg ]with you I replied And I told him so much as I thought needful of the facts He heard me out with serious interest and when I had done seemed to consider a little with himself Shaws said he at last I deal with the naked hand It s a queer tale and no vary creditable the way you tell it and I m far frae minting that is other than the way that ye believe it As for yoursel ye seems to me rather a dacent like young man But me that s aulder and mair judeecious see perhaps a wee bit further forrit in the job than what ye can dae And here is the maitter clear and plain to ye There ll be nae skaith to yoursel if I keep ye here far frae that I think ye ll be a hantle better by it There ll be nae skaith to the kintry just ae mair Hielantman hangit Gude kens a guid riddance On the ither hand it would be considerable skaith to me if I would let you free Sae speakin as a guid Whig an honest freen to you and an anxious freen to my ainsel the plain fact is that I think ye ll just have to bide here wi Andie an the solans Andie said I laying my hand upon his knee this Hielantman s innocent Ay it s
