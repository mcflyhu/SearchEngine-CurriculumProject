Achilles sprang forward She s all right Mr Harris all right His hand dropped to the trembling shoulder and rested there as his quiet voice repeated the words He bent forward and lifted the child in his arms and moved away with her But before he had traversed the long hall the little head had fallen forward on his shoulder and the child slept Behind the velvet curtain the voice of Conner wrestled faintly with the telephone and all about them great lights glowed on the walls they lighted the great staircase that swept mistily up and the figure of Achilles mounting slowly in the stately lonely house the child in his arms His hand steadied the sleeping head with careful touch against his shoulder They were not jolting now in heavy cars through the traffic streets or wandering on the plain Little Betty Harris had come home Above them at the top of the long stairs a grey figure appeared and paused a moment and looked down Then Miss Stone descended swiftly her hands outstretched they did not touch the sleeping child but hovered above her with a look half pain half joy Achilles smiled to her She come home he whispered She turned with quick breath and they mounted the stairs the child still asleep through the long corridor to the princess s room beyond with its soft lights and great silken hangings and canopied bed open for the night waiting for Betty Harris Achilles bent and laid her down with lightest touch and straightened himself We let her sleep he said gently She very tired They stood looking down at the brown face and the little tired lip and sleeping lids Their eyes met and they smiled They knew these two out of all the world they knew what it meant that the child was safe And out in the glowing dawn the great car thundered home and Betty Harris s mother looked out with swift eyes See Phil the sun is up She reached out her hand Sit still Louie don t tremble so he said gently She is safe now They have brought her home She s there you know asleep He spoke slowly as if to a child He was gathering up the morning in his heart this big harsh master of men his little girl was safe and a common Greek a man out of the streets peddling bananas and calling up and down had made his life worth living His big tense mind gripped the fact and held it Something seemed speaking to him out of the east over there past the rushing car A common Greek He had flung his wealth and hammered hard but somehow this man had loved her his little girl Phil she said softly Yes dear Are we almost home He looked out Half an hour yet sit still Louie He held her hand close Sit still he said and the miles slipped past She is there Phil Yes They wouldn t lie to me All these weeks she said softly I don t think I could bear it much longer Phil The tears were on her cheeks raining down and he put his rough face against her adrift in a new world And over the great lake the sun burst out on a flashing car and the door flung wide to Betty Harris s mother flying with swift sure foot up the great stone steps This way ma am she s in here her own room this way ma am She was kneeling by the great canopied bed her head bent very low The brown face trembled a breath the child put up a hand in her dream Mother dear she said and dreamed on bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them velvet n adj This material feels like velvet The new settlers wore the finest silk and velvet clothing wrestled v wrestle As a boy he had boxed and wrestled Armed guards wrestled with the intruder mistily adv My wife is patting Run er inside the house murmuring lullaby mistily Bits of tulle and fuzzy yarn hang mistily from the rafters jolting adj she should be all right from the plane s jolting by now This is perhaps the most jolting comment of all descended a A mood of melancholy descended on us The path descended the hill in a series of zigzags hovered hover A hawk hovered over the hill A hawk hovered in the blue sky canopied adj Mist canopied the city The centrepiece was a magnificent canopied bed belonged to Talleyrand the great th century French diplomat spoke n v speak They sourced the spoke nuts from our company The spokes of a wheel are the bars that connect the outer ring to the centre gathering n He called on Mr White to speak at the gathering He is on the wing gathering material for his novels
