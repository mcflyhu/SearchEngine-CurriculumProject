You can imagine after that disappointment in Philadelphia it seems an unfeeling way to speak of the death of an old gentleman how we all turned our eyes and kept them fixed on Tony Ford Friday night Babbitts told me the hospital had reported he couldn t be seen till Monday The others were in a fever he said O Mally smoking big black cigars by the gross and Jack Reddy gone off to Buffalo and Mr George that scared Ford would slip off some way he d have liked to put a cordon of the National Guard round the hospital Then came Saturday and Gee up everything burst different to what anybody had expected It started with Mr George Being so nervous he couldn t rest he called up the hospital in the morning and got word that there d been a mistake in the message of the day before and that Mr Ford was well enough to see the Philadelphia detectives that afternoon Before midday Babbitts and O Mally were gathered in and while I was waiting on pins and needles in Ninety fifth Street and Jack Reddy was off unsuspecting in Buffalo the two of them were planted by Tony Ford s bedside hearing the story that lifted the Harland case one peg higher in its surprise and grewsomeness O Mally and Babbitts had their plans all laid beforehand They were two plain clothes men from Philadelphia who had just come on a new lead the finding of Sammis When they d opened that up before him they were going to pass on to the murder take him by surprise If Ford made the confession they hoped to shake out of him the warrant for his arrest would be issued and the Harland case come before the public in its true light Babbitts had never seen Ford and when he described him to me it didn t sound like the same man He was lying propped up with pillows his head swathed in bandages and his face pale and haggard Under the covers his long legs stretched most to the end of the cot and his big powerful hands were lying limp on the counterpane He was in a private room in an inside wing of the hospital very quiet and retired When the attendant left and they introduced themselves he looked sort of scowling from one to the other Both noticed the same thing a kind of uneasiness as if his apprehensions were aroused and for all his broken head he was on the job not weak and indifferent but wary and alert This wasn t what they wanted so they started in telling him the news they thought would please him and put him at his ease A clue had been picked up in Philadelphia that looked like the mystery of his attack was solved In fact says O Mally a man s been run to earth there that we re pretty sure is the one Both men were watching him and both saw a change come over him that caught their eyes and held them Instead of being relieved he was scared Have you got the man he said O Mally nodded That s what we have Who is he Party called Sammis Answers to the description Before he could go further Ford raised himself on his elbow looking downright terrified Joseph Sammis he said his eyes set staring on O Mally That s it We tracked him up and found him But I don t want to raise any false hopes We were too late When we got there he was dead It had an extraordinary effect upon Ford He gave a gasp and raised himself up into a sitting posture his mouth open his eyes glued on O Mally For a minute not one of them said a word Ford evidently too paralyzed at what he d heard and the others too surprised at the way Ford was acting which was exactly different to what they d expected It was he who spoke first his voice gone down to a husky murmur Dead O Mally answered Heart disease angina pectoris The doctor down there said some strain or effort had finished him That as we see it was the attack he made on you Then Ford did the most surprising thing of all Raising his hands he clapped both over his face and with a big heaving sob from the bottom of his chest fell back on the pillows and began to cry Babbitts said you couldn t have believed it if you hadn t seen it he and O Mally looking stumped at each other and between them that great ox of a man lying in the bed crying like a baby Then Himself being fearful that maybe they d done the man harm rose up to go after a nurse but O Mally caught him by the coat whispering Keep still you goat then turned and said very pleasant to Ford Knocked you out old man That s natural nerves still weak Keep it up till you feel better Don t mind us we re used to it So there they sat Babbitts still uneasy but O Mally calm and patient tilting back in his chair looking dreamy out of the window He said afterward that he knew that hysterical fit for what it was relief and that was why he wouldn t let Babbitts call a nurse Presently the sobs began to ease off and Ford groping under the pillow for a handkerchief said all choked up How did you come to connect him with me By papers found in his desk records of a real estate business you and he d been in some years ago at Syracuse That s the man said Ford between his hiccuppy catches of breath and he s dead Dead as Julius C sar O Mally leaned forward his voice dropping You knew he was the chap that attacked you Ford his head drooped his shoulders hunched up like an old woman s nodded Yes I lied when I said he was a stranger to me Why did you do that asked Babbitts It was just what you might know he d ask One of the cutest things about Himself is that he never can understand why anyone no matter what the provocation has to lie Ford didn t answer and O Mally giving his chair a hitch nearer to the bed said kind and persuasive Say Ford you d better tell us all you know We got the papers and most of the information The man s dead Clean it up and we ll let it drop Without raising his head Ford said low and sort of sullen All right if you agree to that I was in business with him and I I didn t play fair lit out with some of the money He turned a lowering look on Babbitts That s the answer to your question then back to O Mally I didn t run across him or hear of him in all this time and supposed the whole thing was buried and forgotten till he came into my room Tuesday night He was blazing mad said he d been waiting for a chance to even up and had at last found me To keep him quiet I said I d give him some money I had some Yes yes said O Mally nodding cheerfully the legacy your uncle left you Ford shot a look at him sharp and quick Oh you know about that Naturally Inquiries have been made in all directions Go on I hadn t much cash there a few dollars but I thought I d hand him that and agree to pay him more later He said he didn t want money that wouldn t square our accounts and as I went to the desk he came up behind me and struck me That s all I know Did he say how he d located you Yes He d been looking for me ever since I d skipped but couldn t find me Then he saw my name in the papers after the Harland suicide Some fool reporter spoke to me in the street that night and I told him who I was and where I worked A short while after Sammis phoned up to the Black Eagle Building heard from Miss Whitehall I d left and got from her my house address Did he say what he was doing in Philadelphia He had some new job there he didn t say what but he said he was well paid That came out in his blustering about not wanting my money There was a pause Babbitts and O Mally scribbling in their note books Ford sitting up in that hunched position looking surly at his hands lying on the counterpane So far every word he d said tallied with what they already knew Babbitts was wondering how O Mally was going to get round to the real business of the interview when the detective suddenly raised up from his notes and leaning forward tapped lightly on one of Ford s hands with the point of his pencil Say Ford how about that legacy from your uncle Ford gave a start stiffened up and looked quick as a flash into the detective s face What about it he stammered O Mally his body bending forward his pencil tip still on Ford s hand said with sudden grim meaning We know where it came from For a second they eyed each other Babbitts said it looked like an electric current was passing between them holding them as still as if they were mesmerized Then O Mally went on very low each word falling slow and clear from his lips We know all about that money and the game you ve been playing This Sammis business isn t what we re here for It s the other the Harland matter the thing that s been occupying your time and thoughts lately That outside job of yours that job that was finished on the night of January the fifteenth He paused and Ford s glance slid away from him his eyes like the eyes of a trapped animal traveling round the walls of the room We ve got you Ford The whole thing s in our hands Your only chance is to tell tell everything you know In describing it to me Babbitts said that moment was one of the tensest in the whole case Ford was cornered you could see he knew it and you could see the consciousness of guilt in his pallid face and trembling hands O Mally was like a hunter that has his prey at last in sight drawn forward to the edge of his chair his jaw squared his eyes piercing into Ford like gimlets Go ahead he almost whispered What was that money paid you for Ford tried to smile the ghost of that cock sure grin distorting his face like a grimace I guess you ve got the goods on me he said I know when I m beaten You needn t try any third degree I ll tell Babbitts was so excited he could hardly breathe The Big Story was his at last he was going to hear the murderer s confession from his own lips Ford lifted his head and holding it high and defiant looked at O Mally and said slowly I got that money from Hollings Harland for reporting to him the affair between Johnston Barker and Miss Whitehall If you d hit him in the head with a brick Babbitts said he couldn t have been more knocked out He had sense enough to smother the exclamation that nearly burst from him but he did square round in his chair and look aghast at O Mally That old bird never gave a sign that he d got a blow in the solar plexus For all anyone could guess by his face it was just what he d expected to hear You were in Harland s pay he murmured nodding his head I was in Harland s pay from the first of December to the day of his death In that time he gave me eight hundred dollars O Mally slouching comfortable against his chair back drooped his head toward his shoulder and said Suppose you tell us the whole thing straight from the start It ll be easier that way Any way you want it said Ford It s all the same to me I first met Harland in the elevator some time in the end of November Seeing me every day he spoke to me casually and civilly as one man does to another There was nothing more than that till Johnston Barker began coming to the Azalea Woods Estates then bit by bit Harland grew more friendly I ll admit I was flattered a chap in my position doesn t usually get more than a passing nod from a man in his As he warmed up toward me feeling his way with questions I began to get a line on what he was after he wanted a tab kept on Barker Jealous O Mally suggested Desperately jealous As soon as the thing opened up before me I saw how matters stood He was secretly crazy about Miss Whitehall and was easy until Barker cut in then he got alarmed Barker was a bigger man than he and there was no doubt about it that she liked Barker When he realized that he put it up to me straight He d sized me up pretty thoroughly by that time and knew that I d what s the use of mincing matters do his dirty work for him O Mally inclined his head as if he was too polite to contradict He offered me good money and all I had to do was to watch her and Barker and report what I heard or saw It was a cinch I was on the spot the only other person in the office a fool of a stenographer a girl who hardly counted What was the result of your er investigations That Barker was in love with her too He came often on a flimsy excuse that he wanted to build a house in the tract She was friendly at first then for a while very cold and haughty as if they might have had a quarrel Then they seemed to make that up and get as thick as thieves Did she seem to care for Harland Not exactly anyway not the way he did for her She was always awfully nice to him the few times he came into the office gentle and sweet but not the way she was with Barker She was two different women to them with Harland a sort of affable gracious winner but with Barker a girl with a man she s fond of natural glad to see him no society stunts A little before Christmas I caught on to the fact that she was receiving letters from Barker and Harland offered me extra money if I d get their contents This wasn t so easy Generally she took them away with her but twice she left them on her desk All I had to do then was to stay overtime and when she was gone copy them That way I got on to something that phazed us both she and Barker were up to some scheme O Mally moved slightly in his chair Scheme he said What do you mean by scheme Something they were planning to do After Christmas every time he d come they d go into the private office and talk there so low you couldn t catch a word And the letters were all about it but we couldn t get a line on what it was I ll show them to you and you ll see for yourself It got Harland wild for though they weren t exactly love letters they showed that she and Barker were close knit in some secret enterprise Did you continue this work till the day of the suicide I did to the night to the time it happened Harland was getting more and more worked up I don t know whether it was the Barker Whitehall business or his own financial worries but I could see he was holding the lid on with difficulty That day January fifteenth as you may remember he was in her office and had a talk with her As he went out I saw that he looked cheered up brisk and confident Of course I ve no idea what she said to him but knowing the state he was in I ll swear it was something that gave him hope Yet a few hours after that he killed himself Seeing him so heartened up and being curious myself I decided to stay that evening and do a little quiet snooping among her papers But she nearly blocked that game She was in the habit of going between half past five and six leaving me to close up That night she didn t do it but hung about in the office and after watching her for a few minutes I saw that she was on the jump moving about going from one desk to the other glancing at the clock Her manner made me certain that something was up it was possible it had to do with the scheme she and Barker were hatching I got the idea that I d go and come back after a while on the chance of stumbling on something that would be useful to my employer I left her there and after loafing round for about half an hour returned The office was dark and she d gone I lit up and looked over her desk in the Exhibit Room and a table in my room where she kept some papers but found nothing Then I thought I d take a look into the private office but that door was locked Ah locked said O Mally calm as a summer sea Was that her custom Not as far as I knew I d never found it locked before It gave me an uneasy feeling for I thought she might have suspected what I was doing and turned the key against any invasion of her particular sanctum She was no fool and might have caught on So I fixed up the papers as I found them and left the office You know what time that was or you do if you read of the Harland suicide I ve always supposed the poor chap was up that side corridor as I stood there waiting for the car Babbitts bent over his notebook scribbling he had to hide his face He told me he thought the expression on it of stunned crestfallen blankness would have given him away to an idiot Waiting with their ears stretched to hear a confession of murder and this was what they got And the man wasn t lying Every word he d said matched with the facts we d been worming and digging to find He couldn t possibly have known murder had been discovered he hadn t any suspicion a murder had been committed The great revelation that was to have broken on the public with an explosion like a dynamite bomb was that Tony Ford was Harland s paid spy Well he said looking at O Mally what have you got to say Go ahead with it if it ll give you any satisfaction Only you needn t waste your breath I know without being told that it s a rotten dirty business O Mally his face as red as the harvest moon pulled at his mustache looking thoughtful But sore as he must have been you d have to know O Mally to realize what his disappointment was he answered cool and easy I ain t got anything to say It s not my job to train the young You ve told me what I wanted to know that s all I m here for Ford turned to Babbitts and asked him to get some letters off the table and then went on to O Mally How did you come to find it out Babbitts gathering up the letters cocked his head to listen wondering how O Mally was going to get out of it But you couldn t phaze that veteran Several ways you see what we re after is Johnston Barker It s the Copper Pool that owns us and nosing round in our quiet little way we got on to the Barker Whitehall affair and from that followed the scent to that legacy of yours We didn t altogether believe in that uncle up state thought maybe he was Johnston Barker in private life and that you might know something he gave a lazy good humored laugh Got fooled all round I don t mind telling you now that the way we happened on Sammis was pure accident Thought he was Barker and had him shadowed He looked like enough to him to have been his brother That s so said Ford as Babbitts handed him the letters especially with his hat on I noticed it myself He selected two papers from the bunch and handed them to O Mally There those are the letters I spoke of This one he flicked it across the counterpane is just a note from Harland making a date I don t know how I happened to keep it They were the three letters Babbitts had taken after the attack copies of which at that moment were lying in O Mally s pocket It was not till they were out on the hospital steps that they dared to speak O Mally s face was a study his mouth drooped down to his chin and his eyes dismal and despairing like he d come from a tragedy Well he said what do you make of that Zero Not a thing to do with it hasn t a suspicion of it no more involved in it than that sparrow there he pointed to a sparrow that had lit on the step near by I ve had setbacks in my profession before but this He stopped stuck his hands into his pockets and stared blankly at the sparrow Well if it lets him out said Babbitts it tightens the cords round the other two Um agreed O Mally still gazing stonily at the sparrow that s what keeps your spirits up With him eliminated the whole thing concentrates on her and Barker It does my son O Mally roused up and came out of his depression Instead of a brain and a pair of hands as we ve called it it was a brain and one hand the smart hand the right That was the woman He turned and began to descend the steps taking Babbitts by the arm to draw him closer and speaking low Do you see how it went They were in the private office when Ford came back she and Barker and the dead man When they heard him come they switched off the light and locked the door and Great Scott can you imagine how they felt Shut in there in the dark with their victim not knowing who Ford could be or what he was doing listening to him rummaging round his steps coming nearer his hand on the doorknob I m too familiar with murder to see any terrors in it but that situation I ve never known the beat of it in all my experience Then when Ford goes on his very heels over and out with the thing they d killed And both of them back there again or maybe stealing to the front windows and taking a look down at the crowd below They walked up the street arm in arm talking in hushed voices As he looked at the faces of the people that passed the thought came to Babbitts that in a short time maybe a few days they d
