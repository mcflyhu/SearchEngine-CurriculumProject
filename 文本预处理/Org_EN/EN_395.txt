Three days later it was Easter Day In the evening about half past nine when Thomas lay sleeping and Peter was packing the rugs and cushions and pictures he hadn t paid for into brown paper parcels a tedious job Rodney came in Peter hadn t seen him for some time What on earth said Rodney lighting his pipe and sitting down are you doing with all that upholstery Has someone been sending you Easter presents Well I m glad you re getting rid of them as speedily as may be Peter said ruefully because he was tired of the business The stupid things aren t paid for So I m packing them up to be sent back directly the shops open again I can t afford them you see Already most of my belongings are in pawn I see Rodney wasn t specially struck by this it was the chronic condition of many of his friends who were largely of the class who pawn their clothes on Monday and redeem them on Saturday to wear for Sunday and pawn them again paying if they can afford it a penny extra to have the dresses hung up so that they don t crush A sudden attack of honesty Rodney commented Well I m glad because I don t see what you want to cumber yourself with all those cushions and rugs for You re quite comfortable enough without them Peter said Thomas and I wanted nice things to look at We were tired of horse hair and Grace Sufficient Thomas is fastidious Rodney put a large finger on Thomas head Thomas isn t such a fool Hullo there s another of you Francesco woke and came out of his corner and laid his nose on Rodney s knee with his confiding grin Yes that s San Francesco Rather nice isn t he He s coming with us too I called him Francesco instead of Francis that he might feel at home in Italy Oh in Italy Peter hadn t meant to tell Rodney that because he didn t think that Rodney would approve and he wanted to avoid an argument But he had let it out of course he could never keep anything in That s where we re going to morrow to seek our fortunes Won t it be rather good in Italy now We don t know what we shall do when we get there or where we shall go but something nice for sure I m glad said Rodney It s a good country in the spring Shall you walk the roads with Thomas slung over your back or what I don t know Partly I daresay But we want to find some little place between the hills and the sea and stay there Perhaps for always I don t know It s going to be extraordinarily nice anyhow Rodney glanced at him caught by the ring in his voice a ring he hadn t heard for long He didn t quite understand Peter When last he saw him he had been very far through alarmingly near the bottom Was this recovery natural grace or had something happened It seemed to Rodney rather admirable and he looked appreciatively at Peter s cheerful face and happy eyes Good he said Good splendid And then Peter meeting his pleased look and understanding it winced back from it and coloured and bent over his brown paper and string He valued Rodney s appreciation a thing not easily won He felt that in this moment he had won it as he had never won it before For he knew that Rodney liked pluck and was thinking him plucky Against his will he muttered half beneath his breath Oh it isn t really what you call good It is good you know I think it s good but you won t You ll call it abominable Oh said Rodney Peter went on with a new violence I know all you ll say about it so I m not going to give you the opportunity of saying it till I m gone You needn t think I m going to tell you now and let you tell me I m wrong I m not wrong and if I am I don t care Please don t stay any more I d rather you weren t here to night I don t want to tell you anything only I had just got to say that because you were thinking Oh do go now Rodney sat quite still and looked at him into him through him beyond him Then he said You needn t tell me anything I know Lucy and you are going together Peter stood up rather unsteadily Well That s not clever Any fool could have guessed that Yes And any fool could guess what I m going to say about it too You know it all already of course Rodney was groping for words helplessly blindly Peter I didn t know you had it in you to be a cad Peter was putting books into a portmanteau and did not answer You mean to do that to Denis Peter put in socks and handkerchiefs And to Lucy I don t understand you Peter I simply don t understand Are you mad or drunk or didn t I really ever know you in the least Peter stuffed in Thomas nightgowns crumpling them hideously Very well said Rodney very quietly It doesn t particularly matter which it is In any case you are not going to do it I shall prevent it You can t Peter flung at him crushing a woolly rabbit in among Thomas clothes Rodney sat still and looked at him resting his chin on his hand looked into him through him beyond him I believe I can he said simply Peter stopped filling the bag and still sitting on the floor by it delivered himself at last We care for each other Isn t that to count then We always have cared for each other Are we to do without each other for always We want each other we need each other Denis doesn t need Lucy He never did not as I do Are Lucy and I to do without each other living only half a life because of him I tell you I m sick to death of doing without things The time has come when it won t do any more and I m going to take what I can I think I would rob anyone quite cheerfully if he had what I wanted A few days ago I did rob I bought things I knew I couldn t pay for I m sending them back now simply because I don t want them any more not because I m sorry I took them It was fair I should take them it was my turn to have things mine and Thomas s And now I m going to take this and keep it till it s taken away from me I daresay it will be taken away soon my things always are Everything has broken and gone one thing after another all my life all the things I ve cared for I m tired of it I was sick of it by the time I was ten years old sick of always getting ill or smashed up and that s gone on ever since and people have always thought I know Oh it s only him he never minds anything he doesn t count he s just a crock and his only use is to play the fool for us But I did mind I did And I only played the fool because it would have been drearier still not to and because there was always something amusing left to laugh at not because I didn t mind And then I cared for Denis as Oh but you know how I cared for Denis He was the most bright and splendid thing I knew in all the splendid world and he chucked me because everything went wrong that could go wrong between us without my fault and our friendship was spoilt And I cared for Hilary and Peggy and they would go and do things to spoil all our lives and the more I tried like an ass to help the more I seemed to mess things up till the crash came and we all went to bits together And we had to give up the only work we liked and I did love mine so and slave at things we hated And still we kept sinking and sinking and crashing on worse and worse rocks till we hadn t a sound piece left to float us And then when I thought at least we could go down together they went away and left me behind So I d failed there too hopelessly I always have failed in everything I ve tried I tried to make Rhoda happy but that failed too She left me and now she s dead and Thomas hasn t any mother at all And Lucy whom I d cared for since before I could remember and I d always thought without thinking about it that some day of course we should be together Lucy left me and our caring became wrong so that at last we didn t care to see one another at all And then it was as if hell had opened and let us in The other things hadn t counted like that health money beautiful things interesting work honour friends marriage even Denis they d all collapsed and I did mind horribly But not like that As long as I could see Lucy sometimes I could go on and I had Thomas too though I don t know why he hasn t collapsed yet But at last quite suddenly when the emptiness and the losing had been getting to seem worse and worse for a long time they became so bad that they were impossible I got angry it was for Thomas more than for myself I think and I said it should end I said I would take things steal them if I couldn t get them by fair means And I went down to Astleys to see them to tell them it must end And in the woods I met Lucy And she d been getting to know too that it must end for her sake as well as for mine And so we re going to end it and begin again We re going to be happy because life is too jolly to miss Peter ended defiantly and flung his razor in among the socks Rodney had listened quietly his eyes on Peter s profile When he stayed silent Peter supposed that he had at last convinced him of the unbreakable strength of his purpose for iniquity and that he would give him up and go away After a minute he turned and looked up at Rodney and said Now do you see that it s no good Rodney took out his pipe and knocked it out and put it away before he answered I m glad you ve said all that Peter Not that I didn t know it all before of course I did When I said at first that I didn t understand you I was lying I did understand perfectly well But I m glad you ve said it because it s well to know that you realise it so clearly yourself It saves my explaining it to you It gives us a common knowledge to start on And now may I talk for a little please No not for a little for some time Go on said Peter But it s no use you know What do you mean by our common knowledge The knowledge that I m a failure Rodney nodded Precisely that You ve stated the case so clearly yourself in outline for you ve left out a great deal of course that really it doesn t leave much for me to say Let s leave you alone for the moment I want to talk about other people There are other people in the world besides ourselves of course improbable as the fact occasionally seems The fact I mean that it s a world not of individual units but of closely connected masses of people not one of whom stands alone One can t detach oneself one s got to be in with one camp or another The world s full of different and opposing camps worse luck There are the beauty lovers and the beauty scorners and all the fluctuating masses in between like most of us who love some aspects of it and scorn others There are the well meaning and the ill meaning and again the incoherent cross benchers who mean a little good and a little harm and for the most part mean nothing at all either way Again there are what people call the well bred the ill bred and of course the half bred An idiotic division that because what do we know any of us of breeding that we should call it good or bad But there it is a most well marked division in everyone s eyes And and now I m getting to the point there are the rich and the poor or call them rather the Haves and the Have nots I don t mean with regard to money particularly though that comes in But it s an all round thing It s an undoubted fact and one there s no getting round that some people are born with the acquiring faculty and others with the losing Most of us of course are in the half way house and win and lose in fairly average proportions But some of us seem marked out either for the one or for the other I know personally a good many in both camps Many more of the Have nots though because I prefer to cultivate their acquaintance There s a great deal to be done for the Haves too they need I fancy all the assistance they can get if they re not to become prosperity rotten The Have Nots haven t that danger but they ve plenty of dangers of their own and well I suppose it s a question of taste and that I prefer them Anyhow I do know a great many People you understand with nothing at all that seems to make life tolerable Destitutes incapables outcasts slaves to their own lusts or to a grinding economic system or to some other cruelty of fate or men Whatever the immediate cause of their ill fortune may be its underlying fundamental cause is their own inherent faculty for failure and loss their incompetence to take and hold the good things of life You know the stale old hackneyed cry of the anti socialists how it would be no use equalising conditions because each man would soon return again to his original state It s true in a deeper sense than they mean You might equalise economic conditions as much as you please but you d never equalise fundamental conditions you d never turn the poor into the rich the Have Nots into the Haves You know I m not a Socialist I don t want to see a futile attempt to throw down barriers and merge all camps in one indeterminate army who don t know what they mean or where they re going I m not a Socialist because I don t believe in a universal outward prosperity I mean I don t want it I should have no use for it I m holding no brief for the rich I ve nothing to say about them just now and anyhow you and I have no concern with them Rodney pulled himself back from the edge of a topic on which he was apt to become readily vehement But Socialism isn t the way out for them any more than it s the way out for the poor it s got I believe to be by individual renunciation that their salvation will come by their giving up and stripping bare and going down one by one and empty handed into the common highways to take their share of hardness like men It will be extraordinarily difficult Changing one s camp is It s so difficult as to be all but impossible Perhaps you ve read the Bible story of the young man with great possessions and how it was said With men it is impossible Well the tradition true or false goes that in the end he did it gave up his possessions and became financially poor But we don t know even if that s true what else he kept of his wealth a good deal I daresay that wasn t money or material goods One can t tell What we do know is that to cross that dividing line to change one s camp is a nearly impossible thing Someone says That division the division of those who have and those who have not runs so deep as almost to run to the bottom The great division he calls it between those who seize and those who lose Well the Haves aren t always seizers I think often more often perhaps they have only to move tranquilly through life and let gifts drop into their hands It s pleasant to see if we are not in a mood to be jarred It s often attractive It was mainly that that attracted you long ago in Denis Urquhart The need and the want in you who got little and lost much was somehow vicariously satisfied by the gifts he received from fortune by his beauty and strength and good luck and power of winning and keeping He was pleasant in your eyes because of these gifts of his and indeed they made of him a pleasant person since he had nothing to be unpleasant about So your emptiness found pleasure in his fullness your poverty in his riches your weakness in his strength and you loved him And I think if anything could yet have redeemed him have saved him from his prosperity it would have been your love But instead of letting it drag him down into the scrum and the pity and the battle of life he turned away from it and kept it at a distance and shut himself more closely between his protecting walls of luxury and well being Then again Lucy gave him his chance but he hasn t so far followed her love either She d have led him if she could out of the protecting confining walls into the open where people are struggling and perishing for lack of a little pity but he wouldn t So far the time hasn t been ripe for his saving his day is still to come It s up to all of us who care for him and can any of us help it to save him from himself And chiefly it s your job and Lucy s You can do your part now only by clearing out of the way and leaving Lucy to do hers She will do it I firmly believe in the end if you give her time Lucy I know for I have seen it when I have been with her has been troubled about her own removal from the arena about her own being confined between walls so that she can t hear the people outside calling but that is mere egotism She can hear and see all right she has all her senses and she will never stop using them It s her business to be concerned for Denis who is blind and deaf It s her business to use her own caring to make him care She s got to drag him out not to let herself be shut inside with him It can be done and Lucy if anyone in the world can do it if she doesn t give up and shirk Lucy if anyone in the world has the right touch the right loosing power to set Denis free I think that you too have the touch and the power but you mustn t use yours the time for that is gone by Yours is the much harder business of clearing out of the way If you ever loved Denis you will do that He paused and looked at Peter who was still sitting on the floor motionless with bent head May I go on said Rodney and Peter answered nothing Rodney looked away again out of the window into a grey night sky that hid the Easter moon and went on gently He was tired of talking his discourse had been already nearly as long as an average woman but he went on deliberately talking and talking to give Peter time So you see that is an excellent reason to you it is I believe the incontrovertible reason why you should once more give up and lose and not take But deeper than that to me more insurmountable than that is the true reason which is simply that that very thing to lose to do without is your business in life as you ve said yourself It s your profession You are in the camp of the Have Nots you belong there You can t desert You can t step out and go over to the enemy If you did if you could only you can t it would be a betrayal And whatever you gained you d lose by it what you have at present your fellowship with the other unfortunates Isn t that a thing worth having Isn t it something to be down on the ground with the poor and empty handed not above them where you can t hear them crying and laughing Would you if you could be one of the prosperous who don t care Would you if you could be one of those who have their joy in life ready made and put into their hands instead of one of the poor craftsmen who have to make their own What s the gaiety of the saints Not the pleasant cheerfulness of the Denis Urquharts and their kind who have things but the gaiety in the teeth of circumstances of St Francis and his paupers who have nothing and yet possess all things That s your gaiety the gaiety that plays the fool as you put it looking into the very eyes of agony and death that loses and laughs and makes others laugh in the last ditch the gaiety of those who drop all cargoes fortune and good name and love overboard lightly and still spread sail to the winds and voyage and when they re driven by the winds at last onto a lee shore derelicts clinging to a broken wreck find on the shore coloured shells to play with and still are gay That s your gaiety as I ve always known it and loved it Are you going to chuck that gaiety away and rise up full of the lust to possess and take and grasp and plunder Are you going to desert the empty handed legion whose van you ve marched in all your life and join the prosperous Rodney broke off for a moment as if he waited for an answer He rose from his chair and began to walk about the room speaking again with a more alright vehemence Oh you may think this is mere romance fancy sentiment what you will But it isn t It s deadly solid truth You can t grasp You can t try to change your camp You and Lucy too for she s in the same camp wouldn t be happy to put it at its simplest You d know all the time that you d shirked deserted been false to your business You d be fishes out of water with the knowledge that you d taken for your own pleasure something that someone else ought to have had It isn t in either of you to do it You must leave such work to the Haves Why what happens the first time you try it on You have to send back the goods you ve tried to appropriate to where they came from It would be the same always You don t know how to possess Then in heaven s name leave possessing alone and stick to the job you are good at doing without For you are good at that You always have been except just for just one short interlude which will pass like an illness and leave you well again Believe me it will I don t know when or how soon but I do know that sometime you will be happy again with the things the coloured shells so to speak that you find still when all the winds and storms have done their worst and all your cargoes are broken wrecks at your feet It will be then in that last emptiness that you ll come to terms with disaster and play the fool again to amuse yourself and the other derelicts because when there s nothing else left there s always laughter Rodney had walked to the window and now stood looking out at the dim luminous night wherein shrouded the Easter moon dwelt in the heart of shadows From many churches many clocks chimed the hour Rodney spoke once more slowly leaning out into the shadowy night Through this week he said they have been watching in those churches a supreme renouncement the ultimate agony of giving up the last triumph of utter loss I m not going to talk about that it s not my business or my right But it surely counts that giving up whatever we may or may not believe about it It shines a terrible counsel of perfection for those who have burning and hurting But for those who have not it doesn t burn and hurt it shines to cheer and comfort it is the banner of the leader of the losing legion lifted up that the rest may follow after Does that help at all Perhaps at this moment nothing helps at all Have I said enough Need I go on Peter s voice flat and dead spoke out of the shadow of the dim room You have said enough You need not go on Then Rodney turned and saw him sitting still on the floor by the half packed bag with the yellow dog sleeping against him In the dim light his face looked pale and pinched like a dead man s You ve done your work the flat voice said You ve taken it away the new life we so wanted You ve shown that it can t be You re quite right And you re right too that nothing helps at all Because of Denis I can t do this But I find no good in emptiness why should I I want to have things and enjoy them at this moment more desperately than you who praise emptiness and doing without ever wanted anything I am aware of that said Rodney You ve got in the way said Peter looking up at the tall gaunt figure by the window and anger shook him You ve stepped in and spoilt it all Yes you needn t be afraid you ve spoilt it quite irrevocably You knew that to mention Denis was enough to do that I was trying to forget him I could have till it was too late You can go home now and feel quite easy you ve done your job There s to be no new life for me or Thomas or Lucy or Francesco only the same old emptiness The same old oh damn Peter who never swore that ugly violence being repugnant to his nature swore now and woke Francesco who put up his head to lick his friend s face But Peter pushed him away surprising him violently and caught at his half filled bag and snatched at the contents and flung them on the top of one another on the floor They lay in a jumbled chaos Thomas s clothes and Peter s socks and razor and Thomas s rabbit and Peter s books and Francesco snuffled among them and tossed them about thinking it a new game Go away now Peter flung out the words like another oath Go away to your poverty which you like and leave us to ours which we hate There s no more left for you to take away from us it s all gone Unless you d like me to throw Thomas out of the window since you think breakages are so good Rodney merely said I m not going away just yet Could you let me stay here for the night and sleep on the sofa It s late to go back to night Sleep where you like said Peter There s the bed I don t want it But Rodney stretched himself instead on the horse hair sofa He said no more knowing that the time for words was past He lay tired and quiet with closed eyes knowing how Peter and the other disreputable forsaken outcast sat together huddled on the floor through the dim night till the dawn looked palely in and showed them both fallen asleep Peter s head resting on Francesco s yellow back It was Rodney who got up stiffly from his hard resting place in the dark unlovely morning and made tea over Peter s spirit lamp for both of them Peter woke later and drank it mechanically Then he looked at Rodney and said I m horribly stiff Why did neither of us go to bed He was pale and heavy eyed and violent no more but very quiet and tired as if accepting he was sinking deep in grey and cold seas that numbed resistance and drowned words The milk came in and Peter gave Thomas to drink and on the heels of the milk came the post and a letter for Peter I suppose said Peter dully as he opened it she too has found out that it can t be done The letter said Peter we can t do it I am horribly horribly sorry but I know it now for certain Perhaps you know it too by now Because the reason is in you not in me It is that you love Denis too much So you couldn t be happy I want you to be happy more than I want anything in the world but it can t be this way Please dear Peter be happy sometime please please be happy I love you always if that helps at all Lucy Peter let the note fall on the floor and stood with bent head by the side of Thomas s crib while Thomas guggled his milk Two minds with but a single thought he remarked in that new dreary voice of his As always Well it saves trouble And we re utterly safe now you see doubly safe You can go home in peace Then Rodney knowing that he could be no more use left the three derelicts together lighting n The gas lamp gradually lost ground to electric lighting The
