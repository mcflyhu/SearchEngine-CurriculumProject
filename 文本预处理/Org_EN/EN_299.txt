The th day of August about two in the afternoon I David Balfour came forth of the British Linen Company a porter attending me with a bag of money and some of the chief of these merchants bowing me from their doors Two days before and even so late as yestermorning I was like a beggarman by the wayside clad in rags brought down to my last shillings my companion a condemned traitor a price set on my own head for a crime with the news of which the country rang To day I was served heir to my position in life a landed laird a bank porter by me carrying my gold recommendations in my pocket and in the words of the saying the ball directly at my foot There were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much sail The first was the very difficult [pg ]and deadly business I had still to handle the second the place that I was in The tall black city and the numbers and movement and noise of so many folk made a new world for me after the moorland braes the sea sands and the still country sides that I had frequented up to then The throng of the citizens in particular abashed me Rankeillor s son was short and small in the girth his clothes scarce held on me and it was plain I was ill qualified to strut in the front of a bank porter It was plain if I did so I should but set folk laughing and what was worse in my case set them asking questions So that I behooved to come by some clothes of my own and in the meanwhile to walk by the porter s side and put my hand on his arm as though we were a pair of friends At a merchant s in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out none too fine for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback but comely and responsible so that servants should respect me Thence to an armourer s where I got a plain sword to suit with my degree in life I felt safer with the weapon though for one so ignorant of defence it might be called an added danger The porter who was naturally a man of some experience judged my accoutrement to be well chosen Naething kenspeckle [ ] said he plain dacent claes As for the rapier nae doubt it sits wi your [pg ]degree but an I had been you I would hae waired my siller better gates than that And proposed I should buy winter hosen from a wife in the Cowgate back that was a cousin of his own and made them extraordinar endurable But I had other matters on my hand more pressing Here I was in this old black city which was for all the world like a rabbit warren not only by the number of its indwellers but the complication of its passages and holes It was indeed a place where no stranger had a chance to find a friend let be another stranger Suppose him even to hit on the right close people dwelt so thronged in these tall houses he might very well seek a day before he chanced on the right door The ordinary course was to hire a lad they called a caddie who was like a guide or pilot led you where you had occasion and your errands being done brought you again where you were lodging But these caddies being always employed in the same sort of services and having it for obligation to be well informed of every house and person in the city had grown to form a brotherhood of spies and I knew from tales of Mr Campbell s how they communicated one with another what a rage of curiosity they conceived as to their employer s business and how they were like eyes and fingers to the police It would be a piece of little wisdom the way I was now placed to tack such a ferret to my tails I had three visits to make all immediately needful to my kinsman Mr [pg ]Balfour of Pilrig to Stewart the Writer that was Appin s agent and to William Grant Esquire of Prestongrange Lord Advocate of Scotland Mr Balfour s was a non committal visit and besides Pilrig being in the country I made bold to find way to it myself with the help of my two legs and a Scots tongue But the rest were in a different case Not only was the visit to Appin s agent in the midst of the cry about the Appin murder dangerous in itself but it was highly inconsistent with the other I was like to have a bad enough time of it with my Lord Advocate Grant the best of ways but to go to him hot foot from Appin s agent was little likely to mend my own affairs and might prove the mere ruin of friend Alan s The whole thing besides gave me a look of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds that was little to my fancy I determined therefore to be done at once with Mr Stewart and the whole Jacobitical side of my business and to profit for that purpose by the guidance of the porter at my side But it chanced I had scarce given him the address when there came a sprinkle of rain nothing to hurt only for my new clothes and we took shelter under a pend at the head of a close or alley Being strange to what I saw I stepped a little farther in The narrow paved way descended swiftly Prodigious tall houses sprang upon each side and bulged out one story beyond another as they rose At the top [pg ]only a ribbon of sky showed in By what I could spy in the windows and by the respectable persons that passed out and in I saw the houses to be very well occupied and the whole appearance of the place interested me like a tale I was still gazing when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet in time and clash of steel behind me Turning quickly I was aware of a party of armed soldiers and in their midst a tall man in a great coat He walked with a stoop that was like a piece of courtesy genteel and insinuating he waved his hands plausibly as he went and his face was sly and handsome I thought his eye took me in but could not meet it This procession went by to a door in the close which a serving man in a fine livery set open and two of the soldier lads carried the prisoner within the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door There can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some following of idle folk and children It was so now but the more part melted away incontinent until but three were left One was a girl she was dressed like a lady and had a screen of the Drummond colours on her head but her comrades or I should say followers were ragged gillies such as I had seen the matches of by the dozen in my Highland journey They all spoke together earnestly in Gaelic the sound of which was pleasant in my ears for the sake of Alan and though the rain was by again and my porter [pg ]plucked at me to be going I even drew nearer where they were to listen The lady scolded sharply the others making apologies and cringeing before her so that I made sure she was come of a chief s house All the while the three of them sought in their pockets and by what I could make out they had the matter of half a farthing among the party which made me smile a little to see all Highland folk alike for fine obeisances and empty sporrans It chanced the girl turned suddenly about so that I saw her face for the first time There is no greater wonder than the way the face of a young woman fits in a man s mind and stays there and he could never tell you why it just seems it was the thing he wanted She had wonderful bright eyes like stars and I daresay the eyes had a part in it but what I remember the most clearly was the way her lips were a trifle open as she turned And whatever was the cause I stood there staring like a fool On her side as she had not known there was anyone so near she looked at me a little longer and perhaps with more surprise than was entirely civil It went through my country head she might be wondering at my new clothes with that I blushed to my hair and at the sight of my colouring it s to be supposed she drew her own conclusions for she moved her gillies farther down the close and they fell again to this dispute where I could hear no more of it [pg ]I had often admired a lassie before then if scarce so sudden and strong and it was rather my disposition to withdraw than to come forward for I was much in fear of mockery from the womenkind You would have thought I had now all the more reason to pursue my common practice since I had met this young lady in the city street seemingly following a prisoner and accompanied with two very ragged indecent like Highlandmen But there was here a different ingredient it was plain the girl thought I had been prying in her secrets and with my new clothes and sword and at the top of my new fortunes this was more than I could swallow The beggar on horseback could not bear to be thrust down so low or at the least of it not by this young lady I followed accordingly and took off my new hat to her the best that I was able Madam said I I think it only fair to myself to let you understand I have no Gaelic It is true I was listening for I have friends of my own across the Highland line and the sound of that tongue comes friendly but for your private affairs if you had spoken Greek I might have had more guess at them She made me a little distant curtsey There is no harm done said she with a pretty accent most like the English but more agreeable A cat may look at a king I do not mean to offend said I I have no skill of city manners I never before this day set foot inside the doors of Edinburgh Take me for a country lad it s what I am and I would rather I told you than you found it out Indeed it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be speaking to each other on the causeway she replied But if you are landward[ ] bred it will be different I am as landward as yourself I am Highland as you see and think myself the farther from my home It is not yet a week since I passed the line said I Less than a week ago I was on the Braes of Balwhidder Balwhither she cries come ye from Balwhither The name of it makes all there is of me rejoice You will not have been long there and not known some of our friends or family I lived with a very honest kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren I replied Well I know Duncan and you give him the true name she said and if he is an honest man his wife is honest indeed Ay said I they are fine people and the place is a bonny place Where in the great world is such another she cries I am loving the smell of that place and the roots that grew there I was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid I could be wishing I had brought you a spray of that heather says I And though I did ill to speak with you at the first now it seems we have common acquaintance I make it my petition you will not forget me David Balfour is the name I am known by This is my lucky day when I have just come into a landed estate and am not very long out of a deadly peril I wish you would keep my name in mind for the sake of Balquidder said I and I will yours for the sake of my lucky day My name is not spoken she replied with a great deal of haughtiness More than a hundred years it has not gone upon men s tongues save for a blink I am nameless like the Folk of Peace [ ] Catriona Drummond is the one I use Now indeed I knew where I was standing In all broad Scotland there was but the one name proscribed and that was the name of the Macgregors Yet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy I plunged the deeper in I have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself said I and I think he will be one of your friends They called him Robin Oig Did ye so cries she Ye met Rob I passed the night with him said I He is a fowl of the night said she There was a set of pipes there I went on so you may judge if the time passed You should be no enemy at all events said she That was his brother there a moment since with the red soldiers round him It is him that I call father Is it so cried I Are you a daughter of James More s All the daughter that he has says she the daughter of a prisoner that I should forget it so even for one hour to talk with strangers Here one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of English to know what she meaning by that himself was to do about ta sneeshin I took some note of him for a short bandy legged red haired big headed man that I was to know more of to my cost There can be none the day Neil she replied How will you get sneeshin wanting siller It will teach you another time to be more careful and I think James More will not be very well pleased with Neil of the Tom Miss Drummond I said I told you I was in my lucky day Here I am and a bank porter at my tail And remember I have had the hospitality of your own country of Balwhidder It was not one of my people gave it said she Ah well said I but I am owing your uncle at least for some springs upon the pipes Besides which I have offered myself to be your friend and you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse me in the proper time If it had been a great sum it might have done you honour said she But I will tell you what this is James More lies shackled in prison but this time past they will be bringing him down here daily to the Advocate s The Advocate s I cried Is that It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange said she There they bring my father one time and another for what purpose I have no thought in my mind but it seems there is some hope dawned for him All this same time they will not let me be seeing him nor yet him write and we wait upon the King s street to catch him and now we give him his snuff as he goes by and now something else And here is this son of trouble Neil son of Duncan has lost my fourpenny piece that was to buy that snuff and James More must go wanting and will think his daughter has forgotten him I took sixpence from my pocket gave it to Neil and bade him go about his errand Then to her That sixpence came with me by Balwhidder said I Ah she said you are a friend to the Gregara I would not like to deceive you either said I I know very little of the Gregara and less of James More and his doings but since the while I have been standing in this close I seem to know something of yourself and if you will just say a friend to Miss Catriona I will see you are the less cheated The one cannot be without the other said she I will even try said I And what will you be thinking of myself she cried to be holding my hand to the first stranger I am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter said I I must not be without repaying it she said where is it you stop To tell the truth I am stopping nowhere yet said I being not full three hours in the city but if you will give me your direction I will be so bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself Will I can trust you for that she asked You have little fear said I James More could not bear it else said she I stop beyond the village of Dean on the north side of the water with Mrs Drummond Ogilvy of Allardyce who is my near friend and will be glad to thank you You are to see me then so soon as what I have to do permits said I and the remembrance of Alan rolling in again upon my mind I made haste to say farewell I could not but think even as I did so that we had made extraordinary free upon short acquaintance and that a really wise young lady would have shown herself [pg ]more backward I think it was the bank porter that put me from this ungallant train of thought I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o sense he began shooting out his lips Ye re no likely to gang far this gate A fule and his siller s shune parted Eh but ye re a green callant he cried an a veecious tae
