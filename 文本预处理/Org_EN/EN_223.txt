One day when my head was clearer I seemed to have lain a great while waiting for someone to come I asked where Mrs Harborough was She was engaged for the moment Presently I asked what kept her The nurse rang and sent a message Mrs Harborough came up at once She had been talking to Mr Annan she said And would I like to see him No I shrank under the bedclothes and turned my face to the wall An afternoon soon after that brought me the sudden clear sense of Eric s being again in the house I was sure that he timed his visits so that he might see the doctor When the doctor left the room that afternoon I asked if Mr Annan had been again Yes and did I want to see him now No He has come to day with another friend of yours said Mrs Harborough lingering [Pg ] One of the Helmstones I asked dully No Mr Dallas Ranny Ranny was downstairs The happy care free people were going still about the world Is he married I asked Married Mrs Harborough seemed surprised Certainly he seemed free to devote a great deal of time to us Mr Annan and he between them had left no means untried she said I have been told a thousand times I interrupted that everything has been done but no one ever tells me what I fell to crying Looking more stirred than I had ever thought to see her she told me that young Dallas had offered rewards and had gone from place to place in search I seized her hands I made her sit by the bedside Yes and always he had come back here making his report and asking questions Eric brought the doctors and the nurses but Ranny had done better Ranny had stirred up Scotland Yard When Eric told him the nurse had said I was for ever raving about barred windows [Pg ] Ranny had flung out of my aunt s drawing room and was gone a day and a night Yes he came back He had found the house He got a warrant and he went with the police when they made their search He had seen the woman She brazened it out She had never heard of either Bettina or me My story Oh very possible she said that I and my sister had been seeing life No uncommon thing for young women to lie about their escapades Drugged the usual excuse The next day I asked them to let me see Ranny They refused I did not sleep that night The doctor came earlier the next morning and was troubled What is it he said I told him I will promise to be very quiet I said I would promise anything if they would only let me see Ranny Mrs Harborough went out and sent a message Mr Dallas was staying quite near she said But I waited for him for a thousand years And then a footstep on the stair My heart drew quivering back from the two edged knife of Wanting to know and Dreading to know [Pg ] Then all that poignancy of feeling fell to dulness for the step was not Ranny s and not Eric s I had never heard this slow uncertain footfall The door opened and it was Ranny He did not look at me His eyes went circling low like swallows before rain They settled on the coverlid till slowly he had come and stood beside me Then Ranny lifted his eyes Oh poor eyes Poor soul looking out of them Ranny I whispered speak to me I have failed he said He leaned heavily against the chair I have heard I managed to say how hard you have been trying But I have failed he said once more and I hope I may never again hear such an accent I pointed to the chair we could neither of us speak for a while And then he cleared his throat They took her out of that house and hid her he said And then they took her abroad I[Pg ] traced her to their house in Paris But she had gone Always I have been too late When I could speak I said You are a good friend Ranny He made an impatient gesture Nothing is any good He stood up But I wanted you to know that I am trying Trying still Nothing that you could do but I am doing it Will you believe that But Ranny I said how can you do all this Haven t you other claims Other claims he said as though he had never heard of them You surely did have other claims I thought I had But when this came I saw they were nothing He stopped an instant near the door You don t believe I would lie to you No I said Then get well You have something to live for You and Annan Not like me He went out with that strange
