The boarding house suddenly ceased to be Its long illness ended in natural death There was a growing feeling among the boarders that no self respecting person could remain with people whose financial affairs were in the precarious condition of the Margerisons people who couldn t pay the butcher and lived on ill founded expectations of subsidies As two years ago the Margerisons had been thrown roughly out of the profession of artistic experts so now the doors of the boarding house world were shut upon them Boarders are like that intensely respectable All the loosed dogs of ill fortune seemed to be yelping at the Margerisons heels at once Hilary when he recovered from his influenza and went out to look for jobs couldn t find one Again and again he was curtly refused employment by editors and others Every night he came home a little more bitter than the day before Peter too while he lay mending of his breakages received a letter from the place of business he adorned informing him that it would not trouble him further He had never been much use to it he had been taken on at Leslie s request and given a trial but it could not last for ever as Peter fair mindedly admitted Well he commented I suppose one must do something else eventually But I shall put off reflecting on that till I can move about more easily Hilary said We are being hounded out of London as we were hounded out of Venice It is unbearable What remains Nothing that I can see at the moment said Peter laughing weakly Ireland said Peggy suddenly Let s go there Dublin s worth a dozen of this hideous old black dirty place You could get work on The Nationalist Hilary I do believe for the sub editorship s just been given to my cousin Larry Callaghan Come along to the poor old country and we ll try our luck again Dublin I believe to be an unspeakable place to live in said Hilary but mainly from habit Still I presume one must live somewhere so He turned to Peter Where shall you and Thomas live Peter flushed slightly He had supposed that he and Thomas were also to live in the unspeakable Dublin Oh we haven t quite made up our minds I must consult Thomas about it But broke in Peggy of course you re coming with us my dear What do you mean You re not surely going to desert us now Peter Peter glanced at Hilary Hilary said pushing his hair with his restless gesture from his forehead Really Peggy we can t drag Peter about after us all our lives it s hardly fair on him to involve him in all our disasters when he has more than enough of his own Indeed and he has Peter s mischancier than you are Hilary on the whole and I will not leave him and Tommy to get lost or broken by themselves Don t be so silly Peter of course you re coming with us I think said Peter that Thomas and I will perhaps stay in London You see I can t probably get work on The Nationalist and it s doubtful what I could do in Dublin I suppose I can get work of a sort in London enough to provide Thomas with milk though possibly not all from one cow I daresay And who d look after the mite I d like to know while you re earning his milk Oh the landlady I should think Everyone likes Thomas he s remarkably popular Afterwards Hilary said to Peggy Really Peggy I see no reason why Peter should be dragged about with us in the future The joint m nage has not in the past been such a success that we need want to perpetuate it In fact though of course it is pleasant to have Peter in the house Indeed it is the darling put in Peggy One can t deny that disasters have come upon us extraordinarily fast since he came to live with us in Venice two years ago First he discovered things that annoyed him in my private affairs which was extremely disagreeable for all of us and really he was rather unnecessarily officious about that in fact I consider that it was owing largely to the line he took that things reached their final very trying d nouement Since then disaster upon disaster has come upon us Peter s unfortunate marriage and consequent serious expenses including the child now left upon his hands really you know that was an exceedingly stupid step that Peter took I tried to dissuade him at the time but of course it was no use And he is so very frequently ill so am I you will say Peggy didn t because Hilary wasn t as a matter of fact ill quite so often as he believed but two crocks in a household are twice as inconvenient as one And now there has been this unpleasant jar with the Urquharts Peter by his rudeness to them has finally severed the connection and we can hope for nothing from that quarter in future And I am not sure that I choose to have living with me a much younger brother who has influential friends of his own in whom he insists that we shall have neither part nor lot I strongly object to the way Peter spoke to us on that occasion it was extremely offensive Oh don t be such a goose Hilary The boy only lost his temper for a moment and I m sure that happens seldom enough And as to the rest of it I don t like the way you speak of him as if he was the cause of our mischances and as if his being so mischancey himself wasn t a reason why we should all stick together and him with that scrap of a child too though I will say Peter s a handier creature with a child than anyone would think I suppose it s the practice he s had handling other costly things that break easy Well have it your own way Hilary Only mind if Peter wants to come with us he surely shall I m not going to leave him behind like a left kitten And I d love to have him for he makes sunshine in the house when things are blackest Lately Peter has appeared to me to be rather depressed said Hilary and Peggy too had perceived that this was so It was something so new in Peter that it called for notice There was needed no further dispute between Peggy and Hilary for Peter said that he and Thomas preferred to stay in London I can probably find a job of some sort to keep us I might with luck get a place as shop walker That always looks a glorious life You merely walk about and say Yes madam This way for hose madam Something to live on and nothing to do as the poet says But I expect they are difficult places to get without previous experience Short of that I could be one of the men round stations that open people s cab doors and take the luggage out or even a bus conductor who knows Oh there are lots of openings But in Dublin I feel my talents might be lost Thomas and I will move into more modest apartments and go in for plain living and high thinking You poor little dears said Peggy and kissed both of them Well it ll be plain living for the lot of us that s obvious and lucky too to get that I d love to have you two children with us but But Peter to whom other people s minds were as books that who runs may read had no intention of coming with them That faculty of intuition of Peter s had drawbacks as well as advantages He knew as well as if Hilary had said so that Hilary considered their life together a disastrous series of mishaps largely owing to Peter and that he did not desire to continue it He knew precisely what was Denis Urquhart s point of view and state of feelings towards himself and his family and how unbridgeable that gulf was He knew why Lucy was stopping away and would stop away for if other people s thoughts were to him as pebbles in running water hers were pebbles seen white and lucid in a still clear pool And he knew very well that he relieved Peggy s kind heart when he said he and Thomas would stop in London for to Peggy anything was better than to worry her poor old Hilary more than need be So before March was out about St Cuthbert s day in fact Hilary Margerison and his family left England for a more distressful country to seek their fortunes fresh and Peter and his family sought modest apartments in a little street behind St Austin s Church where the apartments are very modest indeed Are they too modest for you Thomas Peter asked dubiously And do you too much hate the Girl The Girl was the landlady s daughter and undertook for a small consideration to look after Thomas while Peter was out and feed him at suitable intervals Thomas and Peter did rather hate her for she was a slatternly girl matching her mother and her mother s apartments and didn t always take her curlers off till the evening and said Boo to Thomas merely because he was young a detestable habit Peter and Thomas considered Peter had to make a great deal of sensible conversation to Thomas to make up I m sorry Peter apologised but you see Thomas it s all we can afford You don t earn anything at all and I only earn a pound a week which is barely enough to keep you in drink I don t deserve even that for I don t address envelopes well but I suppose they know it s such a detestable job that they haven t the face to give me less Peter was addressing envelopes because a Robinson relative had given him the job and he hadn t the nerve to refuse it He couldn t well refuse it because of Thomas Uncompanioned by Thomas he would probably have chosen instead to sweep a crossing or play a barrel organ or stand at a street corner with outstretched hat though this last would only have done for a summer engagement as Peter didn t like the winds that play round street corners in winter But Thomas was very much there and had to be provided for so Peter copied letters and addressed envelopes and earned twenty shillings weekly and out of it paid for Thomas s drink and Thomas s Girl and his own food and beds and a sitting room and fires and laundry for both and occasional luxuries in the way of wooden animals for Thomas to play with So they were not extremely poor they were respectably well to do For Thomas s sake Peter supposed it was worth while not to be extremely poor even though it meant addressing envelopes and living in a great grey prison house of a city where one only surmised the first early pushings of the spring beyond the encompassing gloom Peter used to tell Thomas about that in order that he might know something of the joyous world beyond the walls He told Thomas in March taking time by the forelock about the early violets that were going some time to open blue eyes in the ditches by the roads where the spring winds walk about the blackthorn that would suddenly make a white glory of the woods about the green sticky budding of the larches and the keen sweet smell of them and the damp fragrance of the roaming wind that would blow over river flooded fields smelling of bonfires and wet earth He took him through the seasons telling him of the blown golden armies of the daffodils that marched out for Easter and the fragrant white glory of the may and the pale pink stars of the hedge roses and the yellow joy of buttercup fields wherein cows stand knee deep and munch in order to give Thomas sweet white milk Ugh said Thomas making a face and Peter answered Yes I know sometimes they come upon an onion flower and eat that and that s not nice of course But mostly it s grass and buttercups and clover Then he told him of hot July roads where the soft white dust lies while the horses and the cows stand up to their middles in cool streams beneath the willows and switch their tails and the earth dreams through the year s hot noon and of August the world s welfare and the earth s warming pan and how in the fayre rivers swimming is a sweet exercise And my birthday comes then Oh tis the merry time wherein honest neighbours make good cheer and God is glorified in his blessings on the earth Then cometh September Thomas Peter was half talking half reading out of a book he had got to amuse Thomas then cometh September and then he that s you Thomas doth freshly beginne to garnish his house and make provision of needfull things for to live in winter which draweth very nere There are a few nice things in September ripe plums and pears and nuts no nuts aren t nice because our teeth aren t good are they at least mine aren t and you ve only got one and a half but anyhow plums and a certain amount of yellow sunshine and Thomas s birthday But on the whole it s too near the end of things and in briefe I thus conclude of it I hold it the Winter s forewarning and the Summer s farewell Adieu We won t pursue the year further my dear the rest is silence and impenetrable gloom anyhow in this corner of the world and doesn t bear thinking about Thus did Peter talk to Thomas of an evening when they sat together after tea over the fire Sometimes he told him news of the world of men One evening he said to him very gently and pitifully Dear old man your mother s dead For her sake one s glad I suppose You and I must try to look at it from her point of view She s escaped from a poor business Some day I ll read you the letter she wrote to you and me as she lay dying but not yet for I never read you sad things do I But some day you may be glad to know that she had thoughts for you at the last She was sorry she left us Thomas horribly dreadfully sorry I wish she hadn t been I wish she could have gone on being happy till the end It was my fault that she did it and it didn t even make her happy And I suppose it killed her at the last or would she anyhow have escaped that way before long But I took more care of her than he did And now she ll never come back to us I ve thought sometimes Thomas that perhaps she would that perhaps she would get tired of him so tired that she would leave him and come back to us and then you d have had a mother to do for you instead of only me and the Girl Poor little Thomas you ll never have a mother now I m sorry sorry sorry about it Sorry for you and sorry for her and sorry for all of us It s a pitiful world Thomas it seems I wonder how you re going to get through it Never before had he talked to Thomas like that He had been used to speak to him of new burnisht joys and a world of treasure But of late Peter had been conscious of increasing effort in being cheerful before Thomas It was as if the little too much that breaks had been laid upon him and under it he was breaking For the first time he was seeing the world not as a glorious treasure place full of glad things for touch and sight and hearing full of delightful people and absurd jokes but as a grey and lonely sea through which one drifted rudderless towards a lee shore He supposed that there was somewhere a lee shore a place where the winds having blown their uttermost ceased to blow and where wrecked things were cast up at last broken beyond all mending and beyond all struggling to find the peace of the utterly lost He had not got there yet he and his broken boat were struggling in the grey cold waters which had swept all his cargo from him bale by bale From him that hath not shall indeed be taken away even that which he hath It was Thomas who caused Peter to think of these things newly Thomas who was starting life with so poor a heritage For Thomas so like himself Peter foresaw the same progressive wreckage Thomas too having already lost a mother would lose later all he loved he would give to some friend all he was and had and the friend would drop him in the mud and leave him there and the cold bitterness as of death would go over Thomas s head He would perhaps love a woman too and the woman would leave him quite alone not coming near him in his desolation because he loved her He would also lose his honour his profession and the beautiful things he loved to handle and play with And then when you ve lost everything and perhaps been involved in some of my disgraces you ll think that at least you and I can stick together and go under together and help each other a little And I daresay you ll find that I shall say No I m going off to Ireland or Italy or somewhere I ve had enough of you and you can jolly well sink or swim by yourself so you see you won t have even me to live for in the end just when you want me most That s the sort of thing that happens Oh what chance have you said Peter very bitterly huddled elbows on knees over the chilly fire while Thomas slumbered in a shawl on the rug Bitterness was so strange in Peter so odd and new that Thomas was disturbed by it and woke and wailed as if his world was tumbling about his ears Peter too felt it strange and new and laughed a little at it and himself as he comforted Thomas But his very laughter was new and very dreary He picked Thomas up in his arms and held him close a warm little whimpering bundle Then it was as if the touch of the small live thing that was his own and had no one in the world but him to fend for it woke in him a new instinct There sprang up in him swiftly new born out of the travail of great bitterness a sharp anger against life against fate against the whole universe of nature and man To lose and lose and lose how that goes on and on through a lifetime But at last it seems that the limit is reached something snaps and breaks and the loser rises up philosopher no more to take and grasp and seize The lust to possess to wring something for Thomas and himself out of life that had torn from them so much it sprang upon him like a wild beast and fastened deep fangs into his soul and will Outside a small April wind stirred the air of the encompassing city a faint breath from a better world seeming to speak of life and hope and new beginnings Peter laying Thomas gently on a chair went to the open window and leant out looking into the veil of the unhappy streets that hid an exquisite world Exquisiteness was surely there as always Mightn t he too he and Thomas snatch some of it for themselves The old inborn lust for things concrete lovely things to handle and hold caught Peter by the throat In that hour he could have walked without a scruple into an empty house or shop and carried away what he could of its beauties and brought them home to Thomas saying Anyhow here s something for us to go on with He was in the mood in which some people take to drink only Peter didn t like any drinks except non alcoholic ones or to reckless gambling only he didn t find gambling amusing or to some adventure of love only to Peter love meant one thing only and that was beyond his reach But when he had put Thomas to bed in his little common cheap night shirt he went out into the streets with his weekly earnings in his pockets and spent them He spent every penny he had First he went to a florist s and bought daffodils in great golden sheaves Then he went to a toyshop and got a splendid family of fluffy beasts and a musical box and a Noah s Ark and a flute He had spent all his money by then so he pawned his watch and signet ring and bought Thomas some pretty cambric clothes and a rocking cradle He had nothing else much to pawn But he badly wanted some Japanese paintings to put in the place of the pictures that at present adorned the sitting room Thomas and he must have something nice and gay to look at instead of the Royal Family and the Monarch of the Glen and Grace Sufficient worked in crewels So he went into a shop in Holborn and chose some paintings and ordered them to be sent up and said Please enter them to me so firmly that they did Having done that once he repeated it at several other shops and sometimes they obeyed him and sometimes said that goods could not be sent up without pre payment Pre payment or indeed as far as Peter could look forward post payment being out of the question those goods had to be left where they were But Peter though handicapped by shabby attire had an engaging way with him and most shopmen are trustful and obliging If they lost by the transaction thought Peter recklessly it was their turn to lose not his It was his turn to acquire and he had every intention of doing so He had a glorious evening till the shops shut Then he went home and found that the daffodils had come and he filled the room with them converting its dingy ugliness into a shining glory Then he took down all the horrible pictures and texts and stacked them behind the sofa awaiting the arrival of the Japanese paintings He thought Thomas would like the paintings as much as he did himself Their room in future should be a bright and pleasant place fit for human beings to live in He cleared the chimney piece of its horrid tinkling ornaments to leave space for his brown pottery jars full of daffodils He put the ornaments with the pictures behind the sofa and when the Girl came in with his supper requested her at her leisure to remove them I have been getting some new pictures you see he told her and was annoyed at the way her round eyes widened Why shouldn t he get as many new pictures as he chose without being gaped at There was more gaping next day when his purchases were sent up He had warned his landlady and the Girl beforehand that they might not tell the messengers it must be a mistake and send them away on what would no doubt be their stupid and impertinent impulse So they gaped and took them in and Peter hurried back early from his work and fetched Thomas in to watch him open parcels and admire the contents He spread bright rugs over the horse hair sofa and chairs and flung big soft cushions about them and said Hurrah The first time I ve been really comfortable since I left Cambridge Then he bathed Thomas and put him into a new little soft cambric night shirt and put him to bed in the rocking cradle Thomas was delighted with it all He had no doubt inherited Peter s love of all things bright and beautiful and now for the first time he had them That s more the style isn t it old man said Peter stretching himself among cushions in the arm chair Thomas agreed that it was and the two epicureans took their ease among the pleasures of the senses What next Peter wondered We must have more things still mustn t we Nice things of all sorts not only the ones we can buy But we must begin with the ones we can buy Mrs Baker will have to wait for her rent for a time I can t spare any for that I ve a good mind Thomas to take a whole holiday a long one Chuck the envelopes and take to living like a lord on tick It s wonderful how far tick will carry you if you try Muffins for tea you see Thomas only you can t have any Well what s the matter Why shouldn t I have muffins for tea You ve got milk haven t you and I m not getting a share in that Don t be grudging But we want more than muffins and milk Thomas and more than cushions and daffodils and nice pictures We want a good time We want friends we want someone to love us we want a holiday If Leslie was in England I d go and say Thomas and I are coming to stay with you for a time and you ve just got to fork out supplies for us and let us spend them Leslie would do it too But people are always away when one wants them most Oh hang it all Thomas I m not going on with those horrible envelopes I m not I m going to do things I like Why shouldn t I Why shouldn t I Lots of people do all the best people I shall give notice to morrow No I shan t I shall just not turn up then I shan t be bothered with questions And we re not going on with the friends we have here Mrs Baker and the Girl and the other envelope gummers No we re going to insist on having nice amusing friends to play with friends who are nicer than we are The Girl isn t so nice not by a long way Rodney is but he s too busy to be bothered with us much We want friends of leisure We will have them we will Why should we be chucked out and left outside people s doors just because they re tired of us The thing that matters is that we re not tired of them To morrow Thomas you and I are going down to a place called Astleys in Berkshire to visit some friends of ours If they don t want us they can just lump us good for them Why should they always have only the things they want Be ready at nine old man and we ll catch a train as soon after that as may be Thomas laughed thinking it a splendid plan He had never seen Astleys in Berkshire but he knew it to be a good place from Peter s voice when he mentioned it But I don t want to excite you so late at night said Peter so don t think any more about it but go to sleep if you ve finished that milk Does your head ache Mine does That s the worst of weak heads they always ache just when things are getting interesting But I don t care we re going to have things things to like we re going to get hold of them somehow if we die in gaol for it and that s worth a headache or two Someone says something about having nothing and yet possessing all things it s one of the things with no meaning that people do say and that make me so angry It ought to be having nothing and then possessing all things because that s the way it s going to be with us Good night Thomas you may go
