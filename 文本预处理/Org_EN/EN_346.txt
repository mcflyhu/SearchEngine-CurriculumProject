At such a parting of the ways Canterton s elemental grimness showed itself He was the peasant sturdy obstinate steady eyed ready to push out into some untamed country and to take and hold a new domain For under all his opulent culture and his rare knowledge lay the patient yet fanatical soul of the peasant He was both a mystic and a child of the soil not a city dweller mercurial and flippant a dog at the heels of profit and loss Eve had talked of the impossible but when he took Lynette by the hand and went down with her into the Wilderness Canterton could not bring himself to play the cynic Sitting in the bracken and watching Lynette making one of her fairy fires he felt that it was Eve s scepticism that was impossible and not his belief in a magnanimous future He was so very sure of himself that he felt too sure of other people His name was not a thing to be made the sport of rumour Men and women had worked together before now and did the world quarrel with a business man because he kept a secretary or a typist Moreover he believed himself to be different from the average business man and what might have meant lust for one spoke of a sacrament to the other Daddy why didn t Miss Eve come yesterday She had work at home Princess And to day too It seems so Why don t we go and see her then Why not The mouth of the child had offered an inspiration Was it possible to look into Lynette s eyes and be scared by sinister suggestions Why it was a comradeship of three not of two They were three children together and perhaps the youngest was the wisest of the three Lynette come here old lady Miss Eve thinks of going away Miss Eve going away Yes Oh no daddy how can she Well one has only to get into a train even if it be a train of thought Lynette was kneeling between her father s knees I ll ask her not to go You might try it Oh yes let s Let s go down to Orchards Corner now at once Eve had been suffering suffering for Canterton Lynette and herself She saw life so clearly now the lights and shadows the sunlit spaces the sinister glooms the sharp conventional horizons Canterton did not know how much of the woman there was in her how very primitive and strong were the emotions that had risen to the surface of her consciousness The compact would be too perilous She knew in her heart of hearts that the youth in her desired more than a spiritual dream and she was trying to harden herself to build up barriers to smother this splendid thing this fire of the gods She had taken her work out into the garden and was striving against a sense of perfunctoriness and the conviction that the life at Fernhill could not last She had more than hinted at this to Canterton bracing herself against his arguments and against all the generous steadfastness of his homage that made the renunciation harder for her to bear And now an impetuous tenderness attacked her at white heat a thing that came with glowing hair and glowing mouth and arms that clung Lynette had run up the lane in front of Canterton and Lynette was to make Eve Carfax suffer Oh Miss Eve it isn t true is it What isn t true dear heart That you are going right away Eve felt a thickness at the throat All that was best in life seemed conspiring to tempt and to betray her I may have to go dear But why why when we love you so much Aren t you happy When I am with you yes But there are all sorts of things that you wouldn t understand Oh but I could Perhaps some day you will But Miss Eve you won t really go will you Canterton came in at the white gate and Eve s eyes reproached him over the glowing head of the child It is ungenerous of you they said to let the child try and persuade me She hugged Lynette with sudden passion I don t want to go dear but some big devil fairy is telling me I shall have to She was shy of Canterton and ready to hide behind the child for there was a grim purposefulness about his idealism that made her afraid His eyes hardly left her and though they held her sacred they would have betrayed everything to the most disinterested of observers I thought I would work at home on some of these sketches And Lynette and I have been making a fire in the Wilderness We missed you Eve felt stifled Lynette was looking up into her face and she was fingering the white lace collar round the child s neck She knew that she must face Canterton It was useless to try to shirk the challenge of such a man Isn t it close to day Lynette dear what about some raspberries I m so thirsty Where are they Miss Eve Aren t they over No they are a late kind You know round behind the house Ask Anne for a dish I ll get a rhubarb leaf and pick the biggest for you Dear heart we ll share them Lynette ran off and they were left alone together Canterton had brought up a deck chair and was looking over some of Eve s sketches that lay in a portfolio on the grass His silence tantalised her It was a force that had to be met and challenged I sent Lynette away because I wanted to speak to you He laid the sketch aside and sat waiting Why did you let her come to tempt me Because I can see no real reason why you should go Her eyes became appealing Oh how blind And you let the child rush at me let me feel her warm arms round my neck It was not fair to me or to any of us To me it did not seem unfair because I do not think that I am such a criminal I know you are so sure of yourself But if you thought that the child would persuade me you were very much deceived It has made me realise more than anything else that I cannot go on with the life at Fernhill He bent forward in his chair Eve I tell you from my heart that you are wrong I want you to be something of a mother to Lynette I can give the man s touches but my fingers are not delicate enough to bring out all the charm Think now She sat rigid staring straight before her I have made up my mind It is the privilege of wise minds to change Eve I want you as well as Lynette Don t make me suffer Do you think it is easy Let me show you No no If you try to persuade me I shall refuse to listen And then silence fell on both of them for Lynette returned with a large rhubarb leaf holding a little mountain of red
