Under the great bowl of sky in the midst of the plain the three cars held their level way three little racing dots in the big clear place They kept an even course swaying to the race on level wings that swept the ground and rose to the low swale and passed beyond Only the long free line of dust marked their flight under the sun The men at the front in the car ahead did not look back again They had lost interest in the race pressing behind most anxiously they had lost interest in it They wished with a fervent wish that the two cars driving behind them should pass them in a swirl of dust and pass on out of sight toward the far horizon line that stretched the west They were only two market gardeners returning from business in the city If they drove a good car it was to save time going and coming not to race with escaping fugitives and excited police They had no wish to race with excited police fervently they had no wish for it and they slackened speed a little drawing freer breath Let the fellow pass them and his police with him before they reached a little white peaceful house that stood ahead on the plain They did not look behind at justice pursuing its prey they had lost all interest in justice and in the race Presently when justice should pass them on full spreading wing they would look up with casual glance and note its flight over the far line out of sight in the distant west But now they did not know of its existence And Achilles pressing fast had a quick clear sense of mystery something that brooded ahead on the shining plain and the little white house and the car before him slackening speed Why should it slow down what was up Cautiously he held his car slowing its waving gleam to the pace ahead and darting a swift glance behind over his shoulder at the great service car that leaped and gained on him lap by lap It would overtake him soon and he must not pass the car ahead not till he saw what they were up to Would they pass that little white house on the plain or would they turn in there The wind hummed in his ears his hair flew and his hand held tense to the wheel slowing it cautiously inch by inch slackening a little slackening again with quick flung flashing glance behind and a watchful eye on the road ahead and on the little white house drawing near on the plain It was a race now between his quick mind and that car ahead and the little white house He must not overtake them till the little house was reached The car behind must not touch him not till the house came up There was a wood ahead in the distance his mind flew and circled the wood and came back They had reached the little house asleep in the sun They were passing it neck and neck and the car beside him swerved a little and slackened speed and dived in at the white gate Achilles shot past the free road ahead The machine under him gathered speed and opened out and laughed and leaped to the road and lay down in the thick dust spreading itself ahead He could gain the wood He should escape and the clue was fast Behind him the service car thundered by the little house asleep But the police did not glance that way nor did the big white capped man glance that way His eyes were fixed on the racer ahead dwindling to a speck in its cloud of dust He pushed up his visor and laughed aloud Give it up he said genially give it up you can t catch that car I know my own car I guess He laughed again We shall find it somewhere along the road when he is through with it But the face beside him turning in the clouding dust had a keen look and the car kept its unbroken speed and the plain flashed by He s in too big a hurry said the driver sternly I want a look at that man He knows too much Too much The heart of Achilles sang again all the heart of him woke up and laughed to the miles He had found his clue he had passed the little hundred thousand dollar house and the police in their big bungling dust had passed it too Nobody knew but him and he should escape over the
