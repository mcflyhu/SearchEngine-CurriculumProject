Canterton needed pictures of the Italian gardens at Latimer Abbey and since he had received permission to show the Latimer gardens in his book it devolved upon Eve Carfax to make a pilgrimage to the place Latimer a small country town lay some seventy miles away and Canterton who knew the place told Eve to write to the George Hotel and book a room there The work might take her a week or more if the weather proved cloudy Canterton wanted the gardens painted in full sunlight with all the shadows sharp and the colours at their brightest The day before Eve s journey to Latimer was a Wilderness day Lynette had made Eve promise to have a camp tea with her in the dell among the larches Daddy says you like sweet cakes Daddy s a tease I asked Sarah and she s made a lot of lovely little cakes some with chocolate ice and some with jam and cream inside I shan t come just for the cakes dear No But because of you and your Wilderness Yes but you will like the cakes won t you Sarah and me s taken such a lot of trouble You dear fairy godmother I want to kiss you hard They started out together about four o clock Eve carrying the tea basket and Lynette a red cushion and an old green rug The heath garden on the hill side above the larch wood was one great wave of purple rose and white deep colours into which vision seemed to sink with a sense of utter satisfaction The bracken had grown three or four feet high along the edge of the larch wood so that Lynette s glowing head disappeared into a narrow green lane It was very still and solemn and mysterious in among the trees with the scattered blue of the sky showing through and the sunlight stealing in here and there and making patterns upon the ground They were busy boiling the spirit kettle when Canterton appeared at the end of the path through the larch wood Queen Mab Queen Mab may I come down into your grotto Lynette waved to him solemnly with a hazel wand Come along down Daddy Bruin He climbed down into the dell laughing That is a nice title to give a parent I might eat you both up I m sure you d find Miss Eve very nice to eat Dear child How goes the kettle We are nearly ready Here s the rug to sit on daddy Miss Eve s going to have the red cushion The cushion of state What about the cakes Sarah s made such lovely ones Eve s eyes met Canterton s It was ungenerous of you to betray me Not at all It was sheer tact on my part Tea was a merry meal with both Lynette and her father dilating on the particular excellences of the different cakes and insisting that she would be pleasing Sarah by allowing herself to be greedy In the fullness of time Canterton lit a pipe and Lynette sitting next him on the green rug with her arms about her knees grew talkative and problematical Isn t it funny how God sends people children Most strange What did you say daddy when God sent you me Here s another horrible responsibility Daddy you didn t But wasn t it funny that I was sent to mother Lynette old lady Now why wasn t I sent to Miss Eve Canterton reached out and lifted her into his lap Bruin tickles little girls who ask too many questions In the midst of her struggles and her laughter his eyes met Eve s and found them steady and unabashed yet full of a vivid self consciousness They glimmered when they met his sending a mesmeric thrill through him and for the moment he could not look away It was as though the child had flashed a mysterious light into the eyes of both and uttered some deep nature cry that had startled them in the midst of their playfulness Canterton s eyes seemed to become bluer and more intent and Eve s mouth had a tremulous tenderness Lynette was a young lady of dignity and Canterton was reproved Look how you ve rumpled my dress daddy I apologise Supposing we go for a ramble and call for our baggage on the way back Both Eve and Canterton rose and Lynette came between them holding each by the hand They wandered through the Wilderness and down by the pollard pool where the swallows skimmed the still water Lynette was mute sharing the half dreamy solemnity of her elders The playfulness was out of the day and even the child felt serious It was past six when they returned to the garden and Lynette whose supper hour was due hugged Eve hard as she said good bye You will write to me Miss Eve dear Yes I ll write She found that Canterton had not come to the point of saying good bye He walked on with her down one of the nursery roads between groups of rare conifers I am going to walk to Orchards Corner Do you mind No I haven t met your mother yet I don t know whether it is the proper time for a formal call Mother will be delighted She is always delighted A happy temperament Very They chose the way through the fir woods and talked of the Latimer Abbey gardens and of the particular atmosphere Canterton wanted her to produce for him Oh you ll get it You ll get the very thing What an optimist you are Perhaps I am more of a mystic The mystery of the woods seemed to quicken that other mysterious self consciousness that had been stirred by the child Lynette They were in tune strung to vibrate to the same subtle and plaintive notes As they walked their intimate selves kept touching involuntarily and starting apart innocent of foreseeing how rich a thrill would come from the contact Their eyes questioned each other behind a veil of incredulity and wonder You will write to Lynette Oh yes There was a naive and half plaintive uplift of her voice towards the yes Little Beech Leaf is a warm hearted fairy Do you know I am very glad of this comradeship for her sake You make me feel very humble No You are just the kind of elder sister that she needs He had almost said mother and the word mother was in Eve s heart Do you realise that I am learning from Lynette I don t doubt it One ought to learn deep things from a child They reached the lane leading to Orchards Corner and on coming to the white fence sighted Mrs Carfax sitting in the garden with the inevitable knitting in her lap Canterton was taken in and introduced Please don t get up Mrs Carfax was coy and a little fluttered Do sit down Mr Canterton I feel that I must thank you for your great kindness to my daughter I am sure that both she and I are very grateful So am I Mrs Carfax Indeed Mr Canterton For the very fine work your daughter is going to do for me I was in doubt as to who to get when suddenly she appeared Mrs Carfax bowed in her chair like some elderly queen driving through London I am so glad you like Eve s paintings I think she paints quite nicely Of course she studied a great deal at the art schools and she would have exhibited only we could not afford all that we should have liked to afford It is really most fortunate for Eve that you should be so pleased with her painting Her placid sing song voice with its underlining of the sos the quites and the mosts made Canterton think of certain maiden aunts who had tried to spoil him when he was a child Mother and daughter were in strange contrast The one all fire sensitive aliveness curiosity colour the other flat sweetly foolish toneless apathetic Canterton stayed chatting with Mrs Carfax for twenty minutes while Eve sat by in silence watching them with an air of dispassionate curiosity Mrs Carfax was just a child and Canterton was at his best with children Eve found herself thinking how much bigger gentler and more patient his nature was than hers Things that irritated her made him smile He was one of the few masterful men who could bear with amiable stupidity When he had said good bye to her mother Eve went with him to the gate Good bye Enjoy yourself And when you write to Lynette send me a word or two He held her hand for two or three seconds and his eyes looked into hers You will be delighted with Latimer Yes And I will try to bring you back what you want I have no doubts as to that She stood for a moment at the gate watching his broad figure disappear between the green hedgerows of the lane A part of herself seemed to go with him an outflowing of something that came from the deeps of her womanhood Eve dear what a nice man Mr Canterton is Nice was the principal adjective in Mrs Carfax s vocabulary Yes So good looking and such nice manners You would never have thought that he Was in trade Not quite that dear but selling things for money Of course he might give them away I suppose his social position would be greatly improved I don t think that would be quite feasible dear Really sometimes you are almost simple Canterton was walking through the woods head bent his eyes curiously solemn What I want She will bring me back what I want What is it that I want He came suddenly from the shadows of the woods into the full splendour of the evening light upon blue hills and dim green valleys He stopped dead eyes at gaze a spasm of vague emotion rising in his throat This sun washed landscape appeared like a mysterious projection of something that lay deep down in his
