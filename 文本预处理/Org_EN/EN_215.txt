Mercifully no soul can stand at the pitch of tension long Those too frail snap The strong relax As I have learned since few who have to do with lingering illness but come to know the gradual inevitable dulling of apprehension in the watchers Eric says the power of human adaptability sees to it that the abnormal state of the sufferer shall come by mere continuance to wear an air of the normal And so the watcher with no violence to loyalty or conscience is relieved of the sharper sympathy Certainly my mother seemed to us in no worse case than many a time before Bettina and I agreed that she began to improve the moment Duncombe air was no longer poisoned for her by the presence of poor Madame Aurore What Eric had said of our trustworthy servants was true Yet I had brought my mother to agree that my absence now was to be a matter only of hours even if I went back for the Coronation And still I was not spared a profound sinking[Pg ] of the heart at the moment of leave taking I put my misgiving down to the fear that parting from Bettina for four long weeks would be more than my mother s scant reserve of strength could bear As for Bettina oh when I remember that Bettina showed the bravest front calling back from the door I shall write you every blessed day Yes my mother steadied her voice to answer I shall want to hear everything The good and the less good There won t be any less good It s all going to be glorious As Big Klaus s dog cart took us across the heath I strained my eyes for some glimpse of Eric A week that day since he had come and shared his secret He could never mean to let me go without a word Not till the train was in motion could I give up hope I stood a moment longer at the window looking back No sign I took my seat between Betty and an old gentleman she and I both too stirred and excited to talk Betty half turned away looked out of her window [Pg ] and I across her shoulder and over the flying hedges looked still for a man who might be walking the field paths looked for the bright green roof of his Bungalow looked for the chimneys of the farm No sign I sat fighting down my tears Not an hour of these bustling days had been so full but I had felt the blank of Eric s silence And now again I met the ache of loss with This will teach you You were dreading a little time away He adds a week to our parting He doesn t mind It s only you poor fool only you who mind I looked round in a sudden terror lest anyone should be noticing that my eyes were wet Mercifully the people were all looking at Betty I looked at Betty too I could not see her eyes but the nearer cheek was that lovely colour whose name she gave once to an evening sky We had come up on the top of a knoll and stood for a moment breathless My mother had said no painter could get such a colour And neither were there any words in the language to describe it For it was not red not flame not pink nor[Pg ] orange But Betty looking steadily had found the right words for it A fiery rose And that was the colour in Betty s cheeks on the way to London No wonder people looked at her There was a man who got out of the first class carriage next us at every station and walked by our window He looked in at Bettina I was glad our carriage was full I felt sure if it had not been he would have come in I could see Bettina did not resent the staring And then I saw her look out of the corner of her eyes Bettina I whispered Don t encourage that strange man to stare in here Me she said What am I doing I told her again that she encouraged him But I was handicapped by not being able to say just how I admitted that what she did was very slight But it was enough It was what you did to Eddie Monmouth Then because she pretended not to understand I told her that she was falling into bad deceitful ways I knew she had written to Ranny Dallas Yes and kept writing though the moment I realised what was going on I wrote to Ranny myself I said[Pg ] if any more letters came from him I should have to tell Betty about the girl in Norfolk Ranny wrote back that he had told Betty himself And still they went on corresponding secretly I said to her now that I should hardly be surprised if she was hoping to meet Ranny in London Oh one may hope almost anything said Betty airily Not of a man who is engaged to another girl Yes said Betty as long as he isn t married Then rather frightened I asked outright if she was really expecting to meet Ranny somewhere How can I say He is fond of the opera she said in a very superior grown up way I might happen to see him some night in the throng In the throng Betty I said You have given Ranny Dallas your address No she said but I ve given it to Tom Courtney Tom Courtney was Ranny s red haired friend If you had watched Betty said you would[Pg ] know that I was corresponding with Tom Courtney too Chiefly about Ranny Tom Courtney is a splendid friend He explains things much better than Ranny can And then Betty s momentary annoyance vanished in laughter then too Tom can spell beautifully I refused to laugh I knew you d be horrified Betty said again and that is why I have to keep things from you You are a sort of nun You never feel as if all your blood had been whipped to a syllabub And besides Besides I do like nice men I don t mind their knowing And I don t mean to be an old maid You wouldn t care You think I wouldn t I had no time to say more for the train stopped We thought at first we had reached Victoria Station but it was only Clapham Junction The staring man passed once more with a porter behind carrying golf clubs and portmanteau Our carriage too was emptying The people stood and reached things down from the racks and then filed out When the train went on we were alone [Pg ] Betty was still excited but more grave even harassed a look that sat rather pitiful on her babyish face I moved up close to her again and I told her there was something I had to say before we got to London You and I you see we don t know very much and we get carried away You mean me said Betty You are thinking about Eddie Monmouth and Then I told her I did not mean her alone I don t know how it is I said remembering Mr Whitby Dawson and Captain Monmouth and Ranny yes and others I don t know how it is but girls seem to care more than men do I ve thought that too Bettina said I said I was sure it was true Men had so much to do Life was so full for them perhaps that took their minds off I put my arm round Bettina and held her close I am going to confess something I said that most older sisters would deny But you have got nobody but me And I have nobody but you We must help each other I shall have Aunt Josephine Betty reminded me [Pg ] A stranger and too old besides I dismissed Aunt Josephine for the particular purpose in view I am going to tell you something very particular Then while she looked at the cushions opposite and I looked out of the window I told her I had learned from Eric Annan what she had learned through the others We ll say it just this once and never never again so long as we live And we may have to deny it I warned her But I think if I m honest about it with you maybe you won t feel that I don t understand or that I am as you say different You will feel closer to me I pleaded And maybe we shall both be stronger for that I waited a moment I was glad Betty still stared straight in front of her We don t only care more than men do I said We need men more than they need us Bettina turned at that I felt her eyes on me Then she looked down and stroked my hand I think Mr Annan does care about you she said A little I said Not enough Not as I care Bettina pointed out that Eric Annan was not so[Pg ] young as we Why he must be thirty Perhaps when he was our age our eyes met in the new comradeship and then fell he may have taken more interest in more interest in the things we think about Then she took it back No no You may depend it s only girls who are like that caring so terribly much I thought it was only me But if you are like that too maybe there are others After a moment You were good to tell me she said I don t feel so unnatural The train was slowing The light grew grey We were in a dim place between a smoky wall and a rattling train going out as we came in Then the platform and the porters running along by our windows Luggage miss Bettina started
