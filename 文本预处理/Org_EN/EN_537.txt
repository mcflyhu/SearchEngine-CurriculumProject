That same evening at the hour when Bill Cannon and his daughter were setting out from Rocky Bar Dominick Ryan was walking up Van Ness Avenue toward his mother s house Dominick did not know at what hours balls of the kind Mrs Ryan was giving that evening were supposed to begin It was nearly three years since he had been a participant in such festal gatherings He had not been at a dance or a dinner or a theater party since his marriage He had heard that these functions as people now called them began later than they did in his day Stopping by a lamp he drew out his watch ten o clock It was later than he expected In truth as he had seen the house looming massively from its less imposing neighbors his foot had lagged his approach had grown slower and slower It was his mother s home once his own and as he drew nearer to it his reluctance to enter grew stronger more overpoweringly oppressive In the clear lamp dotted night it looked much larger and more splendid than by day When Cornelius Ryan had built it he had wanted to have the finest house in San Francisco and he certainly had achieved the most spacious and ornate Its florid ornamentation was now hidden by the beautifying dark and on its vast fa ade numerous windows broke the blackness with squares of light In the lower ones the curtains were drawn but slivers and cracks of radiance slipped out and penetrated the dusk of a garden where they encountered the glossy surfaces of leaves and struck into whispering darknesses of shrubbery The stimulating unquiet of festival was in the air Round the mouth of the canvas tunnel that stretched from the door a dingy crowd was assembled staring in at nothing more inspiring than the blank visage of the closed portal At every passing footstep each face turned to the street hopefully expectant of the first guest The whining of catgut strings swept by tentative bows struck on Dominick s ear as he pushed his way through the throng and passed up the tunnel Before he touched the bell the door swung back and a man servant he had never seen before murmured in politely low tones Gentlemen s dressing room first floor to the right Dominick stood uncertain He was only a rare occasional visitor at his mother s house and to night the hall stripped for revelry looked strangely unfamiliar The unexpectedness of a great new mirror surmounted by gold heraldic devices confused him The hall chairs were different The music loud now and beginning to develop from broken chords and phrases into the languorous rhythm of a waltz measure came from behind a grove of palms that stood back under the stairs where the organ was built into the wall Both to the right and left wide unencumbered rooms opened brilliantly lighted with flowers banked in masses on the mantels and in the corners The scent of these blossoms was rich on the air and seemed to blend naturally like another expression of the same sensuous delightfulness with the dreamy sweetness of the music Gentlemen s dressing room first floor to the right repeated the servant and Dominick became aware of the man s eyes fixed on him with a gleam of uneasy scrutiny shining through cultivated obsequiousness Where is my he was going to say mother but checked himself amending it with Where is Mrs Ryan The servant indicated the open doorway to the right and Dominick passed in Through the vista of two rooms their connecting archways uncurtained he saw the shining spaciousness of the ball room the room his mother had added to the house when Cornelia his sister had come out It seemed empty and he walked toward it stepping softly on rugs of tiger skin and polar bear He noticed the ice like polish of the oak floor the lines of gilt chairs and a thick fat garland of roses leaves and blossoms combined that was festooned along the wall and caught up at each sconce As he entered he saw his mother and Cornelia They had been standing in one corner Cornelia adjusting the shade of an electric light One white arm was raised and her skirt of lace was reflected clearly in the parquet The light shone along her bare shoulders having a gloss like old marble From the nape of her neck her hair a bright coarse red was drawn up She seemed all melting shades of cream color and ivory but for this flaming crest of copper color Her mother was standing beside her watching the arranging hand She was sixty eight years of age and very stout but her great wealth made it possible for her to employ dressmakers who were artists and experts and her Parisian costume made her look almost shapely It fell about her in dignified black folds sparkling discreetly with some jetted garnishings With their shifting gleam the glint of diamonds mingled She also wore pearls round her neck and some diamond ornaments in her elaborately dressed gray hair The coarseness of her early beginnings could not be hidden by the most proficient artificers in millinery or jewels Delia Ryan had come from what are vulgarly called the lower orders having in her ragged childhood crossed the plains at the tail board of an ox cart and in her girlhood been a general servant in a miners boarding house at Sonora Now as she stood watching her daughter s moving hand her face set in a frowning rigidity of observation was strong but unbeautiful Her small eyes shrewd and sharp were set high in her head under brows almost rubbed away The nose was short with an undeveloped bridge and keen open nostrils Her mouth had grown thinner with years the lips shut with a significant firmness They had never been full but what redness and ripeness they had had in youth were now entirely gone They were pale strong lips the under one a little more prominent than the upper There said Cornelia Now they re all even and she wheeled slowly her glance slipping along the veiled lights of the sconces In its circuit it encountered Dominick s figure in the doorway Dominick she cried and stood staring na vely astonished and dismayed Mrs Ryan turned with a start her face suffused with color The one word seemed to have an electrifying effect upon her joyous perturbing unquestionably exciting My boy she said and she rustled across the room with her hands out Dominick walked toward her He was grave pale and looked thoroughly miserable He had his cane in one hand his hat in the other As he approached her he moved the hat to his left hand and took hers You ve come she said fondly I knew you would That s my boy I knew you d come when your mother asked you Yes I ve come he said slowly and looking down as if desiring to avoid her eyes Yes I ve come but He stopped His mother s glance fell from his face to his figure and saw under the loose fronts of his overcoat that he wore his business suit Her countenance instantly with almost electric suddenness stiffened into antagonism Her eye lost its love and hardened into a stony look of defiant indignation She pulled her hand from his and jerked back the front of his coat with it What s this mean she said sharply Why aren t you dressed The people will be here in a minute You can t come this way I was going home to dress he said I am not sure yet that I can come Why she demanded His face grew red The mission on which he had come was more difficult more detestable than he had supposed it would be He looked down at the shining strip of floor between them and said trying to make his voice sound easy and plausible I came to ask you for an invitation for Berny Hah said his mother expelling her breath in an angry ejaculation of confirmed suspicion That s it is it I thought as much Mama said the girl who had been standing by uneasily listening Mama dear Her voice was soft and sweet a placating woman s voice And as she drew nearer to them her figure seeming to float over the shining parquet in its pale spread of gauzy draperies her tone her face and her bearing were instinct with a pleading feminine desire to soothe Keep quiet Cornie said her mother you re not in this turning to Dominick And so your wife sent you up here to beg for an invitation She s got you under her thumb to that extent Well go back to her and tell her that she can send you forty times and you ll not get it She can make you crawl here and you ll not get it not while this is my house When I m dead you can do what you like She turned away from him her face dark with stirred blood her body quivering Anger was not the only passion that shook her Deeper than this went outraged pride love turned to gall impotent fury that the woman her son had married had power over him so to reduce his pride and humble his manhood her only son the joy and glory of her old age her Benjamin He looked after her uncertain frowning desperate It s not right he protested It s not fair You re unjust to her and to me The old woman moved across the room to the corner where she had been standing when he entered She did not turn and he continued You re asking people to this ball that you hardly know Everybody in San Francisco s going What harm has Berny done that you should leave her out this way I don t want women with that kind of record in my house I don t ask decent people here to meet that sort said his mother over her shoulder He gave a suppressed exclamation the meaning of which it was difficult to read then said Are you never going to forget the past mother She wheeled round toward him almost shouting No no no Never Never Make your mind up to that They looked at each other across the open space the angry defiance in their faces not hiding the love and appeal that spoke in their eyes The mother longed to take her son in her arms the son longed to lay his head on her shoulder and forget the wretchedness and humiliations of the last two years But they were held apart not only by the specter of the absent woman but on the one side by a fierce unbendable pride and on the other by an unforgettable sense of obligation and duty Oh mother he exclaimed half turning away with a movement of despair His mother looked at him from under her lowered brows her under lip thrust out her face unrelenting Come here whenever you like she said as often as you want It s your home Dominick mine and yours But it s not your wife s Understand that She turned away and again moved slowly toward the corner her rich skirts trailing fanwise over the parquet He stood sick at heart looking at the tip of his cane as it rested on the floor Dominick said his sister s voice beside him go that s the only thing to do You see it s no use She made a backward jerk of her head toward their mother and then struck by the misery of the eyes he lifted to her face said tenderly I m so sorry You know I d have sent it if I could But it s no use It s just the same old fight over again and nothing gained Tell your wife it s hopeless Make her give it up He turned slowly his head hanging All right he said I ll tell her Good night mother Good night Dominick came the answer Good night Cornie he said in a muffled voice and left the room He passed through the brilliantly bright flower scented parlors and was shown out by the strange man servant The crowd at the mouth of the canvas tunnel had increased Clumps of staring white faces edged the opening and presented themselves to his eye not like reality but like a painting of pale visages executed on the background of the night They drew away as he approached them making a lane of egress for him then turned and eyed him a deserter from the realms of joy as he stopped by a lamp post to look at his watch A quarter past ten He had been in the house only fifteen minutes He did not need to go home for a while yet He could walk about and think and arrange how he would tell Berny He was a man in the full vigor of his youth strong and brave yet at this moment he feared feared as a child or a timid woman might fear the thought of his wife He dreaded to meet her he shrank from it and to put it off he wandered[ ] about the
