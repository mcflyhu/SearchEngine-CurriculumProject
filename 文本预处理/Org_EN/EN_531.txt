A week Jerry spent in the bush deterred always from penetrating to the mountains by the bushmen who ever guarded the runways And it would have gone hard with him in the matter of food had he not on the second day encountered a lone small pig evidently lost from its litter It was his first hunting adventure for a living and it prevented him from travelling farther for true to his instinct he remained by his kill until it was nearly devoured True he ranged widely about the neighbourhood finding no other food he could capture But always until it was gone he returned to the slain pig Yet he was not happy in his freedom He was too domesticated too civilized Too many thousands of years had elapsed since his ancestors had run freely wild He was lonely He could not get along without man Too long had he and the generations before him lived in intimate relationship with the two legged gods Too long had his kind loved man served him for love endured for love died for love and in return been partly appreciated less understood and roughly loved So great was Jerry s loneliness that even a two legged black god was desirable since white gods had long since faded into the limbo of the past For all he might have known had he been capable of conjecturing the only white gods in existence had perished Acting on the assumption that a black god was better than no god when he had quite finished the little pig he deflected his course to the left down hill toward the sea He did this again without reasoning merely because in the subtle processes of his brain experience worked His experience had been to live always close by the sea humans he had always encountered close by the sea and down hill had invariably led to the sea He came out upon the shore of the reef sheltered lagoon where ruined grass houses told him men had lived The jungle ran riot through the place Six inch trees throated with rotten remnants of thatched roofs through which they had aspired toward the sun rose about him Quick growing trees had shadowed the kingposts so that the idols and totems seated in carved shark jaws grinned greenly and monstrously at the futility of man through a rime of moss and mottled fungus A poor little sea wall never much at its best sprawled in ruin from the coconut roots to the placid sea Bananas plantains and breadfruit lay rotting on the ground Bones lay about human bones and Jerry nosed them out knowing them for what they were emblems of the nothingness of life Skulls he did not encounter for the skulls that belonged to the scattered bones ornamented the devil devil houses in the upland bush villages The salt tang of the sea gladdened his nostrils and he snorted with the pleasure of the stench of the mangrove swamp But another Crusoe chancing upon the footprint of another man Friday his nose not his eyes shocked him electrically alert as he smelled the fresh contact of a living man s foot with the ground It was a nigger s foot but it was alive it was immediate and as he traced it a score of yards he came upon another foot scent indubitably a white man s Had there been an onlooker he would have thought Jerry had gone suddenly mad He rushed frantically about turning and twisting his course now his nose to the ground now up in the air whining as frantically as he rushed leaping abruptly at right angles as new scents reached him scurrying here and there and everywhere as if in a game of tag with some invisible playfellow But he was reading the full report which many men had written on the ground A white man had been there he learned and a number of blacks Here a black had climbed a coconut tree and cast down the nuts There a banana tree had been despoiled of its clustered fruit and beyond it was evident that a similar event had happened to a breadfruit tree One thing however puzzled him a scent new to him that was neither black man s nor white man s Had he had the necessary knowledge and the wit of eye observance he would have noted that the footprint was smaller than a man s and that the toeprints were different from a Mary s in that they were close together and did not press deeply into the earth What bothered him in his smelling was his ignorance of talcum powder Pungent it was in his nostrils but never since first he had smelled out the footprints of man had he encountered such a scent And with this were combined other and fainter scents that were equally strange to him Not long did he interest himself in such mystery A white man s footprints he had smelled and through the maze of all the other prints he followed the one print down through a breach of sea wall to the sea pounded coral sand lapped by the sea Here the latest freshness of many feet drew together where the nose of a boat had rested on the beach and where men had disembarked and embarked again He smelled up all the story and his forelegs in the water till it touched his shoulders he gazed out across the lagoon where the disappearing trail was lost to his nose Had he been half an hour sooner he would have seen a boat without oars gasoline propelled shooting across the quiet water What he did see was an Arangi True it was far larger than the Arangi he had known but it was white it was long it had masts and it floated on the surface of the sea It had three masts sky lofty and all of a size but his observation was not trained to note the difference between them and the one long and the one short mast of the Arangi The one floating world he had known was the white painted Arangi And since without a quiver of doubt this was the Arangi then on board would be his beloved Skipper If Arangis could resurrect then could Skippers resurrect and in utter faith that the head of nothingness he had last seen on Bashti s knees he would find again rejoined to its body and its two legs on the deck of the white painted floating world he waded out to his depth and swimming dared the sea He greatly dared for in venturing the water he broke one of the greatest and earliest taboos he had learned In his vocabulary was no word for crocodile yet in his thought as potent as any utterable word was an image of dreadful import an image of a log awash that was not a log and that was alive that could swim upon the surface under the surface and haul out across the dry land that was huge toothed mighty mawed and certain death to a swimming dog But he continued the breaking of the taboo without fear Unlike a man who can be simultaneously conscious of two states of mind and who swimming would have known both the fear and the high courage with which he overrode the fear Jerry as he swam knew only one state of mind which was that he was swimming to the Arangi and to Skipper At the moment preceding the first stroke of his paws in the water out of his depth he had known all the terribleness of the taboo he deliberately broke But launched out the decision made the line of least resistance taken he knew single thoughted single hearted only that he was going to Skipper Little practised as he was in swimming he swam with all his strength whimpering in a sort of chant his eager love for Skipper who indubitably must be aboard the white yacht half a mile away His little song of love fraught with keenness of anxiety came to the ears of a man and woman lounging in deck chairs under the awning and it was the quick eyed woman who first saw the golden head of Jerry and cried out what she saw Lower a boat Husband Man she commanded It s a little dog He mustn t drown Dogs don t drown that easily was Husband Man s reply He ll make it all right But what under the sun a dog s doing out here He lifted his marine glasses to his eyes and stared a moment And a white man s dog at that Jerry beat the water with his paws and moved steadily along straining his eyes at the growing yacht until suddenly warned by a sensing of immediate danger The taboo smote him This that moved toward him was the log awash that was not a log but a live thing of peril Part of it he saw above the surface moving sluggishly and ere that projecting part sank he had an awareness that somehow it was different from a log awash Next something brushed past him and he encountered it with a snarl and a splashing of his forepaws He was half whirled about in the vortex of the thing s passage caused by the alarmed flirt of its tail Shark it was and not crocodile and not so timidly would it have sheered clear but for the fact that it was fairly full with a recent feed of a huge sea turtle too feeble with age to escape Although he could not see it Jerry sensed that the thing the instrument of nothingness lurked about him Nor did he see the dorsal fin break surface and approach him from the rear From the yacht he heard rifle shots in quick succession From the rear a panic splash came to his ears That was all The peril passed and was forgotten Nor did he connect the rifle shots with the passing of the peril He did not know and he was never to know that one known to men as Harley Kennan but known as Husband Man by the woman he called Wife Woman who owned the three topmast schooner yacht Ariel had saved his life by sending a thirty thirty Marlin bullet through the base of a shark s fin But Jerry was to know Harley Kennan and quickly for it was Harley Kennan a bowline around his body under his arm pits lowered by a couple of seamen down the generous freeboard of the Ariel who gathered in by the nape of the neck the smooth coated Irish terrier that treading water perpendicularly had no eyes for him so eagerly did he gaze at the line of faces along the rail in quest of the one face No pause for thanks did he make when he was dropped down upon the deck Instead shaking himself instinctively as he ran he scurried along the deck for Skipper The man and his wife laughed at the spectacle He acts as if he were demented with delight at being rescued Mrs Kennan observed And Mr Kennan It s not that He must have a screw loose somewhere Perhaps he s one of those creatures who ve slipped the ratchet off the motion cog Maybe he can t stop running till he runs down In the meantime Jerry continued to run up port side and down starboard side from stern to bow and back again wagging his stump tail and laughing friendliness to the many two legged gods he encountered Had he been able to think to such abstraction he would have been astounded at the number of white gods Thirty there were at least of them not counting other gods that were neither black nor white but that still two legged upright and garmented were beyond all peradventure gods Likewise had he been capable of such generalization he would have decided that the white gods had not yet all of them passed into the nothingness As it was he realized all this without being aware that he realized it But there was no Skipper He sniffed down the forecastle hatch sniffed into the galley where two Chinese cooks jabbered unintelligibly to him sniffed down the cabin companionway sniffed down the engine room skylight and for the first time knew gasoline and engine oil but sniff as he would wherever he ran no scent did he catch of Skipper Aft at the wheel he would have sat down and howled his heartbreak of disappointment had not a white god evidently of command in gold decorated white duck cap and uniform spoken to him Instantly always a gentleman Jerry smiled with flattened ears of courtesy wagged his tail and approached The hand of this high god had almost caressed his head when the woman s voice came down the deck in speech that Jerry did not understand The words and terms of it were beyond him But he sensed power of command in it which was verified by the quick withdrawal of the hand of the god in white and gold who had almost caressed him This god stiffened electrically and pointed Jerry along the deck and with mouth encouragements and urgings the import of which Jerry could only guess directed him toward the one who so commanded by saying Send him please along to me Captain Winters Jerry wriggled his body in delight of obeying and would loyally have presented his head to her outreaching caress of hand had not the strangeness and difference of her deterred him He broke off in mid approach and with a show of teeth snarled himself back and away from the windblown skirt of her The only human females he had known were naked Marys This skirt flapping in the wind like a sail reminded him of the menacing mainsail of the Arangi when it had jarred and crashed and swooped above his head The noises her mouth made were gentle and ingratiating but the fearsome skirt still flapped in the breeze You ridiculous dog she laughed I m not going to bite you But her husband thrust out a rough sure hand and drew Jerry in to him And Jerry wriggled in ecstasy under the god s caress kissing the hand with a red flicker of tongue Next Harley Kennan directed him toward the woman sitting up in the deck chair and bending forward with hovering hands of greeting Jerry obeyed He advanced with flattened ears and laughing mouth but just ere she could touch him the wind fluttered the skirt again and he backed away with a snarl It s not you that he s afraid of Villa he said But of your skirt Perhaps he s never seen a skirt before You mean Villa Kennan challenged that these head hunting cannibals ashore here keep records of pedigrees and maintain kennels for surely this absurd adventurer of a dog is as proper an Irish terrier as the Ariel is an Oregon pine planked schooner Harley Kennan laughed in acknowledgment Villa Kennan laughed too and Jerry knew that these were a pair of happy gods and himself laughed with them Of his own initiative he approached the lady god again attracted by the talcum powder and other minor fragrances he had already identified as the strange scents encountered on the beach But the unfortunate trade wind again fluttered her skirt and again he backed away not so far this time with much less of a bristle of his neck and shoulder hair and with no more of a snarl than a mere half baring of his fangs He s afraid of your skirt Harley insisted Look at him He wants to come to you but the skirt keeps him away Tuck it under you so that it won t flutter and see what happens Villa Kennan carried out the suggestion and Jerry came circumspectly bent his head to her hand and writhed his back under it the while he sniffed her feet stocking clad and shoe covered and knew them as the feet which had trod uncovered the ruined ways of the village ashore No doubt of it Harley agreed He s white man selected white man bred and born He has a history He knows adventure from the ground roots up If he could tell his story we d sit listening entranced for days Depend on it he s not known blacks all his life Let s try him on Johnny Johnny whom Kennan beckoned up to him was a loan from the Resident Commissioner of the British Solomons at Tulagi who had come along as pilot and guide to Kennan rather than as philosopher and friend Johnny approached grinning and Jerry s demeanour immediately changed His body stiffened under Villa Kennan s hand as he drew away from her and stalked stiff legged to the black Jerry s ears did not flatten nor did he laugh fellowship with his mouth as he inspected Johnny and smelt his calves for future reference Cavalier he was to the extreme and after the briefest of inspection he turned back to Villa Kennan What did I say her husband exulted He knows the colour line He s a white man s dog that has been trained to it My word spoke up Johnny Me know m that fella dog Me know m papa and mamma belong along him Big fella white marster Mister Haggin stop along Meringe mamma and papa stop along him that fella place Harley Kennan uttered a sharp exclamation Of course he cried The Commissioner told me all about it The Arangi that the Somo people captured sailed last from Meringe Plantation Johnny recognizes the dog as the same breed as the pair Haggin of Meringe must possess But that was a long time ago He must have been a little puppy Of course he s a white man s dog And yet you ve overlooked the crowning proof of it Villa Kennan teased The dog carries the evidence around with him Harley looked Jerry over carefully Indisputable evidence she insisted After another prolonged scrutiny Kennan shook his head Blamed if I can see anything so indisputable as to leave conjecture out The tail his wife gurgled Surely the natives do not bob the tails of their dogs Do they Johnny Do black man stop along Malaita chop m off tail along dog No chop m off Johnny agreed Mister Haggin along Meringe he chop m off My word he chop m that fella tail you bet Then he s the sole survivor of the Arangi Villa Kennan concluded Don t you agree Mr Sherlock Holmes Kennan I salute you Mrs S Holmes her husband acknowledged gallantly And all that remains is for you to lead me directly to the head of La Perouse himself The sailing directions record that he left it somewhere in these islands Little did they guess that Jerry had lived on intimate terms with one Bashti not many miles away along the shore who in Somo at that very moment sat in his grass house pondering over a head on his withered knees that had once been the head of the great navigator the history of which had been forgotten by the sons of the chief who had taken it The Sea
