Bowen proved to be a fairly good cook and I ventured to ask people to dinner in our little hall dining room a veritable box of a place One day feeling particularly ambitious to have my dinner a success I made a bold attempt at oyster patties With the confidence of youth and inexperience I made the pastry and it was a success I took a can of Baltimore oysters and did them up in a fashion that astonished myself and when after the soup each guest was served with a hot oyster patty one of the cavalry officers fairly gasped Oyster patty if I m alive Where on earth Bless my stars And this at Camp Apache And by Holy Jerusalem they are good too claimed Captain Reilly and turning to Bowen he said Bowen did you make these Bowen straightened himself up to his six foot two clapped his heels together and came to attention looked straight to the front and replied Yes sir I thought I heard Captain Reilly say in an undertone to his neighbor The hell he did but I was not sure At that season we got excellent wild turkeys there and good Southdown mutton and one could not complain of such living But I could never get accustomed to the wretched small space of one room and a hall for the kitchen being detached could scarcely be counted in I had been born and brought up in a spacious house with plenty of bedrooms closets and an immense old time garret The forlorn makeshifts for closets and the absence of all conveniences annoyed me and added much to the difficulties of my situation Added to this I soon discovered that my husband had a penchant for buying and collecting things which seemed utterly worthless to me and only added to the number of articles to be handled and packed away I begged him to refrain and to remember that he was married and that we had not the money to spend in such ways He really did try to improve and denied himself the taking of many an alluring share in raffles for old saddles pistols guns and cow boy s stuff which were always being held at the sutler s store But an auction of condemned hospital stores was too much for him and he came in triumphantly one day bringing a box of antiquated dentist s instruments in his hand Good gracious I cried what can you ever do with those forceps Oh they are splendid he said and they will come in mighty handy some time I saw that he loved tools and instruments and I reflected why not There are lots of things I have a passion for and love just as he loves those things and I shall never say any more about it Only I added aloud do not expect me to pack up such trash when we come to move you will have to look out for it yourself So with that spiteful remark from me the episode of the forceps was ended for the time at least As the winter came on the isolation of the place had a rather depressing effect upon us all The officers were engaged in their various duties drill courts martial instruction and other military occupations They found some diversion at the store where the ranchmen assembled and told frontier stories and played exciting games of poker Jack s duties as commissary officer kept him much away from me and I was very lonely The mail was brought in twice a week by a soldier on horseback When he failed to come in at the usual time much anxiety was manifested and I learned that only a short time before one of the mail carriers had been killed by Indians and the mail destroyed I did not wonder that on mail day everybody came out in front of the quarters and asked Is the mail carrier in And nothing much was done or thought of on that day until we saw him come jogging in the mail bag tied behind his saddle Our letters were from two to three weeks old The eastern mail came via Santa Fe to the terminus of the railroad and then by stage for in the railroads did not extend very far into the Southwest At a certain point on the old New Mexico road our man met the San Carlos carrier and received the mail for Apache I do not understand I said how any soldier can be found to take such a dangerous detail Why so said Jack They like it I should think that when they got into those canons and narrow defiles they would think of the horrible fate of their predecessor said I Perhaps they do he answered but a soldier is always glad to get a detail that gives him a change from the routine of post life I was getting to learn about the indomitable pluck of our soldiers They did not seem to be afraid of anything At Camp Apache my opinion of the American soldier was formed and it has never changed In the long march across the Territory they had cared for my wants and performed uncomplainingly for me services usually rendered by women Those were before the days of lineal promotion Officers remained with their regiments for many years A feeling of regimental prestige held officers and men together I began to share that feeling I knew the names of the men in the company and not one but was ready to do a service for the Lieutenant s wife K had long been a bachelor company and now a young woman had joined it I was a person to be pampered and cared for and they knew besides that I was not long in the army During that winter I received many a wild turkey and other nice things for the table from the men of the company I learned to know and to thoroughly respect the enlisted man of the American army And now into the varied kaleidoscope of my army life stepped the Indian Agent And of all unkempt unshorn disagreeable looking personages who had ever stepped foot into our quarters this was the worst Heaven save us from a Government which appoints such men as that to watch over and deal with Indians cried I as he left the house Is it possible that his position here demands social recognition I added Hush said the second lieutenant of K company It s the Interior Department that appoints the Indian Agents and besides he added it s not good taste on your part Martha to abuse the Government which gives us our bread and butter Well you can say what you like and preach policy all you wish no Government on earth can compel me to associate with such men as those With that assertion I left the room to prevent farther argument And I will here add that in my experience on the frontier which extended over a long period it was never my good fortune to meet with an Indian Agent who impressed me as being the right sort of a man to deal with those children of nature for Indians are like children and their intuitions are keen They know and appreciate honesty and fair dealing and they know a gentleman when they meet one The winter came on apace but the weather was mild and pleasant One day some officers came in and said we must go over to the Ravine that evening where the Indians were going to have a rare sort of a dance There was no one to say to me Do not go and as we welcomed any little excitement which would relieve the monotony of our lives we cast aside all doubts of the advisability of my going So after dinner we joined the others and sallied forth into the darkness of an Arizona night We crossed the large parade ground and picked our way over a rough and pathless country lighted only by the stars above Arriving at the edge of the ravine what a scene was before us We looked down into a natural amphitheatre in which blazed great fires hordes of wild Apaches darted about while others sat on logs beating their tomtoms I was afraid and held back but the rest of the party descended into the ravine and leaning on a good strong arm I followed We all sat down on the great trunk of a fallen tree and soon the dancers came into the arena They were entirely naked except for the loin cloth their bodies were painted and from their elbows and knees stood out bunches of feathers giving them the appearance of huge flying creatures jingling things were attached to their necks and arms Upon their heads were large frames made to resemble the branching horns of an elk and as they danced and bowed their heads the horns lent them the appearance of some unknown animal and added greatly to their height Their feathers waved their jingles shook and their painted bodies twisted and turned in the light of the great fire which roared and leaped on high At one moment they were birds at another animals at the next they were demons The noise of the tomtoms and the harsh shouts of the Indians grew wilder and wilder It was weird and terrifying Then came a pause the arena was cleared and with much solemnity two wicked looking creatures came out and performed a sort of shadow dance brandishing knives as they glided through the intricate figures It was a fascinating but unearthly scene and the setting completed the illusion Fright deprived me of the power of thought but in a sort of subconscious way I felt that Orpheus must have witnessed just such mad revels when he went down into Pluto s regions Suddenly the shouts became war whoops the demons brandished their knives madly and nodded their branching horns the tomtoms were beaten with a dreadful din and terror seized my heart What if they be treacherous and had lured our small party down into this ravine for an ambush The thing could well be I thought I saw uneasiness in the faces of the other women and by mutual consent we got up and slowly took our departure I barely had strength to climb up the steep side of the hollow I was thankful to escape from its horrors Scarce three months after that some of the same band of Indians fired into the garrison and fled to the mountains I remarked to Jack that I thought we were very imprudent to go to see that dance and he said he supposed we were But I had never regarded life in such a light way as he seemed to Women usually like to talk over their trials and their wonderful adventures and that is why I am writing this I suppose Men simply will not talk about such things The cavalry beauty seemed to look at this frontier life philosophically what she really thought about it I never knew Mrs Bailey was so much occupied by the care of her young child and various out door amusements that she did not apparently think much about things that happened around us At all events she never seemed inclined to talk about them There was no one else to talk to the soil was strange and the atmosphere a foreign one to me life did not seem to be taken seriously out there as it was back in New England where they always loved to sit down and talk things over I was downright lonesome for my mother and sisters I could not go out very much at that time so I occupied myself a good deal with needle work One evening we heard firing across the canon Jack caught up his sword buckling on his belt as he went out Injuns fighting on the other side of the river some soldier reported Finding that it did not concern us Jack said Come out into the back yard Martha and look over the stockade and I think you can see across the river So I hurried out to the stockade but Jack seeing that I was not tall enough picked up an empty box that stood under the window of the room belonging to the Doctor when thud fell something out onto the ground and rolled away I started involuntarily It was dark in the yard I stood stock still What was that I whispered Nothing but an old Edam cheese said this true hearted soldier of mine I knew it was not a cheese but said no more I stood up on the box watched the firing like a man and went quietly back into the quarters After retiring I said You might just a swell tell me now you will have to sooner or later what was in the box it had a dreadful sound as it rolled away on the ground Well said he if you must know it was an Injun s head that the Doctor had saved to take to Washington with him It had a sort of a malformed skull or jaw bone or something But he left it behind I guess it got a leetle to old for him to carry he laughed Somebody told me there was a head in the yard but I forgot all about it Lucky thing you didn t see it wasn t it I suppose you d been scared well I must tell the fatigue party to morrow to take it away Now don t let me forget it and this soldier of many battles fell into the peaceful slumber which comes to those who know not fear The next day I overheard him telling Major Worth what had happened and adding that he would roast that Doctor if he ever came back I was seeing the rugged side of life indeed and getting accustomed to shocks Now the cavalry beauty gave a dinner It was lovely but in the midst of it we perceived a sort of confusion of moccasined footsteps outside the dining room My nerves were by this time always on the alert I glanced through the large door opening out into the hall and saw a group of Indian scouts they laid a coffee sack down by the corner fire place near the front door The commanding officer left the table hastily the portiere was drawn I had heard tales of atrocious cruelties committed by a band of Indians who had escaped from the reservation and were ravaging the country around I had heard how they maimed poor sheep and cut off the legs of cattle at the first joint leaving them to die how they tortured women and burned their husbands and children before their eyes I had heard also that the Indian scouts were out after them with orders to bring them in dead or alive The next day I learned that the ringleader s head was in the bag that I had seen and that the others had surrendered and returned The scouts were Apaches in the pay of the Government and I always heard that as long as they were serving as scouts they showed themselves loyal and would hunt down their nearest relative Major Worth got tired of the monotony of a bachelor s life at Camp Apache and decided to give a dance in his quarters and invite the chiefs I think the other officers did not wholly approve of it although they felt friendly enough towards them as long as they were not causing disturbances But to meet the savage Apache on a basis of social equality in an officer s quarters and to dance in a quadrille with him Well the limit of all things had been reached However Major Worth who was actually suffering from the ennui of frontier life in winter and in time of peace determined to carry out his project so he had his quarters which were quite spacious cleared and decorated with evergreen boughs From his company he secured some men who could play the banjo and guitar and all the officers and their wives and the chiefs with their harems came to this novel fete A quadrille was formed in which the chiefs danced opposite the officers The squaws sat around as they were too shy to dance These chiefs were painted and wore only their necklaces and the customary loin cloth throwing their blankets about their shoulders when they had finished dancing I noticed again Chief Diablo s great good looks Conversation was carried on principally by signs and nods and through the interpreter a white man named Cooley Besides the officers had picked up many short phrases of the harsh and gutteral Apache tongue Diablo was charmed with the young handsome wife of one of the officers and asked her husband how many ponies he would take for her and Pedro asked Major Worth if all those white squaws belonged to him The party passed off pleasantly enough and was not especially subversive to discipline although I believe it was not repeated Afterwards long afterwards when we were stationed at David s Island New York Harbor and Major Worth was no longer a bachelor but a dignified married man and had gained his star in the Spanish War we used to meet occasionally down by the barge office or taking a Fenster promenade on Broadway and we would always stand awhile and chat over the old days at Camp Apache in Never mind how pressing our mutual engagements were we could never forego the
