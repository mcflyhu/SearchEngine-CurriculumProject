The next day according to appointment I went to Maizeville John Jones met me at the station and drove me in his box sleigh to see the farm he had written of in his laconic note I looked at him curiously as we jogged along over the melting snow The day was unclouded for a wonder and the sun proved its increasing power by turning the sleigh tracks in the road into gleaming rills The visage of my new acquaintance formed a decided contrast to the rubicund face of the beef eating marketman He was sandy even to his eyebrows and complexion His scraggy beard suggested poverty of soil on his lantern jaws His frame was as gaunt as that of a scare crow and his hands and feet were enormous He had one redeeming feature however a pair of blue eyes that looked straight at you and made you feel that there was no crookedness behind them His brief letter had led me to expect a man of few words but I soon found that John Jones was a talker and a good natured gossip He knew every one we met and was usually greeted with a rising inflection like this How are you John We drove inland for two or three miles No I didn t crack up the place and I ain t a goin to said my real estate agent As I wrote you you can see for yourself when we get there and I ll answer all questions square I ve got the sellin of the property and I mean it shall be a good bargain good for me and good for him who buys I don t intend havin any neighbors around blamin me for a fraud and that is all he would say about it On we went over hills and down dales surrounded by scenery that seemed to me beautiful beyond all words even in its wintry aspect What mountain is that standing off by itself I asked Schunemunk he said Your place well I guess it will be yours before plantin time comes faces that mountain and looks up the valley between it and the main highlands on the left Yonder s the house on the slope of this big round hill that ll shelter you from the north winds I shall not describe the place very fully now preferring that it should be seen through the eyes of my wife and children as well as my own The dwelling appears old I said Yes part of it s a good deal more n a hundred years old It s been added to at both ends But there s timbers in it that will stand another hundred years I had a fire made in the livin room this mornin to take off the chill and we ll go in and sit down after we ve looked the place over Then you must come and take pot luck with us At first I was not at all enthusiastic but the more I examined the place and thought it over the more it grew on my fancy When I entered the main room of the cottage and saw the wide old fashioned fireplace with its crackling blaze I thawed so rapidly that John Jones chuckled You re amazin refreshin for a city chap I guess I ll crack on another hundred to the price I thought you were not going to crack up the place at all Neither be I Take that old arm chair and I ll tell you all about it The place looks rather run down as you have seen Old Mr and Mrs Jamison lived here till lately Last January the old man died and a good old man he was His wife has gone to live with a daughter By the will I was app inted executor and trustee I ve fixed on a fair price for the property and I m goin to hold on till I get it There s twenty acres of plowable land and orchard and a five acre wood lot as I told you The best part of the property is this Mr Jamison was a natural fruit grower He had a heap of good fruit here and wouldn t grow nothin but the best He was always a speerin round and when he come across something extra he d get a graft or a root or two So he gradually came to have the best there was a goin in these parts Now I tell you what it is Mr Durham you can buy plenty of new bare places but your hair would be gray before you d have the fruit that old man Jamison planted and tended into bearing condition and you can buy places with fine shade trees and all that and a good show of a garden and orchard but Jamison used to say that an apple or cherry was a pretty enough shade tree for him and he used to say too that a tree that bore the biggest and best apples didn t take any more room than one that yielded what was fit only for the cider press Now the p int s just here You don t come to the country to amuse yourself by developin a property like most city chaps do but to make a livin Well don t you see This farm is like a mill When the sun s another month higher it will start all the machinery in the apple cherry and pear trees and the small fruits and it will turn out a crop the first year you re here that will put money in your pocket Then he named the price half down and the rest on mortgage if I so preferred It was within the limit that my means permitted I got up and went all over the house which was still plainly furnished in part A large wood house near the back door had been well filled by the provident old man There was ample cellar room which was also a safeguard against dampness Then I went out and walked around the house It was all so quaint and homely as to make me feel that it would soon become home like to us There was nothing smart to be seen nothing new except a barn that had recently been built near one of the oldest and grayest structures of the kind I had ever seen The snow clad mountains lifted themselves about me in a way that promised a glimpse of beauty every time I should raise my eyes from work Yet after all my gaze lingered longest on the orchard and fruit trees that surrounded the dwelling That s sensible remarked Mr Jones who followed me with no trace of anxiety or impatience Paint putty and pine will make a house in a few weeks but it takes a good slice out of a century to build up an orchard like that That was just what I was thinking Mr Jones Oh I knowed that Well I ve got just two more things to say then I m done and you can take it or leave it Don t you see The house is on a slope facing the south east You get the morning sun and the southern breeze Some people don t know what they re worth but I who ve lived here all my life know they re worth payin for Again you see the ground slopes off to the crick yonder That means good drainage We don t have any malary here and that fact is worth as much as the farm for I wouldn t take a section of the garden of Eden if there was malary around On your honor now Mr Jones how far is the corner around which they have the malaria Mr Durham it ain t a mile away I laughed as I said I shall have one neighbor it seems to whom I can lend an umbrella Then you ll take the place Yes if my wife is as well satisfied as I am I want you to give me the refusal of it for one week at the price you named Agreed and I ll put it in black and white Now Mr Jones I began with an apologetic little laugh you grow one thing up here in all seasons I fancy an appetite As I feel now your pot luck means good luck no matter what is in it Now you talk sense I was a hankerin myself I take stock right off in a man or a critter with an appetite They re always improvin Yes sir Maizeville is the place to grow an appetite and what s more we can grow plenty to satisfy it Mrs Jones made a striking contrast to her husband for she first impressed me as being short red and round but her friendly bustling ways and hearty welcome soon added other and very pleasant impressions and when she placed a great dish of fricasseed chicken on the table she won a good will which her neighborly kindness has steadily increased laconic adj He sent me a laconic private message This response was typical of the
