Peter self appointed sub editor to the Gem was revising a dissertation of Vyvian s on lace It was a difficult business this Vyvian in Peter s opinion needed so much expurgation and yet one couldn t be unkind Peter wished very much that Hilary would get rid of Vyvian Vyvian often wrote such tosh though he was clever too Came of being a bounder perhaps Peter had often noticed that bounders were apt to write tosh even clever bounders Such a sensitive bounder too that made it extraordinarily difficult to edit him satisfactorily Decidedly Hilary ought to get rid of him gently but finally That would have the added advantage of freeing Peter from the obligation of making a third with him and Rhoda Johnson Also one would feel safer one didn t really trust Vyvian not to be doing little private deals of his own so little in fact did one trust him that the names of dealers were rigorously taboo now on the Gem Peter sighed over this rather tiresome article on lace He wanted to be finishing one of his own on well heads and then he wanted to go out with Leslie and look for stone lions for Leslie s gate posts and then he and Leslie were going to dine with Lord Evelyn Urquhart There were a lot of jolly things to be done when he had finished with Vyvian s lace Peter was quite enjoying life just now it was interesting trying to set the Gem on its legs there were immense potentialities in the Gem now that toshery with dealers had been put an end to And to be allowed to write ad infinitum about well heads or anything else was simply splendid Peter heard with a small abstracted part of his mind someone talking to Hilary in the hall The low toned conversation vaguely worried his subconscious self he wished people would converse more audibly But probably it was private Peter suddenly frowned irritably and sat upright biting at his pen He was annoyed with himself It was so impertinent so much the sort of thing he most disliked to be speculating as he had suddenly found himself doing on the nature of another person s private business Had he come to that It must be some emanation from that silly syrupy article of Vyvian s Vyvian Peter felt sure would have towards a private conversation just such an attitude that he had detected in himself He settled himself to his job again and made a rather savage excision of two long sentences The outer door shut Peter heard Hilary s steps crossing the hall alone rather slowly till they stopped at the door of the saloon Hilary came in his head was thoughtfully bent and he didn t at first see Peter at the table in a corner When he did see him he started violently Hilary had such weak nerves he was always starting for no reason Peter said Things going on all right and Hilary said Yes quite and stood silent for a moment his mobile face flickering nervously as it did when he was tired or embarrassed I was looking for Peggy he added and went out He had forgotten apparently that Peggy had told them an hour ago that she was going shopping and would be out all the afternoon Peter sat quite still in his chair and bit his pen From his expression Mrs Johnson might have inferred that he had been in the Cathedral again smelling at the choky incense and had got funny feelin s within They were like the nauseating reminiscence of an old sickness He tried to ignore them He said to himself I m an ass I m a suspicious low minded ass But he was somehow revolted by the thought of going on with the work for The Gem just then He was glad when Leslie called to fetch him out Leslie said What s the matter my son Leslie had with all his inapprehensiveness of things an extraordinary amount of discernment of people he could discern feelings that had no existence Or if they had any existence in this case they must have been called into it by Vyvian s sugary periods Peter conceded that to that extent he ailed A surfeit of Vyvian Let s come out and take the air and look for little stone lions Leslie was restful and refreshing with his direct purposes and solid immobility You could be of use to Leslie because he had a single eye he knew what he wanted and requested you to obtain it for him That was simple he didn t make your task impossible by suddenly deciding that after all he didn t really want what you were getting for him He was a stable man and perhaps it is only the stable who are really susceptible of help thought Peter vaguely At seven o clock Peter and Leslie went to the Ca delle Gemme They found Cheriton there Cheriton was talking when they arrived in his efficient decisive composed business tones Lord Evelyn was pacing up and down the room his fine ringed hands clasped behind his back He looked extraordinarily agitated his delicate face was flushed crimson Denis was lying back in a low chair characteristically at ease When Leslie and Peter came in Cheriton stopped speaking and Lord Evelyn stopped pacing and absolute silence momentarily fell Then Denis gave his pleasant casual Hullo Cheriton s silence continued But Lord Evelyn s did not Lord Evelyn very tall and thin and swaying to and fro on his heels looked at Peter turning redder than before and Peter turned red too and gave a little apprehensive unhappy sigh because he knew that the fat was at last in the fire There ensued an uncomfortable scene such as may readily be imagined Lord Evelyn said and his sweet voice quavered distressingly up and down I suppose it s been a good joke But I wouldn t have thought it of you Peter Margerison I wouldn t have thought it of you Of your brother I say nothing it s a dishonest world and he s like the rest and I can t say he ever gave me any reason to trust him so I ve myself to blame But you I did trust you I thought you were a nice boy and cared too much for nice things to lie about them He broke off and looked round the room at the Diana and Act on at the Siena chalice at all the monstrous collection They weren t nearly all monstrous either not even most but he didn t know that they might be for all he could tell He looked at them all with the same bewildered hurt inimical eyes and it was that which gave Peter his deepest stab of pitiful pain You ve made a fool of me between you said Lord Evelyn and suddenly sat down as if very tired Leslie sat down too ponderous and silent in the shadowed background But Peter remained standing before them all his head a little bent his eyes on Denis Urquhart s profile He was wondering vaguely if Denis would say anything and if so what it would be Still looking at Denis he made foolish apologies because he was always polite I m frightfully sorry I ve been frightfully sorry all along Lord Evelyn lifted a white hand waving his absurdities contemptuously aside All along Oh I see At least you re honest now you don t attempt to deny that you ve known all about it then There was perhaps a fresh ring of bitterness in his voice as if some last faint hope had been killed by Peter s words Cheriton whose eyes were studying the floor lifted them sharply for a moment and glanced at Denis who was lighting a cigarette and didn t look at him You knew that first evening when you looked at the things said Lord Evelyn half a question still in his querulous voice You saw through them at once of course Anyone but a blind fool would have I ve no manner of doubt Cheriton here says he saw you see through them Peter stammered over it I I knew they weren t much Lord Evelyn turned to Cheriton whose face was still bent down as if he didn t much like the scene now he had brought it about You were right as usual Jim And Denis was wrong Denis you know he added to Peter was inclined to put your morals above your intelligence He said you couldn t have known Cheriton told him he was sure you had It seems Cheriton was right It seemed that he was Peter imagined that Cheriton would always be right After a moment s silence Peter gathered that they were all waiting to hear if he had anything to say about it He hadn t much but he might as well say it such as it was It won t make much difference of course he began and his voice sounded odd and small and tired in the great room but I think I should like you to know that all this stopped three weeks ago Hilary we decided then to to give it up and run The Gem on different lines in future We couldn t easily undo the past but but there s been nothing of the sort since then and we didn t mean there to be again Oh I know that doesn t make much difference of course The only difference that mattered was that Denis frowned Incidentally only that didn t matter Cheriton laughed curtly and Lord Evelyn wearily said Oh stop lying stop lying I m so unutterably tired of your lies You think we don t know that your brother accepted a bribe this very afternoon Tell him Jim So Jim told him He told him shortly and in plain words and not as if he was pleased with his triumph in skilful detection which he no doubt was I rather wanted to sift this business Margerison as I had suspected for a good while more than I could prove So to day I sent a man to your brother commissioning him to pretend to be an art dealer and offer a sum of money for the insertion in The Gem of an appreciative notice of some spurious objects As perhaps you are aware the offer was accepted It may seem to you an underhand way of getting evidence but the case was peculiar He didn t look at Peter his manner though distant was not now unfriendly perhaps having gained his object and sifted the business there was room for compassion It was a pity that Peter had made things worse by that last lie though I see said Peter It s all very complete And then he laughed as he always did when disasters were so very complete as to leave no crevice of escape to creep through You laugh said Lord Evelyn and rose from his chair trembling a little You laugh It s been an admirable joke hasn t it And you always had plenty of sense of humour Peter didn t hear him He wasn t laughing any more he was looking at Denis who had never looked at him once but sat smoking with averted face Shall I go now said Peter There isn t much more to say is there And what there is perhaps you will tell us to morrow It seems so silly to say one is sorry about a thing like this but I am you know horribly I have been all along ever since I found out You think that must be a lie because I didn t tell But things are so mixed and difficult and it s not a lie He was looking at Lord Evelyn now at the delicate working face that stabbed at his pity and shame After all it was Lord Evelyn not Denis whom they had injured and swindled and fooled one must remember that To Lord Evelyn he made his further feeble self exculpation And you know I did really think Hilary had dropped it weeks ago he said he would And that s not a lie either But he believed they all thought it was and a silly one at that It was Lord Evelyn who laughed now with his high scornful titter You and your sorrow I ve no doubt your brother will be sorry too when he hears the news I may tell you that he ll have very good reason to be Yes by all means go now unless you d like to stay and dine which I fancy would be carrying the joke too far even for you Will you stay one moment though There s a little ceremony to be performed He crossed the room and took the Sienese chalice between his hands holding it gingerly for a moment as if it had been some unclean thing then he dashed it on to the marble floor and it lay in splinters about his feet He took up the pair of vases next it one in each hand they happened to be of great value and threw them too among the splinters he had cleared the shelf of all its brittle objects before Leslie who had sat motionless in the background until now rose and laid a heavy hand on his arm My dear sir said Leslie tranquilly don t be melodramatic And don t give the servants so much trouble and possible injury when they do the room to morrow If you want to part with your goods may I ask to be allowed to inspect them with a view to purchase Some of them as you are no doubt aware are of considerable intrinsic value and I should be happy to be allowed to buy Lord Evelyn looked at the man of commerce with distant contempt As you please sir I ve no doubt that Mr Peter Margerison will be equally happy to give you his valuable advice in the business He is your counsellor in these matters isn t he An excellent adviser of sound judgment and most disinterested honesty He bowed to Peter who took it as a dismissal and said Good night Denis at the opposite side of the room nodded in his casual way neither hostile nor friendly but gentle and indifferent You couldn t make Denis seem angry or hurt or agitated in any way whatever He had always the air of reserving his opinion and he extremely disliked scenes To be present at this one must have been painful to him Peter who knew him so well knew that He liked things to go easily and smoothly always He had winced at the crash of glass on marble it seemed to him in such bad taste This no doubt was his attitude towards the whole business towards the Magerisons behaviour Cheriton s exposure of it and this final naked shameful scene of accusation and confession Peter was realising this as he put on his coat in the hall when the door he had shut behind him was opened and steps followed him He started and faced round a hope leaping in his face The swift dying of it left him rather pale Leslie said I m coming too It was good of Leslie thought Peter dully and not caring in the least He said No stay and dine Really I d like you to We ll talk to morrow Leslie put on his overcoat and said to the footman Call a gondola and the footman stood on the steps and cried Poppe till a poppe came then they swung away down a rose flushed water street with the after glow in their eyes Leslie was restful he didn t bother one He merely said We ll dine to night at Luigi s It was not until they had done so and were having coffee outside that Peter said We ll have to leave Venice of course directly we can You too said Leslie You go with them I go with them said Peter Well I can t well stay here can I And we may as well stick together a family party You see I haven t a notion what Hilary will do to live now I can go into business of sorts Hilary can t he d hate it so Hilary s not business like you know Nor is Peggy I couldn t trust them by themselves they d tumble into something and get broken They need my common sense to sustain them Leslie said What s the matter with your own line of life that you want to chuck it Peter looked at him in surprise It s chucked me he said Violently with a smash You don t suppose anyone will hire me again to buy their things for them There ll be something of a crab on the Margerison family in future It s going to be made very public you know this business I gathered that We shall be rather notorious in a very few days Leslie said after a moment I ve hired you to buy my things for me Are you going to chuck me And Peter leaning his forehead on his hand as if tired returned beneath his breath Don t be good to me please just now And you must see I ve got to chuck it all all that side of things We must do something quite new Hilary and I We we ve spoiled this After a pause Leslie said gently afraid of blundering You stick together you and your brother You go through it together all the way Peter answered hopelessly All the way We re in it together and we must get out together as best we can and Leslie accepted that and asked no further question gem n [ ]jewel The gem is beyond
