One miserable day Dorothy found all her friends at least those who had claimed to be her friends suddenly lost to her Those who were not openly rude enough to deliberately turn their backs upon the astonished girl made some pretense of avoiding conversation with her It all came so unexpectedly and without any apparent explanation that Dorothy was stunned even the effervescent Edna only gave her a measured smile and walked down the hall to the study room without breaking her silence The day wore on like a dream of awful fancies that try to choke but withhold even such a mercy as a final stroke What had she done Where was Rose Mary And why would not someone come and accuse her outright that she might at least know the charge against her a charge serious enough to spread in one day throughout Glenwood school Evening fell but even then Rose Mary did not come to Dorothy s room On the following day there was to be a rehearsal for the play and how could Lalia repeat her lines How could Dorothy pretend to be the happy little pilgrim who starts alone on the uncertain path of life Mrs Pangborn was ready in the recreation hall some of the others were there discussing their characters and other things The hour for the rehearsal came and with it appeared some twenty girls among them but not their leader so it seemed being Viola Green They approached Mrs Pangborn and then Adele Thomas spoke Mrs Pangborn she began with flushed cheeks we have come to say that we cannot take part in the play unless another girl is selected for the character of Lalia Why demanded the astonished principal What does this mean and she too flushed at the very idea of her pupils insurrection Because faltered the spokeswoman we do not like her She has pretended to be what she is not and never will be This was a bold speech Dorothy Dale paled to the lips Hush this instant ordered the surprised Mrs Pangborn Let no one dare make such an assertion If anything is wrong my office is the place to settle it Leave the hall instantly I shall send for you when I desire to make an investigation Mrs Pangborn placed her hand tenderly on Dorothy s shoulder as she passed out Do not worry dear she whispered This is some nonsense those girls with the new club idea have originated It will be all right But Dorothy flew to her room and alone she cried cried as if her heart would break If only Tavia had not left her If Rose Mary would only come to her Where was Rose Mary She had not even appeared at class that day But after all what did it matter Perhaps she too no Dorothy could not believe that Rose Mary would never condemn her unheard How long Dorothy lay there sobbing out her grief on the little white bed she did not know Dusk came and the supper hour but she made no attempt to leave the room A maid had been sent to her with some toast and tea and a line from dear Miss Crane but Dorothy was utterly unable to do more than murmur a word of thanks to be repeated to the thoughtful teacher When it grew so dark that the window shadows no longer tried to cheer her with their antics Dorothy was startled by a sudden tap at her door and the next moment Rose Mary had her in her warm loving arms What is it demanded the older girl at once Tell me about it What have they said to you Oh Rose Mary sobbed Dorothy bursting into fresh tears why did you leave me all alone Why I did not leave you I had to go into Rainsville early this morning and have just this very minute gotten back Mrs Pangborn knew I would be late and sent James with the cart to meet me Oh I did not know you were out of school and the explanation afforded Dorothy at least one ray of relief Didn t Nita tell you I asked her to do so at study hour Not a girl has spoken to me all day declared the weeping one Oh Rose Mary what do you think it is all about I cannot find out They seem determined not to let me know I thought you could tell me I haven t the slightest idea If only Ned or Dick would tell you then I might have a chance I ll never sleep until I find out declared Rose Mary The idea and her brown eyes flashed indignantly I never heard of such a thing You poor little dear and she held Dorothy to her in an unmistakable embrace If Tavia were here Yes she would settle it soon enough with her fists if necessary And I do believe that such work deserves just such treatment But I will do all I can for you and perhaps our vengeance will be just as sure if not so swift It seems strange that all the girls should take the same view of it reflected Dorothy I should think some of them would speak to me about it No good to try guessing at such a thing said Rose Mary wisely And now do eat up that toast Who sent it Miss Crane The dear I hold Camille Crane the guardian angel of Glenwood But eat her toast There take this sip of tea or shall I light the lamp under it I like it cold said Dorothy whose lips were quite feverish I will take the toast I feel so much better since I have you back But if I am to see Dick and Ned I must be about it spoke Rose Mary consulting her watch Just go to sleep and don t worry a single bit I ll tell you all about it to morrow and with a hearty kiss the sweet girl was gone As if events conspired to keep Dorothy worrying it was announced the next morning that Mrs Pangborn had been called to Boston and this meant of course that the investigation would have to wait for her return Neither was Rose Mary successful in gaining the desired information Molly had not heard all about it neither had Edna so they said but they did admit they had promised not to tell either Rose or Dorothy for that would mean trouble for the tale bearer It s something about Dalton said Edna really anxious to tell Rose but feeling she must keep her promise as the matter had assumed such an importance Molly declared that Amy Grant had told her it was about Dorothy and Tavia being in some awful scrape and that they had been arrested for it This seemed so ridiculous that Rose Mary did not for a moment credit it with being the story that caused the trouble She would not insult Dorothy with a hint of that silly gossip and if those girls were foolish enough she decided to believe in any such nonsense why let them go right on they must learn their own lesson So it happened that Dorothy did not get the hint that which would have been enough to afford her the opportunity of making an explanation But Edna did speak pleasantly to her after Rose Mary s talk and Molly actually apologized Mrs Pangborn had been away two days then a week had passed since the promise of an investigation and Mrs Pangborn was not at school yet The girls in Viola s club they still regarded themselves as being in it although the forbidden meetings were suspended left Rose Mary Dorothy Molly and Edna entirely to themselves Dick and Ned were charged with telling the story to Rose Mary although they stoutly denied the allegation But Adele Thomas suspected them they had always been such friends of the Dalton girls it seemed best to the Rebs to keep them out of further affairs of the kind they should hear no more of the secrets against the despised Dorothy Even the play was at a standstill nothing but lessons and sadness seemed Dorothy s share at Glenwood now If only Mrs Pangborn would come and give her a chance to speak for herself she would write home immediately and ask to go back to her dear daddy to thoughtful brave little Joe and to dear darling baby Roger Yes and Aunt Libby would love her so it would be so good to have all love again And they were all at North Birchland with Aunt Winnie Every letter brought good news of the happy home established there since Dorothy left for Glenwood I will ask to go home next week sobbed Dorothy whether Mrs Pangborn
