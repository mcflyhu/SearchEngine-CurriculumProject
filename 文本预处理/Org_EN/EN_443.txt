Tearing through the undergrowth running till they were breathless walking fast and then running again the boys made their way through the woods To save time they took a short cut but the ground was so rough that it may have proved longer in the end and before they struck the old logging road they realized that this was no light blaze in the dead wood Volumes of smoke surged over the trees and when they came within half a mile of the lake they found the way blocked Ahead of them the woods were burning to left and right Hardly any flame was visible but the forest was choking with smoke and full of the sharp smell of burning cedar In the distance they could hear the roar of the flames and the occasional crash of falling trees To save the apiary looked hopeless How in the world did it ever spring up so suddenly exclaimed Carl Don t know But we can t get through this way Got to go round it gasped his brother and they plunged into the woods again Though they were not far from the lake they had to make a wide detour to the west to reach it What they could do when they got there they hardly knew but the bees meant everything to them They could not let the apiary burn without a fight Stumbling through the smoke they reached the lake shore at last Clouds of smoke drifted over the water and the fire crashed and roared Two hundred yards away they saw the beehives dimly and ran toward them They had not yet been touched but the fire was burning straight toward the yard through the rubbish ricks along the shore Can we clear a belt around them cried Carl doubtfully Too late said Bob Can t start any counter fire either Can t we move them out of the way somehow Standing in bitter perplexity they looked from the apiary to the woods The fire was coming down the eastern shore the hives were at the southern end and would certainly be consumed when the conflagration rounded the foot of the lake There was not much flame in sight but dense smoke rolled across the water and hot ashes were falling in showers These might start fresh fires anywhere We ll get trapped here ourselves if we don t make haste Carl exclaimed Bob went down to the shore and dashed water over himself If we only had the boat we could ferry them off he said and then uttered a loud exclamation A raft a raft That s the thing Carl Make a raft Yes float em across the lake cried Carl Or up to the island That ll be best Let s get the logs together Halfway up the lake barely visible through the smoke was the little islet It was barely twenty yards in diameter but there was nothing on it to burn and it would be a safe refuge if they could get the bees to it Bob had already begun to chop furiously into a dead pine log There was plenty of timber scattered along the shore and better still there was the lumber and the nails that they had brought for the winter case Time only was lacking Both boys rushed about frantically through the smoke They dislodged the logs that lay nearest the water hewed off the large limbs and rolled the trunks down to the shore Splashing in and out of the shallow water they succeeded at last in getting half a dozen small tree trunks afloat together Carl dragged down boards from the lumber pile and Bob spiked them down with the back of his ax for a hammer We ll never do it Carl choked But they hauled in fresh timbers more boards and nailed them to the first section The smoke was growing hotter and thicker they could plainly feel the fierce breath of the fire itself Pieces of flaming bark and branches were beginning to rain down A partridge blinded by the smoke whirred over their heads and tumbled into the water Keep going Carl Bob cried hoarsely A little more ll do it Working frantically they managed to put together a few more square feet of raft and cover it with lumber It was a rickety affair but it must serve as it was There was no time to do any more Now all aboard with the bees Bob shouted He wiped his streaming eyes seized upon the nearest hive splashed with it into the shallow water and set it on the raft The bees were not flying but the smoke and heat had caused them to cluster out on the entrances in great lumps It was impossible to handle the hives without crushing bees and when this happened they stung savagely But it was no time to think of stings and the boys hardly noticed them The hives were a heavy weight however they were stuffed with willow herb honey some of them must have weighed eighty pounds and the most distant had to be carried over a hundred feet to the raft It was hardly possible to handle these single handed Already the fire had burst out around the corner of the lake and the dry wood around the apiary was ablaze A flame suddenly sprang up in the middle of the yard but Carl instantly stamped it out and went on with the work His hands were bleeding his back felt as if it were broken He hardly knew how the last hives got on the raft But suddenly there were no more of the painted boxes on the shore and his brother was crying frantically to him to come aboard He waded into the water up to his neck helped to shove the shaky raft off and swung himself upon the logs With a couple of long poles the boys worked furiously to push the raft into deep water but it moved with extreme slowness The whole shore was now aflame Masses of blazing wood driven by the wind went hissing into the water The heat and smoke were almost unendurable But foot by foot the raft crept out into the lake till the water grew so deep that they could no longer reach bottom They were forced to use the poles as sweeps and their progress became still slower We ll save them We ll do it cried Bob exultantly But they were far from safe They were about a hundred feet from shore and the heat was intense Fire flooded over the whole ground where the apiary had stood On the raft the air was scorching and presently honey and melted wax began to ooze from one of the hives The combs were melting down Carl leaned over the edge and dashed water over all the hives and it steamed up from the hot wood But he kept splashing them till they cooled somewhat meanwhile Bob was working hard at the pole Presently by good luck they passed over a shoal spot and they dug the poles into the bottom gaining several yards At that moment Carl cried out sharply and pointed ashore What is it exclaimed Bob Some one out there I saw him through the smoke just for a second the boy gasped They both gazed intently The drifting smoke clouds shrouded all the scene Then as they blew aside a little both the boys saw a human figure a man roughly dressed dodging up the shore at full speed to escape the fire Larue exclaimed Bob That s who it was For a minute I was afraid it might be Alice come to look for us said Carl But what can that fellow be doing here He must have got caught on the other shore and is running around the lake to dodge it Why Carl you don t suppose No I really don t think he d do such a thing Carl answered To try to burn out the apiary would be too much He s making for home I suppose he s afraid the fire may burn down that way There was no time then to speculate upon him any further The air was a trifle fresher now but the raft seemed to be growing more shaky every minute and the boys were afraid it would actually fall to pieces They had to propel it with the utmost care but sparks no longer fell on them and the little island was growing nearer We ve done it Carl We re safe said Bob and this time he spoke with reason Still it took another quarter of an hour of slow and anxious navigation before they grounded the raft on the island They jumped into the water and began to unload the hives at once setting them down anywhere on the stony ground This was another heavy task but when it was done they wiped their streaming faces and breathed more freely Even here the air was thick with smoke but it was not hot Driving before the breeze the fire seemed to be burning south and west from the lake and was now progressing up the western bank Probably it would burn for miles but nothing could be done now to check it You don t think it ll go near our cabin do you asked Carl suddenly Not unless the wind shifts answered Bob But I think we ought to get back there as soon as we can No telling what may happen I suppose we can leave the bees here all right till the fire s out said Carl looking critically around him But how are we going to get ashore ourselves They did not relish the idea of trying to paddle the raft over the half mile of water to land and besides they preferred to leave it where it was for use when they should remove the bees from the island Both of them could swim but neither felt equal to a swim of that distance especially as they were nearly exhausted already So for a time they sat still on the island closely surrounded by murmuring masses of their bees till it was nearly noon and they began to grow desperately hungry It seems to me a thousand years since I had breakfast said Carl Nothing for it but to swim I guess They looked and dreaded but there was really no easier way Stripping off their already soaked clothes they made them into two bundles which they tied at their necks and each took a loose plank from the raft to serve as a float With this support there was no danger of sinking though it made their progress somewhat slow and in half an hour they stepped ashore on the mainland The shore was still hot here where the fire had passed and they had to go up the lake for half a mile before they found a way around the burned area Here the fire seemed to have started spreading southward and they wondered again what had been its origin This necessary detour made it a long tramp home and they were very tired blackened and hungry when they came in sight of the cabin and perceived Alice scouting about on the trail in front evidently on the lookout for them Oh boys she exclaimed hastening toward them Are you all right I ve been almost out of my mind with fright I could see the smoke and I thought I didn t know what might happen I knew you d try to save the bees Are they all burned up Not a bit of it said Carl We rafted them off into the lake Good But I don t care for anything as long as you re both safe You must be hungry I ve had dinner ready for hours I thought of trying to carry a lunch to you but I was afraid I might miss you The fire didn t seem to be coming this way Alice enquired Bob Oh no Only the smoke was thick The bees have been frightened and cross all the morning The fire seems to me to be heading down the river toward Indian Slough I hope it doesn t get to Larue s place The boys washed off the ashes and soot sat down to the delayed dinner and ate with appetites worthy of what they had gone through Now that the physical strain was over they felt the effects of it and they ached in every muscle They were disinclined to do anything after dinner and they all sat outside the cabin and watched the apparent progress of the fire as indicated by the smoke over the tree tops It was certainly burning down toward the river but far below them and it seemed to be rather decreasing than spreading Bob fancied it had encountered a wet piece of woodland that had given it a check The sky was overcast besides looking as if rain might fall before morning On the whole things looked safe enough so the boys went to bed soon after dark and slept heavily Carl was awakened by his brother shaking his arm Get up Bob was saying Put on your clothes Hurry Very sleepily Carl obeyed without knowing what was the matter Daylight had just come In the east the sky was crimsoning delicately but down the river in the southwest it was all one fierce red glare A high wind had risen roaring through the trees and they could see the reflection of the fire on the smoke clouds and now and again even the tongues of flame themselves leaping against the sky Alice and Carl were both out doors watching in anxiety It isn t coming this way is it asked Carl when he had taken in the alarming spectacle No The wind s the wrong way responded Bob But it must be burning down mighty near our friend Larue I believe we ought to take the boat and go down He may need help Yes I m sure we ought Alice urged Seems to me I ve done enough fire fighting for awhile Carl grumbled Why yes of course we must go he added I ll be ready in a second Shall we take our axes I declare we left them both at the raft said Bob Never mind I dare say we won t need them Alice can stay and keep house again Certainly not returned Alice decisively There s a woman down there and two little girls and they may need a woman to help them I m going along Well come along then but I d rather you wouldn t said Bob with reluctance They all got into the boat and went down stream as fast as the oars and current could carry them It was growing quite light now but the morning mists and the pervading smoke blurred the outline of everything The sky was clouded and stormy looking It might rain Meanwhile the wind blew strongly and seemed still rising If this wind keeps up and no rain falls it ll mean millions of dollars loss beside very likely some lives said Bob At this rate it may go right over Morton They had gone a couple of miles down the stream before they really approached the fire zone Heavy smoke clouds whirled before the wind farther down the woods a little way in from the water seemed all ablaze on the right hand shore though the fire had not jumped the river Looks as if Larue s outfit had gone said Bob But as they drifted down things did not look so bad A short distance back from the river fire was indeed fiercely at work but along the shore there was only occasional burning trees dead ones that had been ignited by brands drifting through the air They expected to encounter the squatter s canoe but nothing appeared on the smoky water and they had come down near the beginning of the big slough when all of them all at once were startled by hearing a cry from the shore Listen What was that Stop yelled Bob They stopped paddling and listened Nothing was heard now but the snapping wood But they had all heard it a thin high pitched scream like a child s cry or perhaps the cry of some lynx or wildcat trapped in the burning forest It was some of the Larues It was one of the children cried Alice Must have been Let me ashore I ll find it Carl exclaimed You won t go into that blazing wood ejaculated Bob It isn t blazing yet but it soon will be I can always get back to the river if I m forced out No danger Keep a close lookout for me if I have to run for it Bob looked doubtful Alice frightened but Carl shoved the boat a little nearer the land and sprang out into the shallow water He deliberately dipped entirely under came up dripping and disappeared into the smoky woods waving a farewell over his shoulder The shore was lined with dense thickets of willows and small hemlocks which he brushed through Pausing he tried to look about him but the smoke haze was so dense that he could not see any distance Any one here he shouted Larue Child Petite But there was no answer Carl pushed further into the woods There was no fire yet in sight and the wind made the air less choking than it had been on the day before but the smashing and roar of the flames in the forest not a quarter of a mile away was tremendous He groped his way forward calling continually and peering everywhere till the air grew hot and he found his progress blocked by a clump of dead blazing spruces He backed off then and veered to the right going for several hundred yards in this general direction but following a very crooked course Despite all his calling and looking he could find no trace of any human being and he began to consider the search hopeless Great sparks and pieces of flaming bark were driving overhead and falling everywhere starting a hundred fresh fires Guess I d better see about getting back to the river he said to himself I ll get cut off if I m not careful He wiped his watering eyes and turned in what he thought was the direction of the water In a few minutes he saw the woods open out before him and he ran forward But instead of the river bank he found himself on the border of Larue s clearing His directions had become confused But the clearing faced on the slough at any rate and he thought he could contrive to cross the mud to the river The open space was so thick with smoke that he could see the house and barn only by glimpses and the river was entirely out of view He ran out into the open ground passing close to the barn and the memory came to him of the last time he had seen that place on the night of the bee raid Nobody would ever see it again for it was certainly doomed to go in less than an hour As he passed it occurred to him to look in on the chance that any live animal might have been overlooked there The inside was dusky and smoky and scattered with dry hay Carl perceived one of their own supers which they must have overlooked in removing the stolen honey And then he caught sight of a wisp of a pink dress in a corner He rushed toward it It was a child cowering down by some empty barrels and he had no trouble in recognizing the youngest of Larue s two little girls He had admired her great black eyes and olive skin already but now she was grimy streaked with black and ashes and frightened almost out of her senses Child exclaimed Carl How did you get here Where s your papa Sais pas whimpered the little one Je veux aller Carl knew just enough French to gather that she was too bewildered to know anything and that she wanted to go home He could not imagine how she had been left here unless indeed all the rest of the family had perished Come along I ll take care of you he said and he took her hand and led her out But her five year old steps could not keep up with him and he had to take her up in his arms and carry her With this load he knew that he could never scramble and plunge through the marsh to safety and he determined to go back by the way he had come First however he put the little girl down and ran to look into the cabin No one was there it was dismantled of all its household stuff and bore the signs of a removal in haste Plainly the squatter had got away but Carl could not conceive by what carelessness the child had been left behind Picking up the little girl again he started back through the woods The smoke was thicker it was perceptibly hotter and within thirty yards he found the ground on fire before him The trees had not yet caught but the leaves deadwood and underbrush were all aflame or smoldering making a belt impossible to cross Carl turned back across the clearing again and tried the other side Here it was even worse for there was a huge wind row of fallen dry spruces that was blazing like a furnace Again Carl was driven back and when he reached the clearing he noticed that the roof of the barn was beginning to burn ignited by falling sparks There was nothing left for it but to try the marsh He paused and looked it over trying to pick out the firmest part and at that moment he heard two quick gunshots from the river far out through the smoke It was Bob he thought signalling his position He forgot for the moment that they had brought no guns with them Carl yelled loudly in reply and strode out warily into the great slough At first it was comparatively firm then he suddenly went over his shoe tops in mire He struggled out and tried to step from one tuft of grass to another till the vegetation ceased entirely and he saw in front a dim expanse of green quagmire spotted with pools of oily looking water It was impossible to pass that way Carl struggled back to firm ground again set the child down and looked desperately about Scattered fires were breaking out all around the clearing now and here and there the tall weeds along the marsh were beginning to blaze Soon it would be impossible to remain even there He hurried up and down the margin trying the footing Nowhere could he find any solid way No doubt Larue would have known safe trails through the slough but in the hurry and flurry of the moment Carl could not hit upon one Again he heard two shots from the river The boat was no doubt moving slowly up and down in front of the marsh Carl shouted again but the roaring of the fire and wind was now so loud that he doubted if he was heard The child clung to him desperately but she did not cry Stoical from her Indian blood perhaps she gazed at him in a sort of wild silence Never mind petite said Carl I ll get you safe out of it yet But he could not see how it was to be done If he had a couple of planks to be laid down and moved forward alternately he thought he might bridge a way over the slough He hastened into the cabin again to see if there was any loose board that he could wrench off He could find nothing movable that would answer the purpose The place was littered with scraps of rubbish not worth taking away a few old muskrat skins scraps of clothing a torn blanket and an old pair of snowshoes The sight of the snow shoes now gave him an inspiration He ran out with them and hastily bound them on Here little one climb on pick a back he exclaimed stooping and the child obeyed understanding his gesture if not his words With her arms around his neck clasping her feet firmly he trudged awkwardly out into the weeds of the marsh edge A hurricane of sparks hot ashes and bits of burning wood swept over him as a clump of burning trees crashed down close to the shore He had no difficulty in getting across the first twenty or thirty feet of the slough the tufts of grass supported him easily Then the vegetation grew more scanty It almost ceased and there were stretches of bare mud sometimes thinly caked on the surface sometimes supporting straggly weeds that looked like streaks of green foam Fortunately both Carl and the little girl were light weights Together they weighed less than two hundred pounds and Carl was overjoyed to find that the snow shoes held him up whenever there was the smallest scrap of vegetation to bind the mud The meshes were old and torn Brown water bubbled up between them but they supported the weight as long as he did not pause As he went farther he had to step more and more quickly to keep from sinking till at last he was forced into a run Sinking deeper and deeper at every stride the snow shoes scattered the mud in great flakes Suddenly he tripped Overbalanced by the weight on his shoulders he went sprawling He clutched at the little girl who had shot over his head and dragged her out of an oozy pool Then a yard away he spied a rotten log half sunk in the mire and floundered to it On this support he hesitated for a few minutes Both he and the little girl were covered with mud from head to foot The shore behind him was veiled in smoke and he could not yet see the river He seemed shut off isolated on that quagmire in the midst of dimness All at once the signal shots banged again sounding less than fifty yards away Carl screamed wildly in answer and taking the child on his back started forward again But the footing became more and more treacherous He sank at every step and the mud flowed over his snow shoes and weighted them down It was only by great efforts that he avoided being stuck fast But just when the snow shoes were growing so heavy that he could hardly lift them he saw sand and gravel mingling with the ooze A little farther and a rippling line of water washed over his feet He splashed into it In two or three steps he went knee deep then to his hips He heard a splashing in the water and dimly saw the outline of an approaching boat He flung himself forward to meet it went over his head and came up trying to swim with one hand and to support the child with the other The muddy snow shoes encumbered him he dipped under again half choked then a hand gripped him by the collar and he was hauled up to the gunwale of the boat Bob he spluttered But it was not his brother It was Larue s dark face that met his streaked with black now and looking wild with anxiety Rosalie Ma petite T es sauve he ejaculated and lifted the little girl into the boat The next instant Carl himself got aboard half scrambling and half hauled up by the half breed Just then another boat rushed up out of the smoke and he heard Alice calling Carl Here he is Bo bot safe sang out the squatter He fin her Here he come crossing ze marsh on my ole raquettes It is wonderful Mister Harman zis is w at I nevaire forget Carl stuttered something unable to speak articulately He felt weak and dizzy and full of mingled smoke and water He saw the faces of Alice and Bob looking anxiously at him but they seemed to waver and everything went round dizzily when he lay back in the boat and shut his smarting eyes He was vaguely aware of the movement of the boat through the water and of talking voices He thought some one was dashing spray over him and he made a confused attempt to get up Restez said Larue and Carl rested The bump of the boat against the bank brought him to himself Water was really falling on his face Looking up he was amazed to find that it was raining The two boats had come to land at the temporary camp where Larue had removed his family A bark lean to shed was built against a tree smoke curled up from a little fire there was a shriek as Mrs Larue rushed forward to the boat and seized upon her rescued child There was a great scene of excitement and jubilation and little Rosalie who had hitherto preserved the silence of an Indian baby now began to sob as she nestled in her mother s arms He fin her cried Larue indicating Carl I have been crazy Can t guess where she go I search everywhere up down the river in ze woods in ze smoke can t fin notting T ink she dead sure But Mr Harman fin her and cross ze marais on ze snow shoes by gar Greatest t ing I ever see You re a hero Carl said Bob laughing Larue seemed to be divided between joy and gratitude at the rescue of the child and admiration at Carl s feat of crossing the slough on snow shoes His wife s protestations of gratitude were most profuse embarrassing Carl terribly It really wasn t anything he stammered Really I found her by accident But how did she ever get lost Both Larue and his wife volubly attempted to explain mixing the matter up badly It seemed that the family had been alarmed about the middle of the night by the approach of the fire and had moved out in haste In the darkness and confusion Rosalie had somehow vanished They had searched and called Larue who was very fond of his children and of this one in particular was like a madman After establishing his wife and the other child in safety he searched the shore up and down the river and went into the woods without finding any trace of the little girl On the river he had met Bob and Alice who told him that Carl had gone ashore and the two boats had rowed up and down on the lookout firing signals at intervals with Larue s gun Rosalie herself could give no coherent account of how she had strayed away or where she had been She knew only that she had found herself in the darkness and the woods had been terribly frightened and was waiting for papa to come for her cedar n The cedar was about five feet high and very shapely She struck
