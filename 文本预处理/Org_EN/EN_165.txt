I was saying proceeded the sheriff that they scared their babies in these here parts with the name of Jack Hollis Which they sure done Well sir he was bad Not all bad surely put in Vance I ve heard a good many stories about the generosity of He was anxious to put in the name of Black Jack since the sheriff was sticking so close to Jack Hollis which was a name that Terry had not yet heard for his dead father But before he could get out the name the sheriff angry at the interruption resumed the smooth current of his tale with a side flash at Vance Not all bad you say Generous Sure he was generous Them that live outside the law has got to be generous to keep a gang around em Not that Hollis ever played with a gang much but he had hangers on all over the mountains and gents that he had done good turns for and hadn t gone off and talked about it But that was just common sense He knew he d need friends that he could trust if he ever got in trouble If he was wounded they had to be someplace where he could rest up Ain t that so Well sir that s what the goodness of Jack Hollis amounted to No sir he was bad Plumb bad and all bad But he had them qualities that a young gent with an imagination is apt to cotton to He was free with his money He dressed like a dandy He d gamble with hundreds and then give back half of his winnings if he d broke the gent that run the bank Them was the sort of things that Jack Hollis would do And I had my head full of him Well about the time that he come to the neighborhood I sneaked out of the house one night and went off to a dance with a girl that I was sweet on And when I come back I found Dad waiting up for me ready to skin me alive He tried to give me a clubbing I kicked the stick out of his hands and swore that I d leave and never come back Which I never done living up to my word proper But when I found myself outside in the night I says to myself Where shall I go now And then being sort of sick at the world and hating Dad particular I decided to go out and join Jack Hollis I was going to go bad Mostly to cut up Dad I reckon and not because I wanted to particular It wasn t hard to find Jack Hollis Not for a kid my age that was sure not to be no officer of the law Besides they didn t go out single and hunt for Hollis They went in gangs of a half a dozen at a time or more if they could get em And even then they mostly got cleaned up when they cornered Hollis Yes sir he made life sad for the sheriffs in them parts that he favored most I found Jack toasting bacon over a fire He had two gents with him and they brung me in finding me sneaking around like a fool kid instead of walking right into camp Jack sized me up a minute He was a fine looking boy was Hollis He gimme a look out of them fine black eyes of his which I won t never forget Aye a handsome scoundrel that Hollis Elizabeth Cornish sank back in her chair and covered her eyes with her hands for a moment To the others it seemed that she was merely rubbing weary eyes But her brother knew perfectly that she was near to fainting He looked at Terry and saw that the boy was following the tale with sparkling eyes I like what you say about this Hollis sheriff he ventured softly Do you Well so did I like what I seen of him that night for all I knew that he was a no good man killing heartless sort I told him right off that I wanted to join him I even up and give him an exhibition of shooting What do you think he says to me You go home to your ma young man That s what he said I ain t a baby says I to Jack Hollis I m a grown man I m ready to fight your way Any fool can fight says Jack Hollis But a gent with any sense don t have to fight You can lay to that son Don t call me son says I I m older than you was when you started out I d had my heart busted before I started says Jack Hollis to me Are you as old as that son You go back home and don t bother me no more I ll come back in five years and see if you re still in the same mind And that was what I seen of Jack Hollis I went back into town Garrison City I slept over the stables the rest of that night The next day I loafed around town not hardly noways knowing what I was going to do Then I was loafing around with my rifle like I was going out on a hunting trip that afternoon And pretty soon I heard a lot of noise coming down the street guns and what not I look out the window and there comes Jack Hollis hellbent Jack Hollis And then it pops into my head that they was a big price for them days on Jack s head I picked up my gun and eased it over the sill of the window and got a good bead Jack turned in his saddle There was a faint groan from Elizabeth Cornish All eyes focused on her in amazement She mustered a smile The story went on When Jack turned to blaze away at them that was piling out around the corner of the street I let the gun go and I drilled him clean Great sensation gents to have a life under your trigger Just beckon one mite of an inch and a life goes scooting up to heaven or down to hell I never got over seeing Hollis spill sidewise out of that saddle There he was a minute before better n any five men when it come to fighting And now he wasn t nothing but a lot of trouble to bury Just so many pounds of flesh You see Well sir the price on Black Jack set me up in life and gimme my start After that I sort of specialized in manhunting and I ve kept on ever since Terry leaned across the table his left arm outstretched to call the sheriff s attention I didn t catch that last name sheriff he said The talk was already beginning to bubble up at the end of the sheriff s tale But there was something in the tone of the boy that cut through the talk to its root People were suddenly looking at him out of eyes which were very wide indeed And it was not hard to find a reason His handsome face was colorless like a carving from the stone and under his knitted brows his black eyes were ominous in the shadow The sheriff frankly gaped at him It was another man who sat across the table in the chair where the ingenuous youth had been a moment before What name Jack Hollis I think the name you used was Black Jack sheriff Black Jack Sure That was the other name for Jack Hollis He was mostly called Black Jack for short but that was chiefly among his partners Outside he was called Jack Hollis which was his real name Terence rose from his chair more colorless than ever the knuckles of one hand resting upon the table He seemed very tall years older grim Terry called Elizabeth Cornish softly It was like speaking to a stone Gentlemen said Terry though his eyes never left the face of the sheriff and it was obvious that he was making his speech to one pair of ears alone I have been living among you under the name of Colby Terence Colby It seems an appropriate moment to say that this is not my name After what the sheriff has just told you it may be of interest to know that my real name is Hollis Terence Hollis is my name and my father was Jack Hollis commonly known as Black Jack it seems from the story of the sheriff I also wish to say that I am announcing my parentage not because I wish to apologize for it in spite of the rather remarkable narrative of the sheriff but because I am proud of it He lifted his head while he spoke And his eye went boldly calmly down the table This could not have been expected before because none of you knew my father s name I confess that I did not know it myself until a very short time ago Otherwise I should not have listened to the sheriff s story until the end Hereafter however when any of you are tempted to talk about Black or Jack Hollis remember that his son is alive and in good health He hung in his place for an instant as though he were ready to hear a reply But the table was stunned Then Terry turned on his heel and left the room It was the signal for a general upstarting from the table a pushing back of chairs a gathering around Elizabeth Cornish She was as white as Terry had been while he talked But there was a gathering excitement in her eye and happiness The sheriff was full of apologies He would rather have had his tongue torn out by the roots than to have offended her or the young man with his story She waved the sheriff s apology aside It was unfortunate but it could not have been helped They all realized that She guided her guests into the living room and on the way she managed to drift close to her brother Her eyes were on fire with her triumph You heard Vance You saw what he did There was a haunted look about the face of Vance who had seen his high built schemes topple about his head He did even better than I expected Elizabeth Thank heaven for it jack n v n Jake I am looking for the headphone jack He lifted the car with a jack to
