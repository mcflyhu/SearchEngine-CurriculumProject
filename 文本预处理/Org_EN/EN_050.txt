Mrs Mellop returned from the Richmond journey in a very bad temper as she had wholly failed to get her own way with the wary millionaire Indeed she was so persistent in her attentions that Branwin put an end to them by hinting very plainly that he was engaged to be married He also gave the widow to understand that it was time she brought her visit to a close as he wished to send Audrey abroad for a time Mrs Mellop offered to accompany the girl but learnt that arrangements had been made for the young lady to stay in Paris with a French family No wonder the widow returned almost in tears as she saw very well that the vintage was ended and she had gathered but few grapes Pleading a headache she did not appear at dinner and it was not until the next morning that Audrey learnt about her father s new plans They did not please her I shan t go abroad she said bluntly when Mrs Mellop had explained matters Papa wishes to separate me from Ralph And wishes you to marry Lord Anvers finished Mrs Mellop maliciously Audrey laughed contemptuously I have refused Lord Anvers He won t take a refusal neither will your father What does that matter to me cried the girl passionately Do you think that I am going to place my happiness in Lord Anvers hands A man I detest with all my heart I shall marry Ralph and no one else Then you will lose your money said Mrs Mellop with a gesture of despair I don t mind losing it so long as I have love Love The widow made a face Oh love is all very well but it isn t money and money is a necessity To you perhaps Mrs Mellop not to me Ralph would marry me to morrow if I chose But I don t choose as such a marriage would hinder his career We must wait for better times Well I m sure I hope you ll get your own way But you can have no idea how hard your father is wailed Mrs Mellop He throws me over as coolly as though I were an old shoe and I shall have to go to morrow Oh the man s mad she added in a petty rage to think of marrying that horrid woman Well you have had your chance Audrey said with a shrug and as I told you my father has taken his own way I would rather you had married him Then you love me darling cried the effusive widow caressingly No I don t rejoined the girl removing a pair of fond arms which had been thrown round her neck but of two evils I choose the least You would make a better Lady Branwin than Miss Pearl I m sure I should assented Mrs Mellop with vigour although she was rather daunted by the refusal of Audrey to accept her advances Oh with all that money I would enjoy myself And if I married your father Audrey I should get him to let you marry Mr Shawe You have no influence with papa Mrs Mellop However you are no worse off than you were when you came here Oh but I am cried Mrs Mellop quite forgetting the jewellery and clothes that she had bought on the credit of her host s name Think of what people will say My name has been coupled with Sir Joseph s and it is a shame that he should behave so cruelly But I shan t submit quietly to seeing him carried off by that woman raged the widow walking up and down biting her handkerchief I shall tell what I know What do you know I know that Sir Joseph goes out night after night prowling about the streets Ugh the horrid old man How dare you cried Audrey flaming up Papa goes to help the poor Mrs Mellop laughed contemptuously Sir Joseph never helped a single poor person in his life she said sneeringly He goes out for no good purpose you may be sure Why he was out on the night his wife was murdered hinted Mrs Mellop malignantly I believe he had something to do with the matter Audrey had no reason to be fond of her father who had always treated her selfishly But this unfounded accusation was too much for her She sprang at the little widow and shook her How dare you talk in that way she said in a cold hard voice You can t connect my father with Oh can t I interrupted Mrs Mellop extricating herself from the girl s grasp with a shriek Why when I was waiting in Walpole Lane on that night I saw your father on the other side of the road You are a fool said Miss Branwin trying to conceal her agitation Even if you saw papa that proves nothing And you had better hold your tongue or you will get into trouble Mrs Mellop ran to the door of the room so as to avoid another shaking I shall get Sir Joseph into trouble she said spitefully He shan t play fast and loose with poor little me I shall go back home to day Had you not better see papa asked Audrey ironically and say what you intend to do I know what I intend to do retorted the widow tossing her head and it won t be pleasant for Sir Joseph when he knows You re a horrid girl Audrey and worthy of your common father who is only the son of a labourer when all is said and done I decline to associate with such riff raff so good day to both of you And Mrs Mellop bursting with spite swept out of the room in what she conceived was a grand way Audrey shrugged her shoulders when the little woman disappeared as she regarded the hinted accusation as merely due to spite and without doubt it was as Mrs Mellop could not possibly prove Branwin s complicity in the crime Sir Joseph certainly might have been in Walpole Lane although Audrey did not think that this was probable Yet even if he had been his presence as the girl had already observed proved absolutely nothing When Mrs Mellop took her departure bag and baggage which she did in the afternoon Audrey wended her way to Kensington Gardens to keep the three o clock appointment with Ralph Shawe but although she waited for over an hour he did not make his appearance This omission made Audrey confident that there was something wrong as it was not like Ralph to evade a meeting Lately she had noted his unwillingness to answer questions connected with the search for Lady Branwin s murderer and now that he so pointedly avoided her company for what could be more pointed than a failure to keep his engagement she decided to see Miss Toat and ask questions The detective certainly knew all that Ralph knew and in what Ralph refused to speak about might be found his reason for behaving so strangely With this idea the girl left the Gardens and took a cab to Buckingham Street For once Miss Perry was not in her office but the grimy little boy technically termed a clerk told her that the detective would return in a few minutes Meanwhile she was shown into the inner room to wait and found there no less a person than Colonel Ilse He rose politely when she entered and looked at her so hard that Audrey blushed I also am waiting for Miss Toat Miss Branwin said the Colonel offering a chair Will you not be seated I understand she will not be long Thank you How did you know my name Colonel Ilse I must answer like a Yankee by asking another question Miss Branwin How did you know mine Miss Toat told me And Miss Toat told me repeated the Colonel smiling The fact is I hope you will not mind my saying this as I am old enough to be your father young lady you remind me of someone who was very dear to me Curiosity made me ask your name And curiosity made me ask what yours was also said Audrey quickly Your face your eyes to be particular remind me of someone Ilse looked at her rather oddly Of whom may I ask he said eagerly The girl shook her head I can t say but I almost feel as if I had known you before I daresay it is fancy Perhaps it is and perhaps it isn t said the Colonel quietly What do you mean Nothing Miss Branwin only we may have met by chance The excuse did not satisfy Audrey but she could not very well go on asking questions She liked the looks of Colonel Ilse He had a handsome but rather sad face and his blue eyes were strangely kind and pathetic You are searching for your little girl she said impulsively Miss Toat told me Upon my word said the Colonel humorously Miss Toat seems to have told you a great deal Yes Miss Branwin I am looking for my daughter who was stolen from me some twenty and more years ago A hospital nurse took her away and I have never been able to find her Why did the nurse take her away Colonel Ilse actually blushed through his tan It was in a fit of jealousy that she did so he explained hurriedly That is she well it is too long a story to tell you But I have placed the matter in the hands of Miss Toat and lately she has told me that she thinks she will be successful in finding my daughter Audrey shook her pretty head gravely It is a long time after the loss to think of finding her I have been in India for many years said the Colonel who seemed to be singularly frank in his conversation and a military man has scanty time to attend to his own affairs But lately I have retired and as I have come in for a fortune owing to the death of my uncle I greatly wish to find my child so that she may be my heiress I hope you will be successful said Audrey sympathetically I hope so too and I think if we can trace this hospital nurse that the truth will become known The nurse has Oh Colonel Ilse stopped explaining as the door opened to reveal Perry Toat here is the lady Miss Branwin I shall leave you to discharge your business first My interview can come later And the Colonel bowed himself into the outer room Perry Toat took off her gloves and sat at her desk By this time the effect of Madame Coralie s improvements had worn off more or less and the detective was rapidly becoming the drab unlovely personage she actually was But Audrey liked her better without the mask of fictitious loveliness as she had an honest if ugly face The girl felt that she could absolutely trust her And she wanted someone to trust now that Ralph had failed her Do you like Colonel Ilse asked Miss Toat when the door closed Very much said Audrey frankly He seems to be a very nice man but sad Ah it is my task to turn his sadness into joy said the detective looking keenly at her client By finding his daughter Yes by finding his daughter assented Perry Toat who looked a sharp little rat of a woman as she sat at the table And now let us come to your business Miss Branwin I can t give you much time so please state what you wish to see me about as speedily as possible I speak in confidence of course hesitated Audrey rather embarrassed Of course in strictest confidence What is it It is about Mr Shawe I can t understand him But you are engaged to marry him Yes Audrey flushed And I love him very dearly I don t mind telling you this as you are a woman and can understand But lately there is something queer about him I wish him to learn who murdered my mother and he has been trying But over a week ago he asked me to give up the search Oh Perry Toat sat up alertly he asked you to give up the search Why Miss Branwin felt in her pocket and brought out the anonymous letter For this reason she said passing it to Perry Toat This letter warns me that if I persist in searching into the case I shall experience the greatest grief of my life Oh said Perry Toat again and ran her sharp eyes over the ill written lines And Mr Shawe agrees with this letter Yes He is most anxious to get me to give up searching and always avoids answering my questions as much as he can To day I had an appointment to see him in Kensington Gardens but he did not appear This is the first time he has ever behaved in this way so I came at once to ask you if you can tell me the reason for his change of mind Perry Toat looked hard at the anonymous letter and did not answer After a time she went to a tin box and brought out some papers with which she compared the missive addressed to Audrey Let me look at the envelope please she said after a long pause Oh here it is She picked it up from the table and examined the postmark What do you make of it asked Audrey impatiently Of this letter Oh it is written by someone who wants the case stopped By the assassin Why do you think it might be the assassin Because only the assassin would like an end put to the case Humph said Miss Toat anxiously That is one view but there is another Miss Branwin A certain person may be anxious to prevent your learning the truth in case it should cause you great pain So the letter says said Audrey quickly But I don t understand unless Suddenly she stopped with her mouth open Oh she gasped faintly for it had just occurred to her what Mrs Mellop had hinted you don t think that my father wrote it No Perry Toat looked astonished Why should you think your father It was merely an idea interrupted Audrey feverishly The fact is a certain spiteful woman hinted that my father was glad of my mother s death so that he could marry Miss Pearl In fact this person said plainly that Sir Joseph was guilty said the other bluntly Not exactly But Audrey rose quickly and looked indignant it is quite ridiculous to think of such things And yet Perry Toat tapped the anonymous letter the person who wrote this may have written it because he suspected your father He Then a man wrote it What man Can you guess I can do more than guess said the detective drily I know by comparison of handwritings This anonymous letter was written by Ralph Shawe Oh Audrey turned pale So that
