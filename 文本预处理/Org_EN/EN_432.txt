In the middle of the square Achilles stopped a lighted sign had caught his eye He hurried the child across the blur of tracks to the sign and opened a door softly A sleepy exchange girl looked up and waited while Achilles s dark fingers searched the page and turned to her Main four four seven She drawled sleepily after him Go in there number four Achilles with the child s hand in his entered the booth and closed the door Little noises clicked about them queer meanings whispered and waited and moved off the whole night life of the great city stirred in the little cage Go ahead four called the girl lazily Achilles lifted the black tube The child beside him pressed close her eyes fixed on the tube Achilles s words ran swift on the wire and her eager face held them other words came back sharp swift And the child heard them crackle and leap and break and crackle again in the misty depths and she touched Achilles s arm softly They must not hurt Mrs Seabury she said You tell them not to hurt Mrs Seabury Achilles s hand pressed her shoulder gently Yes I tell they know It was a swift aside and his voice had taken up the tale That woman you not take that woman You hear Yes she good woman Tell them to look in the cellar said Betty She had pressed closer on tiptoe There is a hole there under a barrel and a barrel in the garden You tell them His eye dropped to her In cellar You say that Yes yes Her hands were clasped They took me there You tell them Achilles s eye smiled Hallo you look in cellar What you say no I don t see it But you look in cellar yes They make tunnel yes He hung up the receiver and took her hand Now we go home he said They passed swiftly out dropping payment into a sleepy unseeing palm and crossing the square to the car that should carry them home There were no delays now only swift running wheels a few jolts and stops and they were out again beneath the stars hurrying along the great breakwater of the lake hurrying home The big red brown house thrust itself up its gables reaching to thin blackness and suddenly as they looked it was touched lightly as with a great finger and the dawn glowed mistily up the walls They crossed swiftly and mounted the steps between the lions the child s feet stumbling a little as they went but Achilles s hand held fast and his touch on the bell summoned hurrying feet there was a fumbling at the chains a swift cautious creak and the door swung back Who is it said a voice that peered out The dawn touched his face grotesquely It s me said the child It s Betty Harris Conner The man s face fell back Then he darted forward and glared at the child through the mysterious dawning light on the dark tender face and the little lip that trembled looking up My God he said He had darted from them The door was open wide and the two glided in silently and stood in the emptiness Achilles led the child to a great divan across the hall and placed her beside him her little feet were crossed in the rough shoes and her hands hung listless Behind a velvet curtain the butler s voice called frantic words a telephone bell rang sharply and whirred and rang a long fierce call and the butler s voice took it up and flung it back Yes sir She s here Yes sir that s what I said she s a settin here sir on the sofa with the furriner yes sir He put his head around the velvet curtain Will you speak to your father Miss His awe struck hand held the receiver and he helped the strange little figure to its seat in front of the phone She put the tube to her lips Hallo Daddy Yes it s Betty Mr Achilles brought me father Yes yes
