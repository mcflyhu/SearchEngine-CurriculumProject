Frona had gone at once to her father s side but he was already recovering Courbertin was brought forward with a scratched face sprained wrist and an insubordinate tongue To prevent discussion and to save time Bill Brown claimed the floor Mr Chairman while we condemn the attempt on the part of Jacob Welse Frona Welse and Baron Courbertin to rescue the prisoner and thwart justice we cannot under the circumstances but sympathize with them There is no need that I should go further into this matter You all know and doubtless under a like situation would have done the same And so in order that we may expeditiously finish the business I make a motion to disarm the three prisoners and let them go The motion was carried and the two men searched for weapons Frona was saved this by giving her word that she was no longer armed The meeting then resolved itself into a hanging committee and began to file out of the cabin Sorry I had to do it the chairman said half apologetically half defiantly Jacob Welse smiled You took your chance he answered and I can t blame you I only wish I d got you though Excited voices arose from across the cabin Here you Leggo Step on his fingers Tim Break that grip Ouch Ow Pry his mouth open Frona saw a knot of struggling men about St Vincent and ran over He had thrown himself down on the floor and tooth and nail was fighting like a madman Tim Dugan a stalwart Celt had come to close quarters with him and St Vincent s teeth were sunk in the man s arm Smash m Tim Smash m How can I ye fule Get a pry on his mouth will ye One moment please The men made way for her drawing back and leaving St Vincent and Tim Frona knelt down by him Leave go Gregory Do leave go He looked up at her and his eyes did not seem human He breathed stertorously and in his throat were the queer little gasping noises of one overwrought It is I Gregory She brushed her hand soothingly across his brow Don t you understand It is I Frona Do leave go His whole body slowly relaxed and a peaceful expression grew upon his face His jaw dropped and the man s arm was withdrawn Now listen Gregory Though you are to die But I cannot I cannot he groaned You said that I could trust to you that all would come well She thought of the chance which had been given but said nothing Oh Frona Frona He sobbed and buried his face in her lap At least you can be a man It is all that remains Come on Tim Dugan commanded Sorry to bother ye miss but we ve got to fetch m along Drag m out you fellys Catch m by the legs Blackey and you too Johnson St Vincent s body stiffened at the words the rational gleam went out of his eyes and his fingers closed spasmodically on Frona s She looked entreaty at the men and they hesitated Give me a minute with him she begged just a minute He ain t worth it Dugan sneered after they had drawn apart Look at m It s a damned shame corroborated Blackey squinting sidewise at Frona whispering in St Vincent s ear the while her hand wandered caressingly through his hair What she said they did not hear but she got him on his feet and led him forward He walked as a dead man might walk and when he entered the open air gazed forth wonderingly upon the muddy sweep of the Yukon The crowd had formed by the bank about a pine tree A boy engaged in running a rope over one of the branches finished his task and slid down the trunk to the ground He looked quickly at the palms of his hands and blew upon them and a laugh went up A couple of wolf dogs on the outskirts bristled up to each other and bared their fangs Men encouraged them They closed in and rolled over but were kicked aside to make room for St Vincent Corliss came up the bank to Frona What s up he whispered Is it off She tried to speak but swallowed and nodded her head This way Gregory She touched his arm and guided him to the box beneath the rope Corliss keeping step with them looked over the crowd speculatively and felt into his jacket pocket Can I do anything he asked gnawing his under lip impatiently Whatever you say goes Frona I can stand them off She looked at him aware of pleasure in the sight She knew he would dare it but she knew also that it would be unfair St Vincent had had his chance and it was not right that further sacrifice should be made No Vance It is too late Nothing can be done At least let me try he persisted No it is not our fault that our plan failed and and Her eyes filled Please do not ask it of me Then let me take you away You cannot remain here I must she answered simply and turned to St Vincent who seemed dreaming Blackey was tying the hangman s knot in the rope s end preparatory to slipping the noose over St Vincent s head Kiss me Gregory she said her hand on his arm He started at the touch and saw all eager eyes centred upon him and the yellow noose just shaped in the hands of the hangman He threw up his arms as though to ward it off and cried loudly No no Let me confess Let me tell the truth then you ll believe me Bill Brown and the chairman shoved Blackey back and the crowd gathered in Cries and protestations rose from its midst No you don t a boy s shrill voice made itself heard I m not going to go I climbed the tree and made the rope fast and I ve got a right to stay You re only a kid replied a man s voice and it ain t good for you I don t care and I m not a kid I m I m used to such things And anyway I climbed the tree Look at my hands Of course he can stay other voices took up the trouble Leave him alone Curley You ain t the whole thing A laugh greeted this and things quieted down Silence the chairman called and then to St Vincent Go ahead you and don t take all day about it Give us a chance to hear the crowd broke out again Put m on the box Put m on the box St Vincent was helped up and began with eager volubility I didn t do it but I saw it done There weren t two men only one He did it and Bella helped him A wave of laughter drowned him out Not so fast Bill Brown cautioned him Kindly explain how Bella helped this man kill herself Begin at the beginning That night before he turned in Borg set his burglar alarm Burglar alarm That s what I called it a tin bread pan attached to the latch so the door couldn t open without tumbling it down He set it every night as though he were afraid of what might happen the very thing which did happen for that matter On the night of the murder I awoke with the feeling that some one was moving around The slush lamp was burning low and I saw Bella at the door Borg was snoring I could hear him plainly Bella was taking down the bread pan and she exercised great care about it Then she opened the door and an Indian came in softly He had no mask and I should know him if ever I see him again for a scar ran along the forehead and down over one eye I suppose you sprang out of bed and gave the alarm No I didn t St Vincent answered with a defiant toss of the head as though he might as well get the worst over with I just lay there and waited What did you think That Bella was in collusion with the Indian and that Borg was to be murdered It came to me at once And you did nothing Nothing His voice sank and his eyes dropped to Frona leaning against the box beneath him and steadying it She did not seem to be affected Bella came over to me but I closed my eyes and breathed regularly She held the slush lamp to me but I played sleep naturally enough to fool her Then I heard a snort of sudden awakening and alarm and a cry and I looked out The Indian was hacking at Borg with a knife and Borg was warding off with his arms and trying to grapple him When they did grapple Bella crept up from behind and threw her arm in a strangle hold about her husband s neck She put her knee into the small of his back and bent him backward and with the Indian helping threw him to the floor And what did you do I watched Had you a revolver Yes The one you previously said John Borg had borrowed Yes but I watched Did John Borg call for help Yes Can you give his words He called St Vincent Oh St Vincent Oh my God Oh St Vincent help me He shuddered at the recollection and added It was terrible I should say so Brown grunted And you I watched was the dogged reply while a groan went up from the crowd Borg shook clear of them however and got on his legs He hurled Bella across the cabin with a back sweep of the arm and turned upon the Indian Then they fought The Indian had dropped the knife and the sound of Borg s blows was sickening I thought he would surely beat the Indian to death That was when the furniture was smashed They rolled and snarled and struggled like wild beasts I wondered the Indian s chest did not cave in under some of Borg s blows But Bella got the knife and stabbed her husband repeatedly about the body The Indian had clinched with him and his arms were not free so he kicked out at her sideways He must have broken her legs for she cried out and fell down and though she tried she never stood up again Then he went down with the Indian under him across the stove Did he call any more for help He begged me to come to him And I watched He managed to get clear of the Indian and staggered over to me He was streaming blood and I could see he was very weak Give me your gun he said quick give me it He felt around blindly Then his mind seemed to clear a bit and he reached across me to the holster hanging on the wall and took the pistol The Indian came at him with the knife again but he did not try to defend himself Instead he went on towards Bella with the Indian still hanging to him and hacking at him The Indian seemed to bother and irritate him and he shoved him away He knelt down and turned Bella s face up to the light but his own face was covered with blood and he could not see So he stopped long enough to brush the blood from his eyes He appeared to look in order to make sure Then he put the revolver to her breast and fired The Indian went wild at this and rushed at him with the knife at the same time knocking the pistol out of his hand It was then the shelf with the slush lamp was knocked down They continued to fight in the darkness and there were more shots fired though I do not know by whom I crawled out of the bunk but they struck against me in their struggles and I fell over Bella That s when the blood got on my hands As I ran out the door more shots were fired Then I met La Flitche and John and and you know the rest This is the truth I have told you I swear it He looked down at Frona She was steadying the box and her face was composed He looked out over the crowd and saw unbelief Many were laughing Why did you not tell this story at first Bill Brown demanded Because because Well Because I might have helped There was more laughter at this and Bill Brown turned away from him Gentlemen you have heard this pipe dream It is a wilder fairy story than his first At the beginning of the trial we promised to show that the truth was not in him That we succeeded your verdict is ample testimony But that he should likewise succeed and more brilliantly we did not expect That he has you cannot doubt What do you think of him Lie upon lie he has given us he has been proven a chronic liar are you to believe this last and fearfully impossible lie Gentlemen I can only ask that you reaffirm your judgment And to those who may doubt his mendacity surely there are but few let me state that if his story is true if he broke salt with this man John Borg and lay in his blankets while murder was done if he did hear unmoved the voice of the man calling to him for help if he did lie there and watch that carnival of butchery without his manhood prompting him let me state gentlemen I say let me state that he is none the less deserveful of hanging We cannot make a mistake What shall it be Death String him up Stretch m were the cries But the crowd suddenly turned its attention to the river and even Blackey refrained from his official task A large raft worked by a sweep at either end was slipping past the tail of Split up Island close to the shore When it was at their feet its nose was slewed into the bank and while its free end swung into the stream to make the consequent circle a snubbing rope was flung ashore and several turns taken about the tree under which St Vincent stood A cargo of moose meat red and raw cut into quarters peeped from beneath a cool covering of spruce boughs And because of this the two men on the raft looked up to those on the bank with pride in their eyes Tryin to make Dawson with it one of them explained and the sun s all fired hot Nope said his comrade in reply to a query don t care to stop and trade It s worth a dollar and a half a pound down below and we re hustlin to get there But we ve got some pieces of a man we want to leave with you He turned and pointed to a loose heap of blankets which slightly disclosed the form of a man beneath We gathered him in this mornin bout thirty mile up the Stewart I should judge Stands in need of doctorin the other man spoke up and the meat s spoilin and we ain t got time for nothin Beggar don t have anythin to say Don t savve the burro Looks as he might have been mixin things with a grizzly or somethin all battered and gouged Injured internally from the looks of it Where ll you have him Frona standing by St Vincent saw the injured man borne over the crest of the bank and through the crowd A bronzed hand drooped down and a bronzed face showed from out the blankets The bearers halted near them while a decision could be reached as to where he should be carried Frona felt a sudden fierce grip on her arm Look look St Vincent was leaning forward and pointing wildly at the injured man Look That scar The Indian opened his eyes and a grin of recognition distorted his face It is he It is he St Vincent trembling with eagerness turned upon the crowd I call you all to witness That is the man who killed John Borg No laughter greeted this for there was a terrible earnestness in his manner Bill Brown and the chairman tried to make the Indian talk but could not A miner from British Columbia was pressed into service but his Chinook made no impression Then La Flitche was called The handsome breed bent over the man and talked in gutturals which only his mother s heredity made possible It sounded all one yet it was apparent that he was trying many tongues But no response did he draw and he paused disheartened As though with sudden recollection he made another attempt At once a gleam of intelligence shot across the Indian s face and his larynx vibrated to similar sounds It is the Stick talk of the Upper White La Flitche stopped long enough to explain Then with knit brows and stumbling moments when he sought dim remembered words he plied the man with questions To the rest it was like a pantomime the meaningless grunts and waving arms and facial expressions of puzzlement surprise and understanding At times a passion wrote itself on the face of the Indian and a sympathy on the face of La Flitche Again by look and gesture St Vincent was referred to and once a sober mirthless laugh shaped the mouths of them So It is good La Flitche said when the Indian s head dropped back This man make true talk He come from White River way up He cannot understand He surprised very much so many white men He never think so many white men in the world He die soon His name Gow Long time ago three year this man John Borg go to this man Gow s country He hunt he bring plenty meat to the camp wherefore White River Sticks like him Gow have one squaw Pisk ku Bime by John Borg make preparation to go way He go to Gow and he say Give me your squaw We trade For her I give you many things But Gow say no Pisk ku good squaw No woman sew moccasin like she She tan moose skin the best and make the softest leather He like Pisk ku Then John Borg say he don t care he want Pisk ku Then they have a skookum big fight and Pisk ku go way with John Borg She no want to go way but she go anyway Borg call her Bella and give her plenty good things but she like Gow all the time La Flitche pointed to the scar which ran down the forehead and past the eye of the Indian John Borg he do that Long time Gow pretty near die Then he get well but his head sick He don t know nobody Don t know his father his mother or anything Just like a little baby Just like that Then one day quick click something snap and his head get well all at once He know his father and mother he remember Pisk ku he remember everything His father say John Borg go down river Then Gow go down river Spring time ice very bad He very much afraid so many white men and when he come to this place he travel by night Nobody see him tall but he see everybody He like a cat see in the dark Somehow he come straight to John Borg s cabin He do not know how this was except that the work he had to do was good work St Vincent pressed Frona s hand but she shook her fingers clear and withdrew a step He see Pisk ku feed the dogs and he have talk with her That night he come and she open the door Then you know that which was done St Vincent do nothing Borg kill Bella Gow kill Borg Borg kill Gow for Gow die pretty quick Borg have strong arm Gow sick inside all smashed up Gow no care Pisk ku dead After that he go cross ice to the land I tell him all you people say it cannot be no man can cross the ice at that time He laugh and say that it is and what is must be Anyway he have very hard time but he get cross all right He very sick inside Bime by he cannot walk he crawl Long time he come to Stewart River Can go no more so he lay down to die Two white men find him and bring him to this place He don t care He die anyway La Flitche finished abruptly but nobody spoke Then he added I think Gow damn good man Frona
