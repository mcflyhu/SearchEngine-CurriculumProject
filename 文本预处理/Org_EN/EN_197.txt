When to morrow came we knew We had been using up our capital Another year at this rate and it would be gone What was to become of us Should we have to sell Duncombe House I asked Only then we heard that Duncombe belonged to Lord Helmstone But the rent was low My mother said at the worst we would go on living at Duncombe Yes even if we kept only one servant instead of three For we would still have the tiny pension granted an officer s widow And should we always have the pension Yes as long as she lived Not always then A horrible feeling of helplessness a sense of the bigness of the world and of our littleness came down upon me [Pg ] We seemed to have almost no relations We knew our father had a step sister a good deal older than he We heard that she lived in London and was childless That was all My mother had been an orphan She never seemed to want to talk about the past When we were little we took no interest in these things As we grew older we grew afraid of paining her with questions In some crisis of house cleaning a photograph came to the surface Who was this with the hair rolled high and the pear shaped earrings Oh that was Mrs Harborough Aunt Josephine Well your father s step sister All hope of better acquaintance with her was dashed by learning that she had opposed our father s marriage opposed it bitterly She couldn t have known you Bettina said That I was not known to her was crime enough my mother answered with unwonted bitterness Just as we were made to feel that questions about Aunt Josephine were troubling I felt now that to inquire into our precise financial condition was to harass and depress my mother The condition[Pg ] was bad Therefore it was best covered up We shall manage she said I was sixteen when this thunder bolt descended and by that time I knew that to manage was just what my mother at all events was quite incapable of doing We still kept three servants and no accounts Lawyers letters were put away Out of sight they seemed to be out of mind Out of my mother s mind I thought constantly about these things One day months later I blurted out a hope that we should all die together My mother was horrified But if we don t I said how are we going to live Bettina and I without the pension You will have husbands I hope to take care of you I went over the grounds for this hope with no great confidence My mother went alone into the garden She came in looking tired and white Compunction seized me I persuaded her to go and lie down I would bring up her tea tray I expected to have to beg and urge But she went[Pg ] upstairs quite goodly as we used to say She looked back and smiled She was still the most beautiful person we knew But it was a very waxen beauty now I must learn not to weary her with insoluble riddles I went into the dining room to make her tray ready I liked doing it myself Bettina s voice came floating in She had grown tired of playing proper music She was singing the nursery rhyme which my mother had set to variations of the tinkling old world tune Where are you going to my pretty maid I thought how strange and wonderful was the simplest most ordinary little life There must always be that question what is going to become of me I had long known what was the proper thing to happen I ought to marry Lord Helmstone s heir And Bettina should marry a prince But Lord Helmstone s heir turned out to be a middle aged cousin with a family Lord Helmstone himself had only lately taken to coming to Forest Hall since the laying out of the golf course Still less frequently came my lady Very[Pg ] smart with amazing clothes and some married daughters with babies There were two daughters unmarried who seemed to be always abroad or in London We liked Lord Helmstone even my mother liked him But she criticised his noisy friends These were the golfers who motored down from London Broad shouldered men in tweeds that made them seem broader still They would pass by our garden wall and look at Bettina Often when they had passed they looked back Secretly I wondered if any of them were those husbands who were going to take care of us Some lodged in the village The noisiest stayed at the Hall Bettina s singing had broken off abruptly I heard her running upstairs And then a cry Come oh quickly quickly Bettina had heard the fall overhead Our mother lay on the floor Bettina standing over her agonised helpless We lifted her on to the bed We loosened her clothing and brought water and bathed her temples [Pg ] She opened her eyes and smiled then the lids went down Still that look the look that made her a stranger Was this death Bettina shrank from it But I told her not to leave the room a second I would bring the doctor quickly Bettina s face I cannot stay alone she whispered
