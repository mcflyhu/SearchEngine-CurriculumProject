The sleep of the night seemed to blot out the excitement of the preceding evening A bright sun a cool stir of air brought in the next morning and certainly calamity had never seemed farther from the Cornish ranch than it did on this day All through the morning people kept arriving in ones and twos Every buckboard on the place was commissioned to haul the guests around the smooth roads and show them the estate and those who preferred were furnished with saddle horses from the stable to keep their own mounts fresh for their return trip Vance took charge of the wagon parties Terence himself guided the horsemen and he rode El Sangre a flashing streak of blood red The exercise brought the color to his face the wind raised his spirits and when the gathering at the house to wait for the big dinner began he was as gay as any That s the way with young people Elizabeth confided to her brother Trouble slips off their minds And then the second blow fell the blow on which Vance had counted for his great results No less a person than Sheriff Joe Minter galloped up and threw his reins before the veranda He approached Elizabeth with a high flourish of his hat and a profound bow for Uncle Joe Minter affected the mannered courtesy of the Southern school Vance had them in profile from the side and his nervous glance flickered from one to the other The sheriff was plainly pleased with what he had seen on his way up Bear Creek He was also happy to be present at so large a gathering But to Elizabeth his coming was like a death Her brother could tell the difference between her forced cordiality and the real thing She had his horse put up presented him to the few people whom he had not met and then left him posing for the crowd of admirers Life to the sheriff was truly a stage Then Elizabeth went to Vance You saw she gasped Sheriff Minter What of it Rather nervy of the old ass to come up here for the party he hardly knows us No no Not that But don t you remember Don t you remember what Joe Minter did Good Lord gasped Vance apparently just recalling He killed Black Jack And what will Terry do when he finds out She grew still whiter hearing him name her own fear They mustn t meet she said desperately Vance if you re half a man you ll find some way of getting that pompous windy idiot off the place My dear Do you want me to invite him to leave Something I don t care what Neither do I But I can t insult the fool That type resents an insult with gunplay We must simply keep them apart Keep the sheriff from talking Keep rain from falling groaned Elizabeth Vance if you won t do anything I ll go and tell the sheriff that he must leave You don t mean it Do you think that I m going to risk a murder I suppose you re right nodded Vance changing his tactics with Machiavellian smoothness If Terry saw the man who killed his father all his twenty four years of training would go up in smoke and the blood of his father would talk in him There d be a shooting She caught a hand to her throat I m not so sure of that Vance I think he would come through this acid test But I don t want to take chances I don t blame you Elizabeth said her brother heartily Neither would I But if the sheriff stays here I feel that I m going to win the bet that I made twenty four years ago You remember That Terry would shoot a man before he was twenty five Have I ever forgotten she said huskily Have I ever let it go out of my mind But it isn t the danger of Terry shooting It s the danger of Terry being shot If he should reach for a gun against the sheriff that professional mankiller Vance something has to be done Right he nodded I wouldn t trust Terry in the face of such a temptation to violence Not for a moment The natural stubbornness on which he had counted hardened in her face I don t know It would be an acid test Elizabeth But perhaps now is the time You ve spent twenty four years training him If he isn t what he ought to be now he never will be no doubt It may be that you re right she said gloomily Twenty four years Yes and I ve filled about half of my time with Terry and his training Vance you are right If he has the elements of a mankiller in him after what I ve done for him then he s a hopeless case The sheriff shall stay The sheriff shall stay She kept repeating it as though the repetition of the phrase might bring her courage And then she went back among her guests As for Vance he remained skillfully in the background that day It was peculiarly vital this day of all days that he should not be much in evidence No one must see in him a controlling influence In the meantime he watched his sister with a growing admiration and with a growing concern Instantly she had a problem on her hands For the moment Terence heard that the great sheriff himself had joined the party he was filled with happiness Vance watched them meet with a heart swelling with happiness and surety of success Straight through a group came Terry weaving his way eagerly and went up to the sheriff Vance saw Elizabeth attempt to detain him attempt to send him on an errand But he waved her suggestion away for a moment and made for the sheriff Elizabeth seeing that the meeting could not be avoided at least determined to be present at it She came up with Terence and presented him Sheriff Minter this is Terence Colby I ve heard of you Colby said the sheriff kindly And he waited for a response with the gleaming eye of a vain man There was not long to wait You ve really heard of me said Terry immensely pleased By the Lord I ve heard of you sheriff But of course everybody has I dunno son said the sheriff benevolently But I been drifting around a tolerable long time I guess Why said Terry with a sort of outburst I ve simply eaten up everything I could gather I ve even read about you in magazines Well now you don t say protested the sheriff In magazines And his eye quested through the group hoping for other listeners who might learn how broadly the fame of their sheriff was spread That Canning fellow who travelled out West and ran into you and was along while you were hunting down the Garrison boys I read his article The sheriff scratched his chin I disremember him Canning Canning Come to think of it I do remember him Kind of a small man with washed out eyes Always with a notebook on his knee I got sick of answering all that gent s questions I recollect Yep he was along when I took the Garrison boys but that little party didn t amount to much He thought it did said Terry fervently Said it was the bravest coolest headed cunningest piece of work he d ever seen done Perhaps you ll tell me some of the other things the things you count big Oh I ain t done nothing much come to think of it All pretty simple they looked to me when I was doing them Besides I ain t much of a hand at talk Ah said Terry you d talk well enough to suit me sheriff The sheriff had found a listener after his own heart They ain t nothing but a campfire that gives a good light to see a story by the kind of stories I got to tell he declared Some of these days I ll take you along with me on a trail son if you d like and most like I ll talk your arm off at night beside the fire Like to come Like to cried Terry I d be the happiest man in the mountains Would you now Well Colby you and me might hit it off pretty well I ve heard tell you ain t half bad with a rifle and pretty slick with a revolver too I practice hard said Terry frankly I love guns Good things to love and good things to hate too philosophized the sheriff But all right in their own place which ain t none too big these days The old times is gone when a man went out into the world with a hoss under him and a pair of Colts strapped to his waist and made his own way Them days is gone and our younger boys is going to pot I suppose so admitted Terry But you got a spark in you son Well one of these days we ll get together And I hear tell you got El Sangre I was lucky said Terry That s a sizable piece of work Colby I ve seen twenty that run El Sangre and never even got close enough to eat his dust Nacheral pacer right enough I ve seen him kite across country like a train And his mane and tail blowing like smoke I got him with patience That was all S pose we take a look at him By all means Just come along with me Elizabeth struck in Just a moment Terence There s Mr Gainor and he s been asking to see you You can take the sheriff out to see El Sangre later Besides half a dozen people want to talk to the sheriff and you mustn t monopolize him Miss Wickson begged me to get her a chance to talk to you the real Sheriff Minter Do you mind Pshaw said the sheriff I ain t no kind of a hand at talking to the womenfolk Where is she Down yonder sheriff Shall we go The old lady with the cane No the girl with the bright hair Doggone me muttered the sheriff Well let s saunter down that way He waved to Terence who casting a black glance in the direction of Mr Gainor
