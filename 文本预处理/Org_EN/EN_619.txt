By eleven o clock we had all the basement cleaned except the one cow stall that was filled to the ceiling with litter and Winnie had washed the windows Then John Jones s lank figure darkened the doorway and he cried Hello neighbor what ye drivin at Look around and see and then tell us where to get a lot of chickens Well I declare How you ve slicked things up You re not goin to scrub the dirt floor are you Well well this looks like business just the place for chickens Wonder old man Jamison didn t keep em here but he didn t care for fowls Now I think of it there s to be a vandoo the first of the week and there was a lot o chickens printed on the poster I smiled Oh I don t mean that the chickens themselves was on the poster but a statement that a lot would be sold at auction I ll bid em in for you if they re a good lot If you a city chap was to bid some straw bidder would raise em agin you I know what they re wuth and everybody there ll know I do and they ll try no sharp games with me That will suit me exactly Mr Jones I don t want any game fowls of that kind Ha ha I see the p int Have you looked into the root cellar Yes we opened the door and looked but it was dark as a pocket Well I don t b lieve in matches around a barn but I ll show you something and he opened the door struck a match and holding it aloft revealed a heap of turnips another of carrots five barrels of potatoes and three of apples The children pounced upon the last with appetites sharpened by their morning s work You see resumed Mr Jones these were here when old man Jamison died If I hadn t sold the place I should have taken them out before long and got rid of what I didn t want Now you can have the lot at a low figure which he named I ll take them I said promptly The carrots make it look like a gold mine cried Merton Well you re wise resumed Mr Jones You ll have to get a cow and a horse and here s fodder for em handy Perhaps I can pick em out for you too at the vandoo You can go along and if anything strikes your fancy I ll bid on it O papa cried the children in chorus can we go with you to the vandoo Yes I think so When does the sale take place Next Tuesday That s a good breed of potatoes Jamison allus had the best of everything They ll furnish you with seed and supply your table till new ones come I guess you could sell a barrel or so of apples at a rise I ve found a market for them already Look at these children and I m good for half a barrel myself if they don t decay too soon Where could we find better or cheaper food All the books say that apples are fattening That s true of man and beast if the books do say it They ll keep in this cool dark cellar longer than you d think longer than you ll let em from the way they re disappearin I guess I ll try one Certainly a dozen just as if they were still yours They wasn t mine they belonged to the Jamison estate I ll help myself now quicker n I would before I might come it over a live man you know but not a dead one I d trust you with either While I was laughing at this phase of honesty he resumed This is the kind of place to keep apples cool dry dark even temperature Why they re as crisp and juicy as if just off the trees I came over to make a suggestion There s a lot of sugar maple trees on your place down by the brook Why not tap em and set a couple of pots b ilin over your open fire You d kill two birds with one stone the fire d keep you warm and make a lot of sugar in the bargain I opinion too the children would like the fun They were already shouting over the idea but I said dubiously How about the pails to catch the sap Well said Mr Jones I ve thought of that We ve a lot of spare milk pails and pans that we re not usin Junior understands the business and as we re not very busy he can help you and take his pay in sugar The subject of poultry was forgotten and the children scampered off to the house to tell of this new project Before Mr Jones and I left the basement he said You don t want any partition here at present only a few perches for the fowls There s a fairish shed you remember in the upper barnyard and when tain t very cold or stormy the cow will do well enough there from this out The weather ll be growin milder most every day and in rough spells you can put her in here Chickens won t do her any harm Law sakes when the main conditions is right what s the use of havin everything jes so It s more important to save your time and strength and money You ll find enough to do without one stroke that ain t needful Thus John Jones fulfilled his office of mentor lank adj He
