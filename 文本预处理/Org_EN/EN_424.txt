The two figures amid the rows of the marked garden paused in the enveloping dusk and leaned on their hoes and listened a low peevish whistle like the call of a night jar on the plain came to them Presently the call repeated itself three wavering notes and they shouldered their hoes and moved toward the little house The old man emerged from the gloom coming toward them What was it asked one of the figures quickly The old man chuckled Stole a racer that s about all they knew you got off easy He was peering toward them The larger of the two figures straightened itself I am sick of it I tell you my back s broke He moved himself in the dusk stretching out his great arms and looking about him vaguely The old man eyed him shrewdly You re earning a good pile he said Yes one seventy five a day The man laughed a little The other man had not spoken He slipped forward through the dusk Supper ready he asked They followed him into the house stopping in an entry to wash their hands and remove their heavy shoes Through the door opening to a room beyond a woman could be seen moving briskly and the smell of cooking floated out They sniffed at it hungrily The woman came to the door Hurry up boys everything s done to death They came in hastily with half dried hands and she looked at them a laugh in her round keen face You have had a day she said She was tall and angular and her face had a sudden roundness a kind of motherly Dutch doll set on its high lean frame Her body moved in soft jerks She heaped up the plates with quick hands and watched the men while they ate For a time no one spoke The old man went to the cellar and brought up a great mug of beer and they filled their pipes and sat smoking and sipping the beer stolidly The windows were open to the air and the shades were up Any one passing on the long road over the plain might look in on them The woman toasted a piece of bread and moistened it with a little milk and put it with a glass of milk on a small tray The men s eyes followed her indifferent They watched her lift the tray and carry it to a door at the back of the room and disappear They smoked on in silence The old man reached out for his glass He lifted it Two weeks and three more days he said He sipped the beer slowly The larger of the two men nodded He had dark regular features and reddish hair He looked heavy and tired He opened his lips vaguely Don t talk here said the younger man sharply and he gave a quick glance at the room as a weasel returns to cover in a narrow place The big man smiled I wa n t going to say anything Better not said the other He cleared his pipe with his little finger I don t even think he added softly The woman had come back with the tray and the men looked up smoking She set the tray down by the sink and came over to them standing with both hands on her high hips She regarded them gravely and glanced at the tray The milk and toast were untouched The old man removed his pipe and looked at her plaintively Can t ye make her Lena he said His high voice had a shrill note She shook her head I can t do anything not anything more She moved away and began to gather up the dishes from the table clearing it with swift jerks She paused a moment and leaned over the platter in her hand half lifted from its place She needs the air she said and to run about she s sick shut up like that She lifted the platter and carried it to the sink a troubled look in her eyes I won t be responsible for her not much longer she said slowly as she set it down not if she doesn t get down in the air The men looked at each other in silence The old man got up Time to go to bed he said slowly They filed out of the room The woman s eyes followed them Presently the door opened and the younger man returned with soft quick steps He looked at her I want to talk he said In a minute she replied She nodded toward the cellar The lantern s down there you go along He opened the door and stepped cautiously into blackness and she heard a quick scratching match on the plaster behind the closed door and his feet descending the stairs She drew forward the kettle on the stove and replenished the fire and blew out the hand lamp on the table Then she groped her way to the cellar door opening it with noiseless touch The young man waited below impatient On a huge barrel near by the lantern cast a yellow circle on the blackness The woman approached it her high stepping figure flung in shadowy movement along the wall behind her You can t back out now He spoke quickly You re weakening And you ve got to brace up do you hear The woman s round face smiled over the light on the barrel I m all right she said She hesitated a minute It s the child that s not all right she added slowly And tonight I got scared yes She waited a breath What s the matter he said roughly She waited again She wasn t like flesh and blood to night she said slowly I felt as if a breath would blow her out She drew her hand quickly across her eyes I ve got fond of the little thing John I can t seem to have her hurt Who s hurting her said the man sharply You take care of her and she s all right I can t John She needs the outdoors She s like a little bird up there shut up Then let her out said the man savagely Let her out up there His lifted hand pointed to the plain about them in open scorn He leaned forward and spoke more persuasively close to her ear We can t back out now he said the child knows too much He gave the barrel beside them a significant tap We couldn t use this plant again six years digging it and waiting and starving He struck the barrel sharply I tell you we ve got to put it through You keep her out of sight Her own mother wouldn t know her said the woman slowly He met the look and waited I tell you I ve done everything she said with quick passion I ve fed her and amused her and told her stories I don t dare keep her any longer She touched the barrel beside them I tell you you might as well put her under that You ll put her under for good if you don t look out she said significantly All right said the man sullenly what do you want She was smiling again the round keen smile on its high frame Let her breathe a bit like a child and run out in the sun The sun will cure her she added quickly All right if you take the risk a hundred thousand dollars and your own daughter thrown to the devil if we lose You know that I know that John I want the money more than you want it She spoke with quick fierce loyalty I d give my life for Mollie or to keep her straight but I can t kill a child to keep her straight not this child to keep her straight Her queer round face worked against the yellow light He looked at it half contemptuously and turned to the barrel See if everything s all right he said If we re going to take risks we ve got to be ready The woman lifted the lantern and he pushed against the barrel It yielded to his weight the upper part turning slowly on a pivot Something inside swashed against the sides as it turned The man bent over the hole and peered in He stepped down cautiously feeling with his foot and disappearing inch by inch into the opening The woman held the light above him looking down with quick tense eyes a hand reached up to her out of the hole beckoning for the lantern and she knelt down guiding it toward the waving fingers A sound of something creaking a hinge half turned caught her breath and she leaned forward blowing at the lantern She got quickly to her feet and groped for the swinging barrel turning it swiftly over the hole the liquid chugged softly against its side and stopped Her breath listened up into the darkness The door above creaked again softly and a shuffling foot groped at the stair You down there Lena called an old voice She laughed out softly moving toward the stair Go to bed father What you doing down there asked the old voice in the darkness Testing the barrel said the woman John s gone down She came to the foot of the stair You go to bed father You better come to bed all of ye grumbled the old man We re coming in a minute She heard his hand fumble at the door and it creaked again softly and closed She groped her way back
