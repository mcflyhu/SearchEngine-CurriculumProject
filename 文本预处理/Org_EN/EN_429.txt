The child lay with her hands clasped breathing lightly The sound of voices came drowsily from the kitchen she must not go to sleep She sat up and leaned toward the little window that looked out to the north Through the blackness the stars twinkled mistily and she put her foot carefully over the edge of the bed and slipped down The window was open as far as the small sash allowed and a warm faint breeze came across the plain to her She leaned against the sill looking out It was not far to the ground But she could see only vague blackness down there and she looked again up to the twinkling stars They were little points of light up there and she looked up trustfully while the warm wind blew against her Her heart was beating very hard and fast but she was not afraid Mr Achilles had said not to be afraid and he was waiting down there in the blackness to take her home She crept back to bed and lay down very still In the room below there was a scraping of chairs and louder words and footsteps Someone had opened the door under her window and the smell of tobacco came up Her little nose disdained it and listened alert Footsteps went out into the night and moved a little away on the gravel and came back and the door closed She could hear the bolt click to its place and the footsteps shuffle along the hall The voices below had ceased and the house was still she was very sleepy now But he had said Mr Achilles had said She winked briskly and gave herself a little pinch under the clothes and sat up It was a sharp little pinch through many thicknesses of clothes Under the coarse nightgown buttoned carefully to the throat she was still wearing the red and green plaids and all her day clothes Only the clumsy shoes slipped off stood by the bed waiting for her Her hand reached down to them cautiously and felt them and she lay down and closed her eyes There was a step on the stairs coming slowly Betty Harris grew very still If Mrs Seabury came in and stood and looked at her she must cry out and throw her arms around her neck and tell her everything She could not hurt Mrs Seabury Mr Achilles had said they would not hurt her She had asked him that three times herself and Mr Achilles had said it no one should hurt Mrs Seabury if Betty went away She held her breath The footsteps had come across the room to her door they waited there then they moved on and she drew a free breath Her heart thumped to the vague movements that came and went in the next room they pottered about a little and finally ceased and a light indrawn breath blew out the lamp a hand was groping for the handle of her door and opening it softly and the bare feet moved away The bed springs in the next room creaked a little and everything was still Betty Harris had a quick sense of pain Mrs Seabury was kind to her She had been so kind that first day when they brought her in out of the hot sun and she had stumbled on the stairs and sobbed out Mrs Seabury had picked her up and carried her up the stairs and comforted her and told her what it meant these strange harsh men seizing her in the open sunshine as they swept past covering her mouth with hard hands and hurrying her out of the city to this stifling place She loved Mrs Seabury Perhaps they would put her in prison and never let her out and Mollie would not get well The child gave a little quick sob in her thought and lay very still Mollie had been good once and wicked men had hurt her and now her mother could not help her But Mr Achilles said yes he said it no one should hurt her And with the thought of the Greek she lay in the darkness listening to the sounds of the night There was a long light call somewhere across the plain a train of heavy Pullmans pushing through the night the sound came to the child like a whiff of breath and passed away and the crickets chirped high and shrill In the next room the breathing grew loud and louder in long even beats Mrs Seabury was asleep Betty Harris sat up in bed her little hands clinched fast at her side Then she lay down again and waited and the breathing in the next room grew loud and regular and full Mrs Seabury was very tired And Betty Harris listened and slipped down from the bed and groped for her shoes and lifted them like a breath and stepped high across the floor in the dim room It was a slow flight tuned to the long drawn falling breath of the sleeper that did not break by a note not even when the brown hand released the latch and a little sharp click fell on the air Wake up Mrs Seabury Wake up for Mollie s sake wake up the latch said But the sleeper did not stir only the long regular dream filled droning sleep And the child crept down the stair across the kitchen and reached the other door She was not afraid now one more door The men would not hear her they were asleep Mrs Seabury was asleep and her fingers turned the key softly and groped to the bolt above and pushed at it hard and fell back and groped for it again and tugged little beads of sweat were coming on the brown forehead She drew the back of her hand swiftly across them and reached again to the bolt It was too high she could reach it but not to push She felt for a chair in the darkness and lifted it without a sound and carried it to the door and climbed up There was a great lump in her throat now Mr Achilles did not know the bolt would stick like this she gave a fierce soft tug like a sob and it slid back The knob turned and the door opened and she was in the night For a moment her eyes groped with the blackness Then a long quiet hand reached out to her and closed upon her and she gave a little sob and was drawn swiftly into the night drowsily adv She turned drowsily on her side a slow creeping blackness enveloping her mind I felt asleep drowsily
