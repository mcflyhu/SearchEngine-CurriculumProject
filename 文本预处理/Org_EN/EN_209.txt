We turned off through the shrubbery and went out by the side gate along the bypath to the links Ranny walked behind absolutely silent till he burst out May I smoke When he had lit a cigarette I glanced back I thought he looked a shade less miserable I could see the four figures standing out against the house and still no sign anywhere of Eric I asked Ranny if he was to be one of the yachting party Lord no Perhaps they had not asked him Maybe that was it I said something about how we should miss Hermione Er yes he said I suppose you will and I noticed his voice was steadier Don t be ungrateful I said So will you Me Then as I reproached him he said Oh yes awfully nice people the Helmstones I used to be rather fond of Lady Helmstone But she s a[Pg ] woman who doesn t know how to take No That s partly why I came I looked back again Is that the only reason Well she kept writing and making out in spite of what I d said that she was expecting me to join them at Marseilles And had put off somebody else who wanted to go If I backed out I had never backed in I would be breaking up the party and behaving like the devil He spoke more ill temperedly than I had ever heard him How will it end I asked End I m hanged if I ll go I ve told her I wouldn t from the beginning But I only convinced her yesterday We walked on They ve asked Betty I said No He caught me up and walked at my side When did they do that Yesterday evening Is Betty going No I said And very sharp on that Why not he asked Doesn t she want to She doesn t know anything about it My[Pg ] mother doesn t want her to go And while he fell into silence again I sent my eyes about the heath No sign Suddenly I remembered Betty s find out I had not found out I hadn t even tried and I realised myself for a monster of selfishness thinking Eric Eric and nothing but Eric the livelong day I pulled myself together and asked Ranny what he had been doing since Christmas Since New Year s Eve you mean He frowned and threw away a cigarette half smoked and lit another When he had puffed and frowned a little more he said he had been going through a ghastly experience with a great friend of his Not a bad chap on the whole he said in a hesitating almost appealing voice But this not bad chap had got himself badly bunkered Ranny hesitated and then Yes I ve been thinking I d tell you about it and see if if you thought I ve advised him right The friend he said had been one of a house party at a place up in Norfolk He d gone for the fag end of the shooting Last month it was Beastly dull people Awful good shooting as a rule But the weather[Pg ] was rotten All shut up together in that beastly dull house Nothing earthly to do except rag and you know the kind of thing I didn t know a bit but I said I did Well his friend had nothing to do and he got it into his head that the girl of the house rather liked him And there wasn t another blessed thing to do so Oh well they got engaged He waited for a moment and then he said that when his friend went back to Aldershot he found he wasn t any more in love with that girl than he was with the cat It was all just a beastly mistake So he got leave and went home to think it out Couldn t think it out Felt he d better go and talk it over with somebody Ranny hesitated again Awful hole to be in isn t it I agreed it must have been very dreadful for his friend to have to tell the girl he d made a mistake Oh but he couldn t do that With a shocked look Ranny stopped dead for a second Then as he went on he said that he had told his friend of course he d have to go through with it You don t mean I said that when he was[Pg ] feeling like that you think he ought to let the poor girl marry him He said I didn t see the point It would probably spoil the girl s life if his friend drew back I said he would spoil her life if he didn t draw back Ranny looked merely bewildered Oh but then he caught hold of a mainstay my friend he isn t a cad you know A man can t back out of a thing like that Then I told him without the names about Guy Whitby Dawson Guy had backed out Guy had made up his mind to the sacrifice of running in single harness and had said so frankly I praised him Naturally Ranny answered if people hadn t enough money to marry nobody would expect them to marry But in the case I m talking about he said gloomily the man my friend is an eldest son He is going to have oh it s rotten luck I asked him if he really thought that not to have enough money to keep house on was worse than not to have enough love to keep house on He said that what he thought wasn t the question [Pg ] The question was what the girl would think And what the girl s family would think I asked how anybody was to know what the girl would think unless she was asked Ranny gave his rough head a despairing shake Of course I couldn t tell him half of what I felt about that girl but I kept seeing her Very happy Never dreaming what her lover was feeling I saw them going up the church aisle to be married All the smiling and congratulating afterwards I saw them going away And I felt sick But I did try to make him feel a little for the girl He said that feeling for the girl was precisely what had decided the business The girl couldn t be told the truth She ll guess it But that didn t comfort him as I had expected Even if she guesses she couldn t be expected to release m my friend Why Because said Ranny with his childlike air because she ll probably never have as good an offer again I was conscious of an inner fury when he said[Pg ] that I turned on him And all of a sudden quite curiously my feeling changed His face showed not only utter innocence of any arrogance the expression on it was of great misery And this was so at odds with the roundness and the hint of dimples the roughened hair that the damp air had begun to curl that as I looked at him I felt the queer stirring at the heart sort of softness perhaps only women know when they catch a glimpse in some man s face of the child that died when he grew up I could see just what Ranny had been like when he was in short dresses Full of laughter as he was still when we first knew him And in face of those earlier bumps and bruises just this bewilderment overmastering the pain of the baby who is outraged at the disproportion between desert and reward the baby who thinks if he doesn t say I never did a single thing and here all this has tumbled down on my head In that instant I saw how lovable Ranny Dallas was and instead of reproaching him I found myself saying If that s true what you say it is very horrible for the girl but I see it is probably nearly as horrible for the man [Pg ] And Ranny sat down on the wet heather under a gorse bush and buried his face in his hands Get up I said here
