The copying was a weary business the more so as I perceived very early there was no sort of urgency in the matters treated and began very early to consider my employment a pretext I had no sooner finished than I got to horse used what remained of daylight to the best purpose and being at last fairly benighted slept in a house by Almond Water side I was in the saddle again before the day and the Edinburgh booths were just opening when I clattered in by the West Bow and drew up a smoking horse at my lord Advocate s door I had a written word for Doig my lord s private hand that was thought to be in all his secrets a worthy little plain man all fat and snuff and self sufficiency Him I found already at his desk and already bedabbled with maccabaw in the same anteroom where I rencountered with James More He read the note scrupulously through like a chapter in his Bible H m says he ye come a wee thing ahint hand Mr Balfour The bird s flaen we hae letten her out Miss Drummond is set free I cried [pg ] Achy said he What would we keep her for ye ken To hae made a steer about the bairn would hae pleased naebody And where ll she be now says I Gude kens says Doig with a shrug She ll have gone home to Lady Allardyce I m thinking said I That ll be it said he Then I ll gang there straight says I But ye ll be for a bite or ye go said he Neither bite nor sup said I I had a good waucht of milk in by Ratho Aweel aweel says Doig But ye ll can leave your horse here and your bags for it seems we re to have your up put Na na said I Tamson s mear[ ] would never be the thing for me this day of all days Doig speaking somewhat broad I had been led by imitation into an accent much more countrified than I was usually careful to affect a good deal broader indeed than I have written it down and I was the more ashamed when another voice joined in behind me with a scrap of a ballad Gae saddle me the bonny black Gae saddle sune and mak him ready For I will down the Gatehope slack And a to see my bonny leddy [pg ]The young lady when I turned to her stood in a morning gown and her hands muffled in the same as if to hold me at a distance Yet I could not but think there was kindness in the eye with which she saw me My best respects to you Mistress Grant said I bowing The like to yourself Mr David she replied with a deep courtesy And I beg to remind you of an old musty saw that meat and mass never hindered man The mass I cannot afford you for we are all good Protestants But the meat I press on your attention And I would not wonder but I could find something for your private ear that would be worth the stopping for Mistress Grant said I I believe I am already your debtor for some merry words and I think they were kind too on a piece of unsigned paper Unsigned paper says she and made a droll face which was likewise wondrous beautiful as of one trying to remember Or else I am the more deceived I went on But to be sure we shall have the time to speak of these since your father is so good as to make me for a while your inmate and the gomeral begs you at this time only for the favour of his liberty You give yourself hard names said she Mr Doig and I would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen says I Once more I have to admire the discretion of all [pg ]men folk she replied But if you will not eat off with you at once you will be back the sooner for you go on a fool s errand Off with you Mr David she continued opening the door He has lowpen on his bonny grey He rade the richt gate and the ready I trow he would neither stint nor stay Far he was seeking his bonny leddy I did not wait to be twice bidden and did justice to Miss Grant s citation on the way to Dean Old Lady Allardyce walked there alone in the garden in her hat and mutch and having a silver mounted staff of some black wood to lean upon As I alighted from my horse and drew near to her with congees I could see the blood come in her face and her head fling into the air like what I had conceived of empresses What brings you to my poor door she cried speaking high through her nose I cannot bar it The males of my house are dead and buried I have neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me any beggar can pluck me by the baird[ ] and a baird there is and that s the worst of it yet she added partly to herself I was extremely put out at this reception and the last remark which seemed like a daft wife s left me near hand speechless [pg ] I see I have fallen under your displeasure ma am said I Yet I will still be so bold as ask after Mistress Drummond She considered me with a burning eye her lips pressed close together into twenty creases her hand shaking on her staff This cows all she cried Ye come to me to spier for her Would God I knew She is not here I cried She threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me so that I fell back incontinent Out upon your leeing throat she cried What ye come and spier at me She s in jyle whaur ye took her to that s all there is to it And of a the beings ever I beheld in breeks to think it should be you Ye timmer scoun rel if I had a male left to my name I would have your jaicket dustit till ye raired I thought it not good to delay longer in that place because I remarked her passion to be rising As I turned to the horse post she even followed me and I make no shame to confess that I rode away with the one stirrup on and scrambling for the other As I knew no other quarter where I could push my inquiries there was nothing left me but to return to the Advocate s I was well received by the four ladies who were now in company together and must give the news of Prestongrange and what word went in the west country at the most inordinate length and with great [pg ]weariness to myself while all the time that young lady with whom I so much desired to be alone again observed me quizzically and seemed to find pleasure in the sight of my impatience At last after I had endured a meal with them and was come very near the point of appealing for an interview before her aunt she went and stood by the music case and picking out a tune sang to it on a high key He that will not when he may When he will he shall have nay But this was the end of her rigours and presently after making some excuse of which I have no mind she carried me away in private to her father s library I should not fail to say that she was dressed to the nines and appeared extraordinary handsome Now Mr David sit ye down here and let us have a two handed crack said she For I have much to tell you and it appears besides that I have been grossly unjust to your good taste In what manner Mistress Grant I asked I trust I have never seemed to fail in due respect I will be your surety Mr David said she Your respect whether to yourself or your poor neighbours has been always and most fortunately beyond imitation But that is by the question You got a note from me she asked I was so bold as to suppose so upon inference said I and it was kindly thought upon It must have prodigiously surprised you said she [pg ] But let us begin with the beginning You have not perhaps forgot a day when you were so kind as to escort three very tedious misses to Hope Park I have the less cause to forget it myself because you was so particular obliging as to introduce me to some of the principles of the Latin grammar a thing which wrote itself profoundly on my gratitude I fear I was sadly pedantical said I overcome with confusion at the memory You are only to consider I am quite unused with the society of ladies I will say the less about the grammar then she replied But how came you to desert your charge He has thrown her out overboard his ain dear Annie she hummed and his ain dear Annie and her two sisters had to taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese It seems you returned to my papa s where you showed yourself excessively martial and then on to realms unknown with an eye it appears to the Bass Rock solan geese being perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses Through all this raillery there was something indulgent in the lady s eye which made me suppose there might be better coming You take a pleasure to torment me said I and I make a very feckless plaything but let me ask you to be more merciful At this time there is but the one thing that I care to hear of and that will be news of Catriona [pg ] Do you call her by that name to her face Mr Balfour she asked In troth and I am not very sure I stammered I would not do so in any case to strangers said Miss Grant And why are you so much immersed in the affairs of this young lady I heard she was in prison said I Well and now you hear that she is out of it she replied and what more would you have She has no need of any further champion I may have the greater need of her ma am said I Come this is better says Miss Grant But look me fairly in the face am I not bonnier than she I would be the last to be denying it said I There is not your marrow in all Scotland Well here you have the pick of the two at your hand and must needs speak of the other said she This is never the way to please the ladies Mr Balfour But mistress said I there are surely other things besides mere beauty By which I am to understand that I am no better than I should be perhaps she asked By which you will please understand that I am like the cock in the midden in the fable book said I I see the braw jewel and I like fine to see it too but I have more need of the pickle corn [pg ] Bravissimo she cried There is a word well said at last and I will reward you for it with my story That same night of your desertion I came late from a friend s house where I was excessively admired whatever you may think of it and what should I hear but that a lass in a tartan screen desired to speak with me She had been there an hour or better said the servant lass and she grat in to herself as she sat waiting I went to her direct she rose as I came in and I knew her at a look Grey Eyes says I to myself but was more wise than to let on You will be Miss Grant at last she says rising and looking at me hard and pitiful Ay it was true he said you are bonny at all events The way God made me my dear I said but I would be gey and obliged if ye could tell me what brought you here at such a time of the night Lady she said we are kinsfolk we are both come of the blood of the sons of Alpin My dear I replied I think no more of Alpin or his sons than what I do of a kale stock You have a better argument in these tears upon your bonny face And at that I was so weakminded as to kiss her which is what you would like to do dearly and I wager will never find the courage of I say it was weakminded of me for I knew no more of her than the outside but it was the wisest stroke I could have hit upon She is a very staunch brave nature but I think she has been little used with tenderness and at that caress though to say the truth it was but [pg ]lightly given her heart went out to me I will never betray the secrets of my sex Mr Davie I will never tell you the way she turned me round her thumb because it is the same she will use to twist yourself Ay it is a fine lass She is as clean as hill well water She is e en t I cried Well then she told me her concerns pursued Miss Grant and in what a swither she was in about her papa and what a taking about yourself with very little cause and in what a perplexity she had found herself after you was gone away And then I minded at long last says she that we were kinswomen and that Mr David should have given you the name of the bonniest of the bonny and I was thinking to myself If she is so bonny she will be good at all events and I took up my foot soles out of that That was when I forgave yourself Mr Davie When you was in my society you seemed upon hot iron by all marks if ever I saw a young man that wanted to be gone it was yourself and I and my two sisters were the ladies you were so desirous to be gone from and now it appeared you had given me some notice in the bygoing and was so kind as to comment on my attractions From that hour you may date our friendship and I began to think with tenderness upon the Latin grammar You will have many hours to rally me in said I and I think besides you do yourself injustice I think [pg ]it was Catriona turned your heart in my direction she is too simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of her friend I would not like to wager upon that Mr David said she The lasses have clear eyes But at least she is your friend entirely as I was to see I carried her in to his lordship my papa and his Advocacy being in a favourable stage of claret was so good as to receive the pair of us Here is Grey Eyes that you have been deaved with these days past said I she is come to prove that we spoke true and I lay the prettiest lass in the three Lothians at your feet making a papistical reservation of myself She suited her action to my words down she went upon her knees to him I would not like to swear but he saw two of her which doubtless made her appeal the more irresistible for you are all a pack of Mahomedans told him what had passed that night and how she had withheld her father s man from following of you and what a case she was in about her father and what a flutter for yourself and begged with weeping for the lives of both of you neither of which was in the slightest danger till I vow I was proud of my sex because it was done so pretty and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the occasion She had not gone far I assure you before the Advocate was wholly sober to see his inmost politics ravelled out by a young lass and discovered to the most unruly of his daughters But we took him in [pg ]hand the pair of us and brought that matter straight Properly managed and that means managed by me there is no one to compare with my papa He has been a good man to me said I Well he was a good man to Katrine and I was there to see to it said she And she pled for me said I She did that and very movingly said Miss Grant I would not like to tell you what she said I find you vain enough already God reward her for it cried I With Mr David Balfour I suppose says she You do me too much injustice at the last I cried I would tremble to think of her in such hard hands Do you think I would presume because she begged my life She would do that for a new whelped puppy I have had more than that to set me up if you but ken d She kissed that hand of mine Ay but she did And why because she thought I was playing a brave part and might be going to my death It was not for my sake but I need not be telling that to you that cannot look at me without laughter It was for the love of what she thought was bravery I believe there is none but me and poor Prince Charlie had that honour done them Was this not to make a god of me and do you not think my heart would quake when I remember it I do laugh at you a good deal and a good deal [pg ]more than is quite civil said she but I will tell you one thing if you speak to her like that you have some glimmerings of a chance Me I cried I would never dare I can speak to you Miss Grant because it s a matter of indifference what ye think of me But her no fear said I I think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland says she Troth they are no very small said I looking down Ah poor Catriona cried Miss Grant And I could but stare upon her for though I now see very well what she was driving at and perhaps some justification for the same I was never swift at the uptake in such flimsy talk Ah well Mr David she said it goes sore against my conscience but I see I shall have to be your speaking board She shall know you came to her straight upon the news of her imprisonment she shall know you would not pause to eat and of your conversation she shall hear just so much as I think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience Believe me you will be in that way much better served than you could serve yourself for I will keep the big feet out of the platter You know where she is then I exclaimed That I do Mr David and will never tell said she [pg ] Why that I asked Well she said I am a good friend as you will soon discover and the chief of those that I am a friend to is my papa I assure you you will never heat nor melt me out of that so you may spare me your sheep s eyes and adieu to your David Balfourship for the now But there is yet one thing more I cried There is one thing that must be stopped being mere ruin to herself and to me too Well she said be brief I have spent half the day on you already My Lady Allardyce believes I began she supposes she thinks that I abducted her The colour came into Miss Grant s face so that at first I was quite abashed to find her ear so delicate till I bethought me she was struggling rather with mirth a notion in which I was altogether confirmed by the shaking of her voice as she replied I will take up the defence of your reputation
