Bettina came into the room and handed me a letter Mrs Harborough my mother drew herself up on the pillow with an animation I had not thought to see again I opened and read My dear niece Ah my mother brought out the ejaculation with an effect of having doubted if the relationship would be owned That introductory phrase turned out to be the most comprehensible part of the first half of Aunt Josephine s letter As for me I was completely floored by the Dynamism of Mind after I had stumbled over a cryptic reference to my mother s state which you must not expect me to call sickness There is no such thing There is only harmony or unharmony whether of the so called body or the soul On the third page the writer descended[Pg ] from these Alpine heights to say that it had been inspirationally borne in upon her that the time was come for her brother s daughters to widen their horizon and incidentally to see something of their father s world The implied slur upon our mother s world was to my surprise not resented Go on Go on The letter ended by saying that in spite of very grave and urgent preoccupations Aunt Josephine would endeavour to draw a little of the old life round her if her nieces would come and stay with her in Lowndes Square for a few weeks A London season Bettina cried I looked up from the letter and saw my mother watching with hungry delight Bettina s face of rapture Bettina had not looked like that since the Helmstones went away But the most marked change after all was in my mother herself When Eric came he was staggered I ll believe in miracles after this and we joked about the Dynamism of Mind My mother had taken for granted that both Bettina and I would accept Aunt Josephine s invitation [Pg ] though I said at once I could not leave home My mother put this aside with Bettina go alone A wild idea When the question came up again in Eric s presence I did not press it far But going downstairs I asked him how was I to put it to my mother Put what he asked Why the fact that we can t leave her Or at least that I can t I agreed Betty must go So must you he said My heart beat faster His villeggiatura was near the end London for me meant Eric You need the change he said more than Betty does You forget I said a little sadly what we ve been facing here The specialist coming Well he will find she has rallied Nevertheless she was in no condition Eric said to be crossed Had she not told me herself that my first duty was to take care of Betty That was not how he would put it all the same the change would do me good Then a word about our trustworthy servants In any event I was[Pg ] not to say any more about not going till we had seen the London chap She went on quite wonderfully We were positively gay again she and I and Bettina the three of us laying plans We talked about clothes and planned how we should look very nice on very little money When the great specialist came he found my mother sitting up in a bed covered with old evening gowns old laces and embroidered muslins things she had worn long ago in India and which should help to make us brave for our first London season Smart little blouses morning gowns and afternoon gowns could be made in the house or in the village But who was worthy to make an evening frock fit for London My mother was much more concerned about this than about the great specialist whom she received rather as a friend of Eric s He echoed all that Eric had said My mother had made me write to Aunt Josephine on the evening of the same day that brought her letter I did not tell anyone but I put off[Pg ] posting my answer till the London doctor had gone My letter was not only thanks and acceptance I felt I ought in common civility to try to make some more or less intelligent rejoinder to the odd part of my aunt s letter And this modest effort seemed not to displease her For she replied in eight pages of cloudy metaphysic and a highly lucid cheque The cheque alone supported us in our attempt to grapple with those eight bewildering pages The first introduced us by way of the Psychology of the Solar Plexus to the Self Superlative If this view point interests you I will later explain to you in terms of inclusiveness and totalism the mystical activities of the Ever Creative Self Isn t she awfully learned said Bettina in a scared voice On your return home having contacted as we say the talents and the tranquillity of others instead of contacting things of lack and fear you will be able to think happily and sweetly about matters that formerly disturbed you All the ills of life are curable from within Complete health is wisdom I do not go so far as to predict[Pg ] that you will find yourself instantly able to adopt the bio vibratory sympathism which habitualises thought to the Majesty of Choice But I do say that after giving the deeper and sweeter Self a chance to unite the self of common consciousness constructively with the Powers Within that you too may find yourself a Healer that is Harmoniser clothed in the Regal Now After that plunge Aunt Josephine came to the surface for breath so to speak and to say that she thought it only fair to tell us that she herself had seen almost nothing of general society for the past ten years She had her work She had her classes in which we might take some interest I was to tell the musical one that Self Expression through voice culture and pianoforte playing was one of the Keys to the Biosophian System Aunt Josephine had already taken opera tickets for the season And we should go to as many concerts as we liked We should see pictures and we should see people We should learn to use the plus sign in thought We should recognise the cosmic truth that all is good This concluding phrase was underscored three times And still despite its provokingly obvious aspect I felt that I had not a notion what Aunt[Pg ] Josephine meant by it My mother said the reason was that I knew nothing of mysticism Eric said neither did he But he knew stark staring lunacy when he saw it And he was more than doubtful if we ought to be entrusted to this demented step aunt My mother reproved Eric s flippancy Either she really did see daylight and most excellent meaning in the Biosophical Theory or she concerned herself to make out a case for the defence of Aunt Josephine She told Eric she was surprised that a man of science should at this time of the day cast ridicule on the doctrine of an essential harmony between soul states and the health of the body For her part she felt the attraction of this idea of ceasing the little lonely personal fight against overwhelming odds this putting oneself into direct relation with the Infinite Eric stared Yes my mother maintained there was much to be said for Mrs Harborough s idea that each individual should learn to think of his life in connection with this underlying force If instead of denying God we affirmed Him refusing to accept or to believe in evil [Pg ] All very jolly for us Eric said but what about the poor cancerous devils in our hospital I see us looking in on them and saying Oh you re all right Three cheers for harmony Come out and play golf with the staff After Eric had gone my mother lay back on the pillow her shining eyes on Bettina pirouetting noiselessly about the room I begged Bettina to stop her gyrating She explained she was doing the cheque dance Mercifully there was this antidote I mean postscript to Aunt Josephine s letter Nearer the time she would send us the money for our tickets The enclosed was for clothes Now the way was clear No The question still was Who this side of London could be trusted to make our frocks The seriousness of the consideration brought the cheque dance to an end We sat and thought The precise date of this visit was not yet fixed Aunt Josephine had asked what time would suit us best [Pg ] With one voice Betty and I cried June But we were promptly told and we agreed that to suggest June would be too grasping Aunt Josephine would have other more important guests eager to come to her for the Coronation month So we answered Any time convenient to her Then that admirable Aunt wrote back Would next month do And would we stay for the Coronation In spite of the breathless shortness of the time of preparation Bettina composed Coronation dances and practised curtseying to the Queen though she knew quite well that she would only see Her Majesty at a distance driving by in her golden coach The one consideration that sobered Bettina was who who on this short notice with all the feminine world crying passionately for frocks who could be found to make ours The more plain and simple the more important was style and cut Nobody in the country side was competent for such an undertaking Brighton Very dear and not first rate Suddenly Bettina clapped her hands [Pg ] The little French dressmaker Hermione told us about The very person Only wouldn t she be up to the eyes in work We remembered too she was said to be not strong She didn t care as a rule to work out of London But she had come to sew for those horrid people Lord Helmstone let the Pond House to the year before The people turned out to be badly off and after doing some damage they had gone away without paying their rent A law suit was pending between them and Lord Helmstone We had never known them but we could not help noticing their clothes They were beautiful Even my mother said so Hermione had played golf once or twice with the boy and girl One day she had admired openly something the girl was wearing Yes looks quite Bond Street doesn t it the girl said And all done at home by a little dressmaker at four and six a day Hermione had got the woman s address specially for us she said meaning for Bettina Hermione was always advising Bettina about her clothes and making the child discontented with what she had [Pg ] We had not wanted any little tame dressmaker at the time but we were enchanted now when Bettina turned up
