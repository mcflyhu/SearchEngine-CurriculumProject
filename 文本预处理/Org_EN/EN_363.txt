During the next two weeks Eve s moods fluctuated between compassionate altruism and bitter and half laughing scorn Life was so tremendous so pathetic so strenuous so absurd For the time being she was a watcher of other people s activities and she spent much of her time tramping here there and everywhere interested in everything because of her new prejudices She was glad to get out of the hotel since it was full of a certain type of American tourists tall sallow women who talked in loud harsh voices chiefly about food and the digestion of food where they had been and what they had paid for things The American man was a new type to Eve a mongrel still in the making The type puzzled and repelled her with its broad features and curious brown eyes generally seen behind rimless glasses Sometimes she sat and watched them and listened and fancied she caught a note of hysterical egoism Their laughter was not like an Englishman s laughter It burst out suddenly and rather fatuously betraying despite all the jaw setting and grim hunching of shoulders a lack of the deeper restraints They were always talking always squaring themselves up against the rest of the world with a neurotic self consciousness that realised that it was still only half civilised They suggested to Eve people who had set out to absorb culture in a single generation and had failed most grotesquely She kept an open mind as to the men but she disliked the women wholeheartedly They were studies in black and white and crude harsh studies with no softness of outline One Sunday she walked to Hyde Park and saw some of the suffragist speakers pelted with turf by a rowdily hostile crowd The occasion proved to be critical so far as some of her tendencies were concerned Militancy had not appealed to her There was too much of the drunk and disorderly about it too much spiteful screaming It suggested a reversion to savage back street methods and Eve s pride had refused to indulge in futile and wholly undignified exhibitions of violence There were better ways of protesting than by kicking policemen s shins breaking windows and sneaking about at midnight setting fire to houses Yet when she saw these women pelted hooted at and threatened the spirit of partisanship fired up at the challenge She was on the outskirts of the crowd and perhaps her pale and intent face attracted attention At all events she found a lout who looked like a young shop assistant standing close beside her and staring in her face Votes for women His ironical shout was an accusation and his eyes were the eyes of a bully And of a sudden Eve understood what it meant for a woman to have to stand up and face the coarse male element in the crowd all the young cads who were out for horseplay She was conscious of physical fear a shrinking from the bestial thoughtlessness of a mob that did things that any single man would have been ashamed to do The fellow was still staring at her Now then Votes for Women Own up He jogged her with his elbow and she kept a scornful profile towards him though trembling inwardly Someone interposed You there leave the young lady alone She s only listening like you and me The aggressor turned with a snarl but found himself up against a particularly big workman dressed in his Sunday clothes You re an old woman yourself Go home and sell stockings over the counter and leave decent people alone Eve thanked the man with a look and turned out of the crowd The workman followed her Scuse me miss I ll walk to the gates with you There are too many of these young blackguard fools about Thank you very much I ve got a lot of sympathy with the women but seems to me some of em are on the wrong road She looked at him interestedly He was big and fresh coloured and quiet and reminded her in his coarser way of James Canterton You think so It don t do to lose your temper even in a game and that s what some of the women are doing We re reasonable sort of creatures and it s no use going back to the old boot and claw business What they say is that they have tried reasoning and that men would not listen He laughed That s rot Excuse me miss You ve got to give reason a chance and a pretty long chance Do you think we working men won what we ve got in three months You have to go on shoving and shoving and in the end if you ve got common sense on your side you push the public through You can t expect things turned all topsy turvy in ten minutes because a few women get up on carts and scream They ought to know better They say it is the only thing that s left His blue eyes twinkled Not a bit of it miss The men were coming round We re better chaps better husbands and fathers than we were a hundred years ago You know miss a man ain t averse to a decent amount of pleasant persuasion It don t do to nag him or he may tell you to go to blazes Well I wish you good afternoon They had reached the gates and he touched the brim of his hard hat smiling down at her with shrewd kindness I m very grateful to you He coloured up and his smile broadened and Eve walked away down Oxford Street doing some pregnant thinking The man had reminded her of Canterton What was Canterton s attitude towards this movement and what was her attitude to Canterton now that she had touched more of the realities of life When she came to analyse her feelings she found that Canterton did not appear to exist for her in the present Fernhill and its atmosphere had become prehistoric It had removed into the Golden Age above and beyond criticism and she did not include it in this world of struggling prejudices and aspirations And yet when she let herself think of Canterton and Lynette she felt less sure of the sex antagonism that she was encouraging with scourge and prayer Canterton seemed to stand in the pathway of her advance looking down at her with eyes that smiled eyes that were without mockery Moreover something that he had once said to her kept opposing itself to her arbitrary and enthusiastic pessimism She could remember him stating his views and she could remember disagreeing with him He had said People are very much happier than you imagine Sentimentalists have always made too much of the woe of the world There is a sort of thing I call organic happiness the active physical happiness of the animal that is reasonably healthy Of course we grumble but don t make the mistake of taking grumbling for the cries of discontented misery I believe that most of the miserable people are over sensed under bodied neurotics They lack animal vitality I think I can speak from experience since I have mixed a good deal with working people In the mass they are happy much happier perhaps than we are Perhaps because they don t eat too much and so think dyspeptically That saying of Canterton s People are much happier than you imagine haunted Eve s consciousness walked at her side and would not suffer itself to be forgotten She had moments when she suspected that he had spoken a great truth He had told her once to read Walt Whitman but of what use was that great barbaric joyous person to her in her wilful viewing of sociological problems It was a statement that she could test by her own observations this assertion that the majority of people are happy The clerks and shopmen who lunched in the tea shops talked hard laughed and made a cheerful noise If she went to the docks or Covent Garden Market or watched labourers at work in the streets she seemed to strike a stolid yet jocose cheerfulness that massed itself against her rather pessimistic view of life The evening crowds in the streets were cheerful and these she supposed were the people who slaved in shops The factory girls out for the dinner hour were merry souls If she went into one of the parks on Sunday she could not exactly convince herself that she was watching a miserable people released for one day from the sordid and hopeless slavery of toil The mass of people did appear to be happy And Eve was absurdly angry with some of the prophet s anger who would rather have seen a city perish than that God should make him appear a fool Her convictions rallied themselves to meet the challenge of this apparent fact She contended that this happiness was a specious surface happiness One had but to get below the surface to penetrate behind the mere scenic effects of civilisation to discover the real sorrows What of the slums She had seen them with her own eyes What of the hospitals the asylums the prisons the workhouses the sweating dens even the sordid little suburbs She was in a temper to pile Pelion on Ossa in her desire to storm and overturn this serene Olympian assumption that mankind in the mass was happy In walking along Southampton Row into Kingsway she passed on most days a cheerful ruddy faced young woman who sold copies of Votes for Women This young woman was prettily plain but good to look at in a clean and comely and sturdy way Eve glanced at her each day with the eyes of a friend The figure became personal familiar prophetic She had marked down this young woman who sold papers as a Providence to whom she might ultimately appeal It seemed to her a curious necessity that she should be driven to try and prove that people were unhappy and that most men acted basely in their sexual relationships towards women This last conviction did not need much proving Being in a mood that demanded fanatical thoroughness Eve played with the ultimate baseness of man and made herself a candle to the night flying moths She repeated the experience twice once in Regent Street and once in Leicester Square Nothing but fanaticism could have made such an experiment possible and have enabled her to outface her scorn and her disgust Several men spoke to her and she dallied with each one for a few seconds before letting him feel her scorn She spent the last night of her stay in the Bloomsbury hotel sitting in the lounge and listening to three raucous American women who were talking over their travels They had been to Algiers Egypt Italy the South of France and of course to Paris The dominant talker who had gorgeous yellow hair not according to Nature and whose hands were always moving restlessly and showing off their rings seemed to remember and to identify the various places she had visited by some particular sort of food that she had eaten Siena Siena Wasn t that the place Mina where we had ravioli Did you go to R s at Monte Carlo It s an experience to have eaten at R s I shan t forget the Nile The Arab boy made some bad coffee and I was sick in the stomach They went on to describe their various hagglings with hotel keepers cabmen and shop people and the yellow haired lady who wore nippers on a very thin bridged sharp pointed nose had an exhilarating tale to tell of how she had stood out against a Paris taxi driver over a matter of ten cents Eve had always heard such lavish tales of American extravagance that she was surprised to discover in these women the worst sort of meanness the meanness that contrives to be generous on a few ostentatious occasions by beating all the lesser people s profits down to vanishing point She wondered whether these American women with their hard eyes selfish mouths and short fingered ill formed grasping hands were typical of this new hybrid race It amused her to contrast her own situation with theirs When to morrow s bill was paid and her box taken to Charing Cross station she calculated that she would have about twelve pence left in her purse And she was going to test another aspect of life on those twelve pennies It would not be ravioli or luncheon at R s Eve packed up her box next morning paid her bill and drove off to Charing Cross where she left her box in the cloak room She had exactly elevenpence left in her purse and it was her most serious intention to make these eleven pennies last her for the best part of two days One thing that she had lost without noticing it was her sense of humour Fanaticism cannot laugh Had Simeon Stylites glimpsed but for a moment the comic side of his existence he would have come down off that pillar like a cat off a burning roof The day turned out to be a very tiring one for her and Eve found out how abominably uncomfortable London can be when one has no room of one s own to go to and no particular business to do She just drifted about till she was tired and then the problem was to find something upon which to sit She spent the latter part of the morning in the gardens below Charing Cross Station and then it began to rain Lunch cost her threepence half a scone and butter and a glass of milk She dawdled over it but rain was still falling when she came out again into the street A station waiting room appeared to be her only refuge for it was a sixpenny day at the National Gallery and as she sat for two hours on a bench wondering whether the weather was going to make the experiment she contemplated a highly realistic and unpleasant test of what a wet night was like when spent on one of the Embankment seats The weather cleared about four o clock and Eve went across to a tea shop and spent another threepence on a cup of tea and a slice of cake She had made a point of making the most of her last breakfast at the hotel but she began to feel abominably hungry with a hunger that revolted against cake After tea she walked to Hyde Park sat there till within half an hour of dusk and then wandered back down Oxford Street growing hungrier and hungrier It was a very provoking sign of health but if one part of her clamoured for food her body as a whole protested that it was tired The sight of a restaurant made her loiter and she paused once or twice in front of some confectionery shop and looked at the cakes in the window But sweet stuffs did not tempt her They are the mere playthings of people who are well fed She found that she had a most primitive desire for good roast meat beef for preference swimming in brown gravy and she accepted her appetite quite solemnly as a phenomenon that threw an illuminating light upon the problems of existence Exploring a shabbier neighbourhood she discovered a cheap cook shop with a steaming window and a good advertising smell There was a bill of fare stuck up in the window and she calculated that she could spend another three pennies Sausages and mashed potatoes were to be had for that sum and in five minutes she was sitting at a wooden table covered with a dirty cloth and helping herself to mustard out of a cracked glass pot It was quite a carnal experience and she came out refreshed and much more cheerful telling herself with naive seriousness that she was splitting life up into its elements Food appeared to be a very important problem and hunger a lust whose strength is unknown save to the very few yet she was so near to her real self that she was on the edge of laughter Then it occurred to her that she was not doing the thing thoroughly that she had lapsed that she ought to have started the night hungry There was more time to be wasted and she strolled down Shaftesbury Avenue and round Piccadilly Circus into Regent Street The pavements were fairly crowded and the multitude of lights made her feel less lonely She loitered along looking into shop windows and she had amused herself in this way for about ten minutes before she became aware of another face that kept appearing near to hers She saw it reflected in four successive windows the face of an old man spruce yet senile the little moustache carefully trimmed a faint red patch on either cheek The eyes were turned to one side and seemed to be watching something She did not realise at first that that something was herself How are you to night dear Eve stared straight through the window for some seconds and then turned and faced him He was like Death valeted to perfection and turned out with all his senility polished to the last finger nail His lower eyelids were baggy and innumerable little veins showed in the skin that looked tightly stretched over his nose and cheekbones He smiled at her the fingers of one hand picking at the lapel of his coat I am glad to see you looking so nice dear Supposing we have a little dinner I beg your pardon I think you must be rather short sighted She thought as she walked away Supposing I had been a different sort of woman and supposing I had been hungry She made direct for the river after this experience and turning down Charing Cross and under the railway bridge saw the long sweep of the darkness between the fringes of yellow lights There were very few people about and a raw draught seemed to come up the river She crossed to the Embankment and walked along glancing over the parapet at the vaguely agitated and glimmering surface below The huge shadow of the bridge seemed to take the river at one leap The lapping of the water was cold and suggestively restless Then she turned her attention to the seats They seemed to be full packed from rail to rail with indistinct figures that were huddled close together All these figures were mute and motionless Once she saw a flutter of white where someone was picking broken food out of a piece of newspaper And once she heard a figure speaking in a monotonous grumbling voice that kept the same level Was she too late even for such a refuge She walked on and at last discovered a seat where a gap showed between a man s felt hat and a woman s bonnet Eve paused rather dubiously shrinking from thrusting herself into that vacant space She shrank from touching these sodden greasy things that had drifted like refuse into some sluggish backwater Then a quiver of pity and of shame overcame her She went and thrust herself into the vacant place The whole seat seemed to wriggle and squirm The man next to her heaved and woke up with a gulp Eve discovered at once that his breath was not ambrosial She felt a hand tugging at something It belonged to the old woman next to her Ere you re sitting on it I beg your pardon She felt something flat withdrawn It was a bloater wrapped up in a bit of paper but the woman did not explain She tucked the thing away behind her and relapsed The whole seat resettled itself No one said anything Eve heard nothing but the sound of breathing and the noise made by the passing of an occasional motor cab or train compassionate adj She is a compassionate person The compassionate judge gave the young offender a light sentence altruism n An important feature of moral behaviour is altruism Altruism is crucial for social cohesion
