Miss Bront left Roe Head in having won the affectionate regard both of her teacher and her school fellows and having formed there the two fast friendships which lasted her whole life long the one with Mary who has not kept her letters the other with E who has kindly entrusted me with a large portion of Miss Bront s correspondence with her This she has been induced to do by her knowledge of the urgent desire on the part of Mr Bront that the life of his daughter should be written and in compliance with a request from her husband that I should be permitted to have the use of these letters without which such a task could be but very imperfectly executed In order to shield this friend however from any blame or misconstruction it is only right to state that before granting me this privilege she throughout most carefully and completely effaced the names of the persons and places which occurred in them and also that such information as I have obtained from her bears reference solely to Miss Bront and her sisters and not to any other individuals whom I may find it necessary to allude to in connection with them In looking over the earlier portion of this correspondence I am struck afresh by the absence of hope which formed such a strong characteristic in Charlotte At an age when girls in general look forward to an eternal duration of such feelings as they or their friends entertain and can therefore see no hindrance to the fulfilment of any engagements dependent on the future state of the affections she is surprised that E keeps her promise to write In after life I was painfully impressed with the fact that Miss Bront never dared to allow herself to look forward with hope that she had no confidence in the future and I thought when I heard of the sorrowful years she had passed through that it had been this this pressure of grief which had crushed all buoyancy of expectation out of her But it appears from the letters that it must have been so to speak constitutional or perhaps the deep pang of losing her two elder sisters combined with a permanent state of bodily weakness in producing her hopelessness If her trust in God had been less strong she would have given way to unbounded anxiety at many a period of her life As it was we shall see she made a great and successful effort to leave her times in His hands After her return home she employed herself in teaching her sisters over whom she had had superior advantages She writes thus July st of her course of life at the parsonage An account of one day is an account of all In the morning from nine o clock till half past twelve I instruct my sisters and draw then we walk till dinner time After dinner I sew till tea time and after tea I either write read or do a little fancy work or draw as I please Thus in one delightful though somewhat monotonous course my life is passed I have been only out twice to tea since I came home We are expecting company this afternoon and on Tuesday next we shall have all the female teachers of the Sunday school to tea I may here introduce a quotation from a letter which I have received from Mary since the publication of the previous editions of this memoir Soon after leaving school she admitted reading something of Cobbett s She did not like him she said but all was fish that came to her net At this time she wrote to me that reading and drawing were the only amusements she had and that her supply of books was very small in proportion to her wants She never spoke of her aunt When I saw Miss Branwell she was a very precise person and looked very odd because her dress c was so utterly out of fashion She corrected one of us once for using the word spit or spitting She made a great favourite of Branwell She made her nieces sew with purpose or without and as far as possible discouraged any other culture She used to keep the girls sewing charity clothing and maintained to me that it was not for the good of the recipients but of the sewers It was proper for them to do it she said Charlotte never was in wild excitement that I know of When in health she used to talk better and indeed when in low spirits never spoke at all She needed her best spirits to say what was in her heart for at other times she had not courage She never gave decided opinions at such times Charlotte said she could get on with any one who had a bump at the top of their heads meaning conscientiousness I found that I seldom differed from her except that she was far too tolerant of stupid people if they had a grain of kindness in them It was about this time that Mr Bront provided his children with a teacher in drawing who turned out to be a man of considerable talent but very little principle Although they never attained to anything like proficiency they took great interest in acquiring this art evidently from an instinctive desire to express their powerful imaginations in visible forms Charlotte told me that at this period of her life drawing and walking out with her sisters formed the two great pleasures and relaxations of her day The three girls used to walk upwards toward the purple black moors the sweeping surface of which was broken by here and there a stone quarry and if they had strength and time to go far enough they reached a waterfall where the beck fell over some rocks into the bottom They seldom went downwards through the village They were shy of meeting even familiar faces and were scrupulous about entering the house of the very poorest uninvited They were steady teachers at the Sunday School a habit which Charlotte kept up very faithfully even after she was left alone but they never faced their kind voluntary and always preferred the solitude and freedom of the moors In the September of this year Charlotte went to pay her first visit to her friend E It took her into the neighbourhood of Roe Head and brought her into pleasant contact with many of her old school fellows After this visit she and her friend seem to have agreed to correspond in French for the sake of improvement in the language But this improvement could not be great when it could only amount to a greater familiarity with dictionary words and when there was no one to explain to them that a verbal translation of English idioms hardly constituted French composition but the effort was laudable and of itself shows how willing they both were to carry on the education which they had begun under Miss W I will give an extract which whatever may be thought of the language is graphic enough and presents us with a happy little family picture the eldest sister returning home to the two younger after a fortnight s absence J arrivait Haworth en parfaite sauvet sans le moindre accident ou malheur Mes petites s urs couraient hors de la maison pour me rencontrer aussit t que la voiture se fit voir et elles m embrassaient avec autant d empressement et de plaisir comme si j avais t absente pour plus d an Mon Papa ma Tante et le monsieur dent men fr re avoit parl furent tous assembl s dans le Salon et en peu de temps je m y rendis aussi C est souvent l ordre du Ciel que quand on a perdu un plaisir il y en a un autre pr t prendre sa place Ainsi je venois de partir de tr s chers amis mais tout l heure je revins des parens aussi chers et bon dans le moment M me que vous me perdiez ose je croire que mon d part vous tait un chagrin vous attendites l arriv e de votre fr re et de votre s ur J ai donn mes s urs les pommes que vous leur envoyiez avec tant de bont elles disent qu elles sont s r que Mademoiselle E est tr s aimable et bonne l une et l autre sont extr mement impatientes de vous voir j esp re qu en peu de mois elles auront ce plaisir But it was some time yet before the friends could meet and meanwhile they agreed to correspond once a month There were no events to chronicle in the Haworth letters Quiet days occupied in reaching and feminine occupations in the house did not present much to write about and Charlotte was naturally driven to criticise books Of these there were many in different plights and according to their plight kept in different places The well bound were ranged in the sanctuary of Mr Bront s study but the purchase of books was a necessary luxury to him but as it was often a choice between binding an old one or buying a new one the familiar volume which had been hungrily read by all the members of the family was sometimes in such a condition that the bedroom shelf was considered its fitting place Up and down the house were to be found many standard works of a solid kind Sir Walter Scott s writings Wordsworth s and Southey s poems were among the lighter literature while as having a character of their own earnest wild and occasionally fanatical may be named some of the books which came from the Branwell side of the family from the Cornish followers of the saintly John Wesley and which are touched on in the account of the works to which Caroline Helstone had access in Shirley Some venerable Lady s Magazines that had once performed a voyage with their owner and undergone a storm possibly part of the relics of Mrs Bront s possessions contained in the ship wrecked on the coast of Cornwall and whose pages were stained with salt water some mad Methodist Magazines full of miracles and apparitions and preternatural warnings ominous dreams and frenzied fanaticisms and the equally mad letters of Mrs Elizabeth Rowe from the Dead to the Living Mr Bront encouraged a taste for reading in his girls and though Miss Branwell kept it in due bounds by the variety of household occupations in which she expected them not merely to take a part but to become proficients thereby occupying regularly a good portion of every day they were allowed to get books from the circulating library at Keighley and many a happy walk up those long four miles must they have had burdened with some new book into which they peeped as they hurried home Not that the books were what would generally be called new in the beginning of the two friends seem almost simultaneously to have fallen upon Kenilworth and Charlotte writes as follows about it I am glad you like Kenilworth it is certainly more resembling a romance than a novel in my opinion one of the most interesting works that ever emanated from the great Sir Walter s pen Varney is certainly the personification of consummate villainy and in the delineation of his dark and profoundly artful mind Scott exhibits a wonderful knowledge of human nature as well as a surprising skill in embodying his perceptions so as to enable others to become participators in that knowledge Commonplace as this extract may seem it is noteworthy on two or three accounts in the first place instead of discussing the plot or story she analyses the character of Varney and next she knowing nothing of the world both from her youth and her isolated position has yet been so accustomed to hear human nature distrusted as to receive the notion of intense and artful villainy without surprise What was formal and set in her way of writing to E diminished as their personal acquaintance increased and as each came to know the home of the other so that small details concerning people and places had their interest and their significance In the summer of she wrote to invite her friend to come and pay her a visit Aunt thought it would be better she says to defer it until about the middle of summer as the winter and even the spring seasons are remarkably cold and bleak among our mountains The first impression made on the visitor by the sisters of her school friend was that Emily was a tall long armed girl more fully grown than her elder sister extremely reserved in manner I distinguish reserve from shyness because I imagine shyness would please if it knew how whereas reserve is indifferent whether it pleases or not Anne like her eldest sister was shy Emily was reserved Branwell was rather a handsome boy with tawny hair to use Miss Bront s phrase for a more obnoxious colour All were very clever original and utterly different to any people or family E had ever seen before But on the whole it was a happy visit to all parties Charlotte says in writing to E just after her return home Were I to tell you of the impression you have made on every one here you would accuse me of flattery Papa and aunt are continually adducing you as an example for me to shape my actions and behaviour by Emily and Anne say they never saw any one they liked so well as you And Tabby whom you have absolutely fascinated talks a great deal more nonsense about your ladyship than I care to repeat It is now so dark that notwithstanding the singular property of seeing in the night time which the young ladies at Roe Head used to attribute to me I can scribble no longer To a visitor at the parsonage it was a great thing to have Tabby s good word She had a Yorkshire keenness of perception into character and it was not everybody she liked Haworth is built with an utter disregard of all sanitary conditions the great old churchyard lies above all the houses and it is terrible to think how the very water springs of the pumps below must be poisoned But this winter of was particularly wet and rainy and there were an unusual number of deaths in the village A dreary season it was to the family in the parsonage their usual walks obstructed by the spongy state of the moors the passing and funeral bells so frequently tolling and filling the heavy air with their mournful sound and when they were still the chip chip of the mason as he cut the grave stones in a shed close by In many living as it were in a churchyard and with all the sights and sounds connected with the last offices to the dead things of everyday occurrence the very familiarity would have bred indifference But it was otherwise with Charlotte Bront One of her friends says I have seen her turn pale and feel faint when in Hartshead church some one accidentally remarked that we were walking over graves Charlotte was certainly afraid of death Not only of dead bodies or dying people She dreaded it as something horrible She thought we did not know how long the moment of dissolution might really be or how terrible This was just such a terror as only hypochondriacs can provide for themselves She told me long ago that a misfortune was often preceded by the dream frequently repeated which she gives to Jane Eyre of carrying a little wailing child and being unable to still it She described herself as having the most painful sense of pity for the little thing lying inert as sick children do while she walked about in some gloomy place with it such as the aisle of Haworth Church The misfortunes she mentioned were not always to herself She thought such sensitiveness to omens was like the cholera present to susceptible people some feeling more some less About the beginning of E went to London for the first time The idea of her friend s visit seems to have stirred Charlotte strangely She appears to have formed her notions of its probable consequences from some of the papers in the British Essayists The Rambler The Mirror or The Lounger which may have been among the English classics on the parsonage bookshelves for she evidently imagines that an entire change of character for the worse is the usual effect of a visit to the great metropolis and is delighted to find that E is E still And as her faith in her friend s stability is restored her own imagination is deeply moved by the idea of what great wonders are to be seen in that vast and famous city Haworth February th Your letter gave me real and heartfelt pleasure mingled with no small share of astonishment Mary had previously informed me of your departure for London and I had not ventured to calculate on any communication from you while surrounded by the splendours and novelties of that great city which has been called the mercantile metropolis of Europe Judging from human nature I thought that a little country girl for the first time in a situation so well calculated to excite curiosity and to distract attention would lose all remembrance for a time at least of distant and familiar objects and give herself up entirely to the fascination of those scenes which were then presented to her view Your kind interesting and most welcome epistle showed me however that I had been both mistaken and uncharitable in these suppositions I was greatly amused at the tone of nonchalance which you assumed while treating of London and its wonders Did you not feel awed while gazing at St Paul s and Westminster Abbey Had you no feeling of intense and ardent interest when in St James s you saw the palace where so many of England s kings have held their courts and beheld the representations of their persons on the walls You should not be too much afraid of appearing country bred the magnificence of London has drawn exclamations of astonishment from travelled men experienced in the world its wonders and beauties Have you yet seen anything of the great personages whom the sitting of Parliament now detains in London the Duke of Wellington Sir Robert Peel Earl Grey Mr Stanley Mr O Connell If I were you I would not be too anxious to spend my time in reading whilst in town Make use of your own eyes for the purposes of observation now and for a time at least lay aside the spectacles with which authors would furnish us In a postscript she adds Will you be kind enough to inform me of the number of performers in the King s military band And in something of the same strain she writes on June th My own Dear E I may rightfully and truly call you so now You have returned or are returning from London from the great city which is to me as apocryphal as Babylon or Nineveh or ancient Rome You are withdrawing from the world as it is called and bringing with you if your letters enable me to form a correct judgment a heart as unsophisticated as natural as true as that you carried there I am slow very slow to believe the protestations of another I know my own sentiments I can read my own mind but the minds of the rest of man and woman kind are to me sealed volumes hieroglyphical scrolls which I cannot easily either unseal or decipher Yet time careful study long acquaintance overcome most difficulties and in your case I think they have succeeded well in bringing to light and construing that hidden language whose turnings windings inconsistencies and obscurities so frequently baffle the researches of the honest observer of human nature I am truly grateful for your mindfulness of so obscure a person as myself and I hope the pleasure is not altogether selfish I trust it is partly derived from the consciousness that my friend s character is of a higher a more steadfast order than I was once perfectly aware of Few girls would have done as you have done would have beheld the glare and glitter and dazzling display of London with dispositions so unchanged heart so uncontaminated I see no affectation in your letters no trifling no frivolous contempt of plain and weak admiration of showy persons and things In these days of cheap railway trips we may smile at the idea of a short visit to London having any great effect upon the character whatever it may have upon the intellect But her London her great apocryphal city was the town of a century before to which giddy daughters dragged unwilling papas or went with injudicious friends to the detriment of all their better qualities and sometimes to the ruin of their fortunes it was the Vanity Fair of the Pilgrim s Progress to her But see the just and admirable sense with which she can treat a subject of which she is able to overlook all the bearings Haworth July th In your last you request me to tell you of your faults Now really how can you be so foolish I won t tell you of your faults because I don t know them What a creature would that be who after receiving an affectionate and kind letter from a beloved friend should sit down and write a catalogue of defects by way of answer Imagine me doing so and then consider what epithets you would bestow on me Conceited dogmatical hypocritical little humbug I should think would be the mildest Why child I ve neither time nor inclination to reflect on your faults when you are so far from me and when besides kind letters and presents and so forth are continually bringing forth your goodness in the most prominent light Then too there are judicious relations always round you who can much better discharge that unpleasant office I have no doubt their advice is completely at your service why then should I intrude mine If you will not hear them it will be vain though one should rise from the dead to instruct you Let us have no more nonsense if you love me Mr is going to be married is he Well his wife elect appeared to me to be a clever and amiable lady as far as I could judge from the little I saw of her and from your account Now to that flattering sentence must I tack on a list of her faults You say it is in contemplation for you to leave I am sorry for it is a pleasant spot one of the old family halls of England surrounded by lawn and woodland speaking of past times and suggesting to me at least happy feelings M thought you grown less did she I am not grown a bit but as short and dumpy as ever You ask me to recommend you some books for your perusal I will do so in as few words as I can If you like poetry let it be first rate Milton Shakspeare Thomson Goldsmith Pope if you will though I don t admire him Scott Byron Campbell Wordsworth and Southey Now don t be startled at the names of Shakspeare and Byron Both these were great men and their works are like themselves You will know how to choose the good and to avoid the evil the finest passages are always the purest the bad are invariably revolting you will never wish to read them over twice Omit the comedies of Shakspeare and the Don Juan perhaps the Cain of Byron though the latter is a magnificent poem and read the rest fearlessly that must indeed be a depraved mind which can gather evil from Henry VIII from Richard III from Macbeth and Hamlet and Julius C sar Scott s sweet wild romantic poetry can do you no harm Nor can Wordsworth s nor Campbell s nor Southey s the greatest part at least of his some is certainly objectionable For history read Hume Rollin and the Universal History if you can I never did For fiction read Scott alone all novels after his are worthless For biography read Johnson s Lives of the Poets Boswell s Life of Johnson Southey s Life of Nelson Lockhart s Life of Burns Moore s Life of Sheridan Moore s Life of Byron Wolfe s Remains For natural history read Bewick and Audubon and Goldsmith and White s history of Selborne For divinity your brother will advise you there I can only say adhere to standard authors and avoid novelty From this list we see that she must have had a good range of books from which to choose her own reading It is evident that the womanly consciences of these two correspondents were anxiously alive to many questions discussed among the stricter religionists The morality of Shakspeare needed the confirmation of Charlotte s opinion to the sensitive E and a little later she inquired whether dancing was objectionable when indulged in for an hour or two in parties of boys and girls Charlotte replies I should hesitate to express a difference of opinion from Mr or from your excellent sister but really the matter seems to me to stand thus It is allowed on all hands that the sin of dancing consists not in the mere action of shaking the shanks as the Scotch say but in the consequences that usually attend it namely frivolity and waste of time when it is used only as in the case you state for the exercise and amusement of an hour among young people who surely may without any breach of God s commandments be allowed a little light heartedness these consequences cannot follow Ergo according to my manner of arguing the amusement is at such times perfectly innocent Although the distance between Haworth and B was but seventeen miles it was difficult to go straight from the one to the other without hiring a gig or vehicle of some kind for the journey Hence a visit from Charlotte required a good deal of pre arrangement The Haworth gig was not always to be had and Mr Bront was often unwilling to fall into any arrangement for meeting at Bradford or other places which would occasion trouble to others The whole family had an ample share of that sensitive pride which led them to dread incurring obligations and to fear outstaying their welcome when on any visit I am not sure whether Mr Bront did not consider distrust of others as a part of that knowledge of human nature on which he piqued himself His precepts to this effect combined with Charlotte s lack of hope made her always fearful of loving too much of wearying the objects of her affection and thus she was often trying to restrain her warm feelings and was ever chary of that presence so invariably welcome to her true friends According to this mode of acting when she was invited for a month she stayed but a fortnight amidst E s family to whom every visit only endeared her the more and by whom she was received with that kind of quiet gladness with which they would have greeted a sister She still kept up her childish interest in politics In March she writes What do you think of the course politics are taking I make this enquiry because I now think you take a wholesome interest in the matter formerly you did not care greatly about it B you see is triumphant Wretch I am a hearty hater and if there is any one I thoroughly abhor it is that man But the Opposition is divided Red hots and Luke warms and the Duke par excellence the Duke and Sir Robert Peel show no signs of insecurity though they have been twice beat so Courage mon amie as the old chevaliers used to say before they joined battle In the middle of the summer of a great family plan was mooted at the parsonage The question was to what trade or profession should Branwell be brought up He was now nearly eighteen it was time to decide He was very clever no doubt perhaps to begin with the greatest genius in this rare family The sisters hardly recognised their own or each others powers but they knew his The father ignorant of many failings in moral conduct did proud homage to the great gifts of his son for Branwell s talents were readily and willingly brought out for the entertainment of others Popular admiration was sweet to him And this led to his presence being sought at arvills and all the great village gatherings for the Yorkshiremen have a keen relish for intellect and it likewise procured him the undesirable distinction of having his company recommended by the landlord of the Black Bull to any chance traveller who might happen to feel solitary or dull over his liquor Do you want some one to help you with your bottle sir If you do I ll send up for Patrick so the villagers called him till the day of his death though in his own family he was always Branwell And while the messenger went the landlord entertained his guest with accounts of the wonderful talents of the boy whose precocious cleverness and great conversational powers were the pride of the village The attacks of ill health to which Mr Bront had been subject of late years rendered it not only necessary that he should take his dinner alone for the sake of avoiding temptations to unwholesome diet but made it also desirable that he should pass the time directly succeeding his meals in perfect quiet And this necessity combined with due attention to his parochial duties made him partially ignorant how his son employed himself out of lesson time His own youth had been spent among people of the same conventional rank as those into whose companionship Branwell was now thrown but he had had a strong will and an earnest and persevering ambition and a resoluteness of purpose which his weaker son wanted It is singular how strong a yearning the whole family had towards the art of drawing Mr Bront had been very solicitous to get them good instruction the girls themselves loved everything connected with it all descriptions or engravings of great pictures and in default of good ones they would take and analyse any print or drawing which came in their way and find out how much thought had gone to its composition what ideas it was intended to suggest and what it did suggest In the same spirit they laboured to design imaginations of their own they lacked the power of execution not of conception At one time Charlotte had the notion of making her living as an artist and wearied her eyes in drawing with pre Raphaelite minuteness but not with pre Raphaelite accuracy for she drew from fancy rather than from nature But they all thought there could be no doubt about Branwell s talent for drawing I have seen an oil painting of his done I know not when but probably about this time It was a group of his sisters life size three quarters length not much better than sign painting as to manipulation but the likenesses were I should think admirable I could only judge of the fidelity with which the other two were depicted from the striking resemblance which Charlotte upholding the great frame of canvas and consequently standing right behind it bore to her own representation though it must have been ten years and more since the portraits were taken The picture was divided almost in the middle by a great pillar On the side of the column which was lighted by the sun stood Charlotte in the womanly dress of that day of gigot sleeves and large collars On the deeply shadowed side was Emily with Anne s gentle face resting on her shoulder Emily s countenance struck me as full of power Charlotte s of solicitude Anne s of tenderness The two younger seemed hardly to have attained their full growth though Emily was taller than Charlotte they had cropped hair and a more girlish dress I remember looking on those two sad earnest shadowed faces and wondering whether I could trace the mysterious expression which is said to foretell an early death I had some fond superstitious hope that the column divided their fates from hers who stood apart in the canvas as in life she survived I liked to see that the bright side of the pillar was towards her that the light in the picture fell on her I might more truly have sought in her presentment nay in her living face for the sign of death in her prime They were good likenesses however badly executed From thence I should guess his family augured truly that if Branwell had but the opportunity and alas had but the moral qualities he might turn out a great painter The best way of preparing him to become so appeared to be to send him as a pupil to the Royal Academy I dare say he longed and yearned to follow this path principally because it would lead him to that mysterious London that Babylon the great which seems to have filled the imaginations and haunted the minds of all the younger members of this recluse family To Branwell it was more than a vivid imagination it was an impressed reality By dint of studying maps he was as well acquainted with it even down to its by ways as if he had lived there Poor misguided fellow this craving to see and know London and that stronger craving after fame were never to be satisfied He was to die at the end of a short and blighted life But in this year of all his home kindred were thinking how they could best forward his views and how help him up to the pinnacle where he desired to be What their plans were let Charlotte explain These are not the first sisters who have laid their lives as a sacrifice before their brother s idolized wish Would to God they might be the last who met with such a miserable return Haworth July th I had hoped to have had the extreme pleasure of seeing you at Haworth this summer but human affairs are mutable and human resolutions must bend to the course of events We are all about to divide break up separate Emily is going to school Branwell is going to London and I am going to be a governess This last determination I formed myself knowing that I should have to take the step sometime and better sune as syne to use the Scotch proverb and knowing well that papa would have enough to do with his limited income should Branwell be placed at the Royal Academy and Emily at Roe Head Where am I going to reside you will ask Within four miles of you at a place neither of us is unacquainted with being no other than the identical Roe Head mentioned above Yes I am going to teach in the very school where I was myself taught Miss W made me the offer and I preferred it to one or two proposals of private governess ship which I had before received I am sad very sad at the thoughts of leaving home but duty necessity these are stern mistresses who will not be disobeyed Did I not once say you ought to be thankful for your independence I felt what I said at the time and I repeat it now with double earnestness if anything would cheer me it is the idea of being so near you Surely you and Polly will come and see me it would be wrong in me to doubt it you were never unkind yet Emily and I leave home on the th of
