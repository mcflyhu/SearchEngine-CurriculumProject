When Rosa Varona regained consciousness sufficiently to understand what had happened she proved herself a person of no little self control She went to pieces for a moment as was only natural but O Reilly soon succeeded in calming her Nor did he have to remind her twice that this was no time for weakness or hysteria it was she in fact who first voiced the fear that Cobo dead was scarcely less of a menace than Cobo alive What are we going to do with him she inquired Jacket too appreciated the dangers of the situation We must get rid of him quickly said he for his men are close by he will be missed and there will be a search I don t intend to make him a present of that treasure O Reilly said grimly It is our only salvation But how are we going to hide him Jacket inquired One might as well try to conceal a church oxen couldn t hoist him out of that hole Precisely He has made our work easy for us We can t take more than a small part of the money with us anyhow the rest will have to lie here until the war is over Well We shall leave Cobo on guard over what remains Jacket was immensely pleased with this idea once he had grasped it What could be better he cried The man s spirit is evil enough to frighten people away and we will drop stones upon him so that he can learn the taste of his own medicine It suits me exactly to think of Colonel Cobo standing on his head in a hole in the ground for the rest of eternity O Reilly was by this time suffering the full reaction from the events of the past half hour and he was nearer exhaustion than he dreamed but conquering his repugnance for his unescapable task he lowered himself once more into the well His arms were weak however and his fingers numb so he fell rather than slid the length of the rope He managed to open the door of the treasure chamber then entered and loaded his pockets with gold He sent up the jewel box at the end of the rope dragged the body of Cobo into the cave then wedged the barricade back into place It required the combined strength of Rosa and Jacket to help him the last few feet of his climb Now fetch stones rubbish anything and throw it in there he gasped The boy and the girl fell to with a will and after a time Johnnie joined them Slowly laboriously the three of them carried debris from the edge of the quarry and bricks from the ruined house they scraped up armfuls of leaves and trash anything in fact which would serve to raise the bottom of the shaft and conceal the entrance to their enemy s resting place It was slavish work but O Reilly kept them at it until they were ready to drop Daylight overtook them at their task They were weak sick deadly tired they could barely shuffle a few yards at a time when they finally reached Asensio s hut nevertheless there was hope in their hearts for O Reilly s ragged clothes sagged with the weight of gold pieces and the little metal box he carried was heavy Nor were they greatly concerned about the safety of the treasure they had left behind for the entrance to the cavern lay deeply buried and Cobo the guerrilla stood guard over the chests of plate and the casks of coin Evangelina vastly bewildered at the sight of the coin which was forced into her palm went for food and spent most of the day in cooking it The treasure hunters alternately slept and ate It was not until well along toward evening that Rosa and O Reilly felt any desire to take stock of the contents of that jewel box but finally with heads together and with backs to the door of the bohio they made a furtive examination It was a task that held them spellbound for there were loose gems of many varieties some well some badly cut there were pieces of antique Spanish jewelry valuable mainly by virtue of their antiquity clumsy settings of silver and gold containing dead uninteresting stones others of the finest and most delicate workmanship Some of the pieces were like glittering cobwebs enmeshing sparks of fire and drops of blood They found emeralds and sapphires the value of which they did not attempt to estimate and besides these a miscellaneous assortment of semiprecious stones There was a fine collection of opals of every size and color among which were a number of huge flat black ones indescribably gorgeous with their ever changing peacock hues But finest of all the lot were the pearls Where old Don Esteban had secured these latter was a mystery for he had not been a widely traveled man They were splendid unrivaled in size and luster Some had the iridescence of soap bubbles others ranged from pink to deepest chocolate in color To touch them was like sacrilege O Reilly realized vaguely that he held in his lap a fortune greater than his wildest dreams had ever compassed These were the jewels of a rajah It seemed incredible that this ragged girl beside him was a regal heiress the possessor of a treasure such as kings might envy After a time he realized that the mere possession of these gems constituted a new and overwhelming menace All that evening he and Rosa cowered in the darkness whispering furtively their nerves on edge their senses strained It seemed to them that new and unsuspected perils stalked abroad through the night Morning found all hands more nearly rational and feeling the first gnawings of a healthy hunger Even Asensio confessed to a quite miraculous improvement While Evangelina prepared breakfast the lovers agreed upon a story to explain the origin of that mysterious gold piece and later Johnnie warned Jacket for a second time to keep his tongue between his teeth We will have to be doubly careful now he told the boy An unguarded word or an incautious move would be the end of us Jacket nodded his complete comprehension Sure All Spaniards are robbers and they d kill us for a peso Yes and the pacificos are no better I tell you we need to get out of this place I intend to arrange it at once but the sight of those jewels has frightened me If we are searched if we are even suspected Oh Rosa wouldn t have any more use for her pretty trinkets She d be in heaven before you could scratch your nose O Reilly frowned She isn t at all strong yet I m wondering if she can endure the hardships we ll encounter when or if we get away Exactly what I was thinking I ve been considering another plan Indeed O Reilly scanned the face of his young friend with interest He was beginning to have a high regard for Jacket s capabilities and the boy s exploit of the night before certainly entitled him to be heard upon any subject I told you about my friend at the market the latter continued Well he is a miserable Spaniard but he has a son in the manigua One of us Johnnie was surprised Yes The old fellow owns a volandra in which he brings charcoal from the eastward twice a month There was a moment of silence then O Reilly said slowly as if hesitating even to voice such a suggestion You mean he might take us out of here on his schooner Who knows He s not a bad old fellow and he likes me But there would be no place for women How well does he like you Oh we are like two thieves After another period of thought O Reilly said Take me to him and remember I m your brother Juan The Matanzas market did not present a scene of great activity when the two friends slunk into it It was midday and what food had earlier been offered for sale had for the most part long since disappeared All but a few of the stalls were empty and a number of emaciated reconcentrados were searching listlessly among them for neglected scraps or imploring aid from such marketmen as still lingered about Like most Spanish markets the building was far from clean and housed odors unpleasant even to starving people In the smelliest section at one of the fish stalls Jacket accosted a villainous old brigand in a rough Gallego cap baggy blouse and trousers and straw sandals Good day my Captain he cried cheerily The Spaniard raised his head scowled ferociously then waved a long thin bladed knife in menacing fashion Aha So there you are robber Be off now before I slit your greedy little belly He spoke in an angry husky voice When Jacket stood his ground he reached for him with a hand upon which blood and fish scales had dried Didn t I promise to give you to the soldiers if you came back to bother me Jacket was unabashed by this hostile reception He grinned broadly and with an impudent eye he scanned the empty premises Where is my little fish he demanded As I live I believe you have sold it God What a miser For the sake of another centavo you would see me starve There s a heart for you YOUR little fish roared the brigand clashing his blade on the filthy counter No shark ever stole so many fish as you Come I shall make an end of you and have some peace Starve YOU Bah Your body is like a gourd Yes and quite as hollow I starve because you possess a heart of stone One little fish no longer than your finger Just one Not so much as a fin cried the man Can I feed all the rebels in Matanzas One little fish Jacket wheedled for the sake of Miguelito who is bravely fighting in the manigua to the shame of his miserly old father fattening on the groans of good patriots like me Must I remind you again that Miguelito was my brother That I have robbed my own belly in order to give him food Liar It is true You never saw him Miguel Morin With a scar on his neck The bravest boy in all the Orient Ask him about Narciso Villar Come give me my fish Or must I lie down and die before your very eyes to prove my hunger What a nuisance grumbled the marketman He reached into a basket and flung a mackerel upon the table There I saved it for you and sent the good women of Matanzas away empty handed But it is the very last Annoy me again and I shall open you with my knife and put salt on you Ah You ARE my good captain Jacket cried in triumph possessing himself of the prize Where would I have been but for you Turning to O Reilly who had looked on from a distance at this artificial quarrel he said Captain Morin this is that brother Juan of whom I have told you Morin smiled at Johnnie and extended his dirty palm The little fellow can speak the truth when he wishes it seems I began to doubt that he had a brother What a boy eh Leaning closer he whispered hoarsely It is cheaper to give him a fish than to have him steal a whole basketful But he is a great liar Even yet I m not sure that he knows my Miguelito You have a son with the Insurrectos Yes The fisherman cast a furtive glance over his shoulder He is a traitor of the worst sort and I don t approve of him but he s a brave boy and he loves fighting Sometimes I get hungry to see him Why don t you go and fight by his side Jacket demanded God forbid Morin flung up his hands I m a loyal subject Well we are going back to fight We are going to escape and join Gomez once more Jacket made the announcement calmly S SH What talk Morin was in a nervous panic lest they be overheard As if anybody could escape from Matanzas What made you come here if you are so eager to fight I ll tell you O Reilly assumed direction of the conversation There are three of us brothers we two and Esteban a pretty little fellow He was captured by Cobo s men and driven in and we came to find him You came HERE here to Matanzas Old Morin was incredulous He muttered an oath That was a very nice thing to do And did you find him Oh yes That was easy enough for the lad is deformed Tse Tse What a pity But he is sick dying Of course They re all dying the poor people It is terrible We O Reilly faltered slightly so much hung upon the manner in which Morin would take what he was about to say We want to get him out of here we MUST do so or we ll lose him Sensing some hidden significance some obscure purpose behind this confession the Spaniard looked sharply at the speaker His leathery countenance darkened Why are you telling me this he inquired What makes you think I won t betray you Something tells me you won t You have a good heart and you have kept Narciso from starving for the sake of your own boy Well Will you help us I In Heaven s name how By taking us away in your charcoal schooner You re mad Morin cast another apprehensive look over his shoulder I m a poor man All I have is my two boats the vivero which brings fish and the volandra which sails with charcoal Do you think I d forfeit them and my life for strangers There wouldn t be much risk Indeed Perhaps I know something about that O Reilly leaned closer You say you re a poor man I will pay you well Morin eyed the ragged speaker scornfully it was plain that he put no faith in such a promise and so O Reilly took a piece of gold from his pocket at sight of which the fisherman started What kind of pacificos are you Morin queried His mouth had fallen open his eyes protruded I too am a poor man but I m willing to buy freedom for my little brothers and myself How many coins like that have you Um m more than one enough to pay you for several cargoes of coal And I have given you fish to eat Morin rolled his eyes at Jacket He pondered the marvel of what he had seen he muttered something to himself For the sake of Miguelito Jacket urged CARAMBA What a hard hearted father begot that boy Hush The fisherman was scowling To O Reilly he said You do wrong to tempt a poor man My brother Esteban is sick He is a frail little lad with a crooked back God will reward you Perhaps But how much will YOU pay Ten Spanish sovereigns like this all that I have No It is not enough O Reilly took Jacket s hand and turned away I m sorry said he I wish I might offer you more He had taken several steps before Morin hailed him Come back to morrow the fisherman cried crossly We will try to talk like sensible people The brothers Villar were back at Morin s fish stand on the following afternoon and they returned daily thereafter until they at last prevailed over the Spaniard s fears and won his promise of assistance That much accomplished they made several cautious purchases a coat here a shirt there a pair of trousers in another place until they had assembled a complete boy s outfit of clothing At first Rosa refused absolutely to desert her two faithful negro friends and O Reilly won her consent to consider his plan of escape only after he had put the matter squarely up to Asensio and his wife and after both had refused to enter into it Asensio declared that he was too sick to be moved and asserted that he would infinitely prefer to remain where he was provided he was supplied with sufficient money to cover his needs Evangelina agreed with him Then and not until then did Rosa begin her preparations First she made Evangelina cut her hair a sacrilege that wrung sighs and tears and loud lamentations from the black woman after which she altered the suit of boy s clothing to fit her figure or rather to conceal it When at last she put it on for O Reilly s approval she was very shy very self conscious and so altogether unboylike that he shook his head positively My dear you ll never do he told her You are altogether too pretty But wait until I put that hideous hump upon my back and stain my face then you will see how ugly I can look Perhaps he said doubtfully A moment then his frown lightened You give me a thought said he You shall wear the jewels Wear them How On your back in that very hump It will be the safest possible way to conceal them Rosa clapped her hands in delight Why of course It is the very thing Wait until I show you Profiting by her first moment alone Evangelina and her husband being still in ignorance of the contents of the treasure box Rosa made a bundle out of the jewels and trinkets and fastened it securely inside her coat After a few experiments she adjusted it to her liking then called O Reilly once more This time he was better satisfied he was in truth surprised at the effect of the disfigurement and after putting Rosa through several rehearsals in masculine deportment he pronounced the disguise as nearly perfect as could be hoped for An application of Evangelina s stain to darken her face a few tatters and a liberal application of dirt to the suit and he declared that Rosa would pass anywhere as a boy There came a night when the three of them bade good by to their black companions and slipped away across the city to that section known as Pueblo Nuevo then followed the road along the water front until they found shelter within the shadows of a rickety structure which had once served as a bath house The building stood partially upon piles and under it they crept knee deep in the lapping waves To their left was the illumination of Matanzas to their right the lights of the Penas Alias fort ahead of them empty and dark save for the riding lights of a few small coasting vessels lay the harbor The refugees waited a long time they were beginning to fear that old Morin s nerve had weakened at the eleventh hour when they beheld a skiff approaching the shore It glided closer entered the shade of the bathhouse then a voice cried Pset You are there It was Morin himself Hastily the three piled aboard Morin bent to his oars and the skiff shot out You were not observed he inquired No Morin rowed in silence for a time then confessed This business is not to my liking There is too much risk Think of me putting my neck in peril Ho Jacket chuckled It is just the sort of thing that I enjoy If Miguelito was captain of his father s boat we d been in Cardenas by daybreak When do you sail O Reilly asked At dawn God permitting You will have to remain hidden and you mustn t even breathe I have told my men that you are members of my wife s family good Spaniards but I doubt if they will believe it Then you are to be my uncle Jacket inquired from his seat in the bow Caramba That s more than I can stand To be considered a Spaniard is bad enough but to be known as the nephew of an old miser who smells of fish It is too much Badinage of this sort did not displease the fisherman It is not often they board us nowadays he said more hopefully but of course one never can tell Perhaps we will sail out under their very noses He brought the skiff alongside a battered old schooner and his passengers clambered aboard There was a tiny cabin aft and on it sheltered from the night dew by a loose fold of the mainsail were two sleeping men The new comers followed Morin down into the evil little cabin where he warned them in a stertorous whisper Not a sound mind you If any one comes aboard you must shift for yourselves Creep into the hold and hide Of course if we are searched He muttered something then groped his way out on deck and closed the hatch behind him It was inky dark in the cabin the occupants dared not move about for fear of waking the sailors overhead Time passed slowly After a while Jacket yawned and sighed and grumbled under his breath Finally he stretched himself out upon a narrow board bench and fell asleep O Reilly drew Rosa to him and she snuggled comfortably into his embrace resting her head upon his shoulder It was their first real moment alone Now that they had actually embarked upon this enterprise and the girl had given herself entirely into his hands now that an imminent peril encompassed them both Johnnie felt that Rosa belonged to him more absolutely more completely than at any time heretofore so he held her close He caressed her gently he voiced those tender intimate foolish thoughts which he had never dared express This velvet darkness this utter isolation seemed to unite them to feel the girl s heart beating against his own and her breath warm upon his cheek was intensely thrilling An exquisite ardor inflamed him and Rosa responded to it They resisted briefly prolonging the delights of this moment then her arms crept about him her lips met his in absolute surrender They began to whisper cautiously so as not to disturb the sleeping boy they became unconscious of the flight of time Rosa lay relaxed against her lover s shoulder and in halting murmurs interrupted many times by caresses she told O Reilly of her need for him and her utter happiness It was the fullest hour of their lives Sometimes he thought she must be dozing but he was never sure for she answered to his lightest touch and awoke to the faintest pressure of his lips The night wore swiftly on and it was not long enough for either of them With daylight Morin routed out his men There was a sleepy muttering the patter of bare feet upon the deck above then the creak of blocks as the sails were raised From forward came the sound of some one splitting wood to kindle the charcoal fire for breakfast Other sailing craft seemed to be getting under way and a fishing boat loaded with the night s catch came to anchor alongside The three brothers Villar felt the schooner heel slightly and knew that she was stealing toward the Spanish gunboat which was supposed to be on guard against precisely such undertakings as this A few moments then there came a hail which brought their hearts into their throats Morin himself answered the call Good morning countryman Have you caught any of those accursed filibusters since I saw you last So Cayo Romano eh Well they come in the night and they go in the night If I were the pilot of your ship I d guarantee to put you where they d fall into your arms for I know these waters What have I aboard Morin laughed loudly You know very well cannon and shot for the rebels of course Will you look No Then a cup of coffee perhaps O Reilly peeped through a dirt stained cabin window and saw that the volandra was slipping past the stern of the ironclad so he withdrew his head quickly In spite of his hospitable invitation Captain Morin made no move to come about but instead held his schooner on its course meanwhile exchanging shouts with the unseen speaker It seemed incredible that Spanish discipline could be so lax that the schooner would be allowed to depart even for a coastwise run without some formalities of clearance but so it seemed Evidently the Spaniards had tired of examining these small craft It was typical of their carelessness Of course this was but one danger past and there were many more ahead for Morin s schooner was liable to be stopped by any of the numerous patrol boats on duty to the eastward Nevertheless when an anxious hour had gone by and she was well out toward the harbor mouth the refugees told one another they were safe Morin shoved back the companionway hatch and thrust a grinning face into view Ho there my lazy little cousins he cried Wake up for I smell
