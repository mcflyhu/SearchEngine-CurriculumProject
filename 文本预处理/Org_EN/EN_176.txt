The uneasy wait continued for a moment or more The whisper of Joe Pollard to his daughter barely reached the ear of Terry Cut in between em girl You can handle em I can t She responded instantly before Terry recovered from his shock of surprise Slim keep away from your gun She spoke as she whirled from her chair to her feet It was strange to see her direct all her attention to Slim when Phil Marvin seemed the one about to draw I ain t even nearin my gun asserted Slim truthfully It s Phil that s got a strangle hold on his You re waiting for him to draw said the girl calmly enough I know you Slim Phil don t be a fool drop your hand away from that gat He hesitated she stepped directly between him and his enemy of the moment and jerked the gun from its holster Then she faced Slim Obviously Phil was not displeased to have the matter taken out of his hands obviously Slim was not so pleased He looked coldly up to the girl This is between him and me he protested I don t need none of your help Kate Don t you You re going to get it though Gimme that gun Slim Dugan I want a square deal he complained I figure Phil has been crooking the dice on me Bah Besides I ll give you a square deal She held out her hand for the weapon Got any doubts about me being square Slim Kate leave this to me Why Slim I wouldn t let you run loose now for a million You got that ugly look in your eyes I know you partner And to the unutterable astonishment of Terry the man pulled his gun from its holster and passed it up to her his eyes fighting hers his hand moving slowly She stepped back weighing the heavy weapons in her hands Then she faced Phil Marvin with glittering eyes It ain t the first time you been accused of queer stunts with the dice What s the straight of it Phil Been doing anything to these dice Me Sure I ain t Her glance lingered on him the least part of a second H m said the girl Maybe not Slim was on his feet eager Take a look at em Kate Take a look at them dice She held them up to the light then dropped them into a pocket of her skirt I ll look at em in the morning Slim The stuff ll be dry by that time Dry or not that s what I m going to do I won t trust lamplight Slim turned on his heel and flung himself sulkily down on the blanket fighting her with sullen eyes She turned on Phil How much d you win Nothin Just a couple of hundred Just a couple of hundred You call that nothing Phil grunted The other men leaned forward in their interest to watch the progress of the trial all saving Joe Pollard who sat with his elbows braced in sprawling fashion on the table at ease his eyes twinkling contentedly at the girl Why she refused to examine the dice at once was plain to Terry If they proved to have been gummed it would mean a gun fight with the men at a battling temperature In the morning when they had cooled down it might be a different matter Terry watched her in wonder His idea of an efficient woman was based on Aunt Elizabeth cold of eye and brain practical in methods on the ranch keen with figures The efficiency of this slip of a girl was a different matter a thing of passion of quick insight of lightning guesses He could see the play of eager emotion in her face as she studied Phil Marvin And how could she do justice Terry was baffled How long you two been playing About twenty minutes Not more n five cut in Slim hotly Shut up Slim she commanded I m running this here game Phil how many straight passes did you make Me Oh I dunno Maybe five Five straight passes said the girl Five straight passes You heard me say it growled big Phil Marvin All at once she laughed Phil give that two hundred back to Slim It came like a bolt from the blue this decision Marvin hesitated shook his head Damned if I do I don t back down I won it square Listen to me said the girl Instead of threatening as Terry expected she had suddenly become conciliatory She stepped close to him and dropped a slim hand on his burly shoulder Ain t Slim a pal of yours You and him ain t you stuck together through thick and thin He thinks you didn t win that coin square Is Slim s friendship worth two hundred to you or ain t it Besides you ain t lying down to nobody Why you big squarehead Phil don t we all know that you d fight a bull with your bare hands Who d call you yaller We d simply say you was square Phil and you know it There was a pause Phil was biting his lip scowling at Slim Slim was sneering in return It seemed that she had failed Even if she forced Phil to return the money he and Slim would hate each other as long as they lived And Terry gained a keen impression that if the hatred continued one of them would die very soon indeed Her solution of the problem was a strange one She faced them both You two big sulky babies she exclaimed Slim what did Phil do for you down in Tecomo Phil did Slim stand by you last April you know the time Why boys you re just being plain foolish Get up both of you and take a walk outside where you ll get cooled down Slim rose He and Phil walked slowly toward the door at a little distance from each other one eyeing the other shrewdly At the door they hesitated Finally Phil lurched forward and went out first Slim glided after By heaven groaned Pollard as the door closed There goes two good men Kate what put this last fool idea into your head She did not answer for a moment but dropped into a chair as though suddenly exhausted It ll work out she said at length You wait for it Well grumbled her father the mischief is working Run along to bed will you She rose wearily and started across the room But she turned before she passed out of their sight and leaned against one of the pillars Dad why you so anxious to get me out of the way What d you mean by that I got no reason Run along and don t bother me He turned his shoulder on her As for the girl she remained a moment looking thoughtfully at the broad back of Pollard Then her glance shifted and dwelt a moment on Terry with pity he wondered Good night boys When the door closed on her Joe Pollard turned his attention more fully on his new employee and when Terry suggested that it was time for him to turn in his suggestion was hospitably put to one side Pollard began talking genially of the mountains of the varmints he expected Terry to clean out and while he talked he took out a broad silver dollar and began flicking it in the air and catching it in the calloused palm of his hand Call it he interrupted himself to say to Terry Heads said Terry carelessly The coin spun up flickered at the height of its rise and rang loudly on the table You win said Pollard Well you re a lucky gent Terry but I ll go you ten you can t call it again But again Terry called heads and again the coin chimed steadied and showed the Grecian goddess The rancher doubled his bet He lost doubled lost again doubled again lost A pile of money had appeared by magic before Terry I came to work for money laughed Terry not take it away I always lose at this game sighed Joe Pollard The door opened and Phil Marvin and Slim Dugan came back talking and laughing together What d you know about that Pollard exclaimed softly She guessed right She always does Oughta be a man with a brain like she s got Here we are again He spun the coin it winked fell a streak of light and again Terry had won He began to grow excited On the next throw he lost A moment later his little pile of winnings had disappeared And now he had forgotten the face of Joe Pollard forgotten the room forgotten everything except the thick thumb that snapped the coin into the air The cold quiet passion of the gambler grew in him He was losing steadily Out of his wallet came in a steady stream the last of his winnings at Pedro s And still he played Suddenly the wallet squeezed flat between his fingers Pollard he said regretfully I m broke The other waved away the idea Break up a fine game like this because you re broke The cloudy agate eyes dwelt kindly on the face of Terry and mysteriously as well That ain t nothing Nothing between friends You don t know the style of a man I am Terry Your word is as good as your money with me I ve no security Don t talk security Think I m a moneylender This is a game Come on Five minutes later Terry was three hundred behind A mysterious providence seemed to send all the luck the way of the heavy tanned thumb of Pollard That s my limit he announced abruptly rising No no Pollard spread out his big hand on the table You got the red hoss son You can bet to a thousand He s worth that to me I won t bet a cent on him said Terry firmly Every damn cent I ve won from you ag in the hoss son That s a lot of cash if you win If you lose you re just out that much hossflesh and I ll give you a good enough cayuse to take El Sangre s place A dozen wouldn t take his place insisted Terry That so Pollard leaned back in his chair and put a hand behind his neck to support his head It seemed to Terry that the big man made some odd motion with his hidden fingers At any rate the four men who lounged on the farther side of the room now rose and slowly drifted in different directions Oregon Charlie wandered toward the door Slim sauntered to the window behind the piano and stood idly looking out into the night Phil Marvin began to examine a saddle hanging from a peg on one of the posts and finally chunky Marty
