II The next day Roddy and Peter sailed for Willemstad the chief port and the capital of the tiny island colony of Holland In twelve hours they had made their land fall and were entering the harbor mouth The sun was just rising and as its rays touched the cliff from which twelve hours later Se ora Rojas and her daughters would look toward Porto Cabello they felt a thrill of possible adventure Roddy knew that as a refuge for revolutionists exiled from Venezuela Willemstad was policed with secret agents of Alvarez and he knew that were these spies to learn that during his visit either he or Peter had called upon the family of Rojas they would be reported to Caracas as suspect and the chance of their saving the Lion of Valencia would be at an end So it became them to be careful Before leaving Porto Cabello Roddy had told McKildrick the foreman of the Construction Company s work there that some boxes of new machinery and supplies for his launch had gone astray and that he wished permission to cross to Cura ao to look them up McKildrick believed the missing boxes were only an excuse for a holiday but he was not anxious to assert his authority over the son and heir of the F C C and so gave Roddy his leave of absence And at the wharf at Porto Cabello while waiting for the ship to weigh anchor Roddy had complained to the custom house officials at having to cross to Cura ao He gave them the same reason for the trip and said it was most annoying In order to be consistent when on landing at Willemstad three soiled individuals approached Roddy and introduced themselves as guides he told them the same story He was looking for boxes of machinery invoiced for Porto Cabello he feared they had been carried on to La Guayra or dropped at Willemstad Could they direct him to the office of the steamship line and to the American Consul One of the soiled persons led him across the quay to the office of the agent and while Roddy repeated his complaint listened so eagerly that to both Peter and Roddy it was quite evident the business of the guide was not to disclose Cura ao to strangers but to learn what brought strangers to Cura ao The agent was only too delighted to serve the son of one who in money [Pg ]meant so much to the line For an hour he searched his books his warehouse and the quays But naturally the search was unsuccessful and with most genuine apologies Roddy left him saying that at the office of the American Consul he would continue his search for the lost boxes Meanwhile Peter in his character of tourist engaged rooms for them at the Hotel Commercial and started off alone to explore the town At the Consulate the soiled person listened to the beginning of Roddy s speech and then apparently satisfied he had learned all that was necessary retreated to the outer office The Consul promptly rose and closed the door The representative of the United States was an elderly man of unusual height with searching honest blue eyes under white eyebrows His hair was white his beard worn long was white and his clothes were of white duck His name was Sylvanus Cobb Codman with the added title of captain which he had earned when as a younger man he had been owner and master of one of the finest whalers that ever cleared the harbor of New Bedford During his cruises he had found the life of the West Indies much to his liking and when at the age of fifty he ceased to follow the sea he had asked for an appointment as consul to Porto Cabello Since then except when at home on leave at Fairhaven he had lived in the Spanish Americas and at many ports had served the State Department faithfully and well In spite of his age Captain Codman gave a pleasant impression of strength and nervous energy Roddy felt that the mind and body of the man were as clean as his clothes and that the Consul was one who could be trusted As Captain Codman seated himself behind his desk he was frowning You must look out for that guide he said He is from Caracas He is an agent of Alvarez It just shows he went on impatiently what little sense these spies have that he didn t recognize your name The Forrester Construction Company is certainly well enough known That the son of your father should be spied on is ridiculous Then again said Roddy mysteriously maybe it isn t I haven t got such a clean bill of health That s why I came to you With an air which he considered was becoming in a conspirator he lowered his voice May I ask sir he said if you are acquainted with Se ora Rojas who is in exile here The blue eyes of the Consul opened slightly but he answered with directness I am I have that honor And with her daughters added Roddy anxiously With dignity the Consul inclined his head I want very much to meet them her corrected Roddy I am going to set her husband free For a moment as though considering whether he were not confronted by a madman the Consul regarded Roddy with an expression of concern Then in the deprecatory tone of one who believes he has not heard aright he asked You are going to do what I am going to help General Rojas to escape Roddy went on briskly myself and another fellow But we are afraid he won t trust himself to us so I am over here to get credentials from his wife But you see I have first got to get credentials to her So I came to ask you if you d sort of vouch for me tell her who I am and all that The Consul was staring at him so strangely that Roddy believed he had not made himself fully understood You know what I mean he explained Credentials something he will know came from her a ring or a piece of paper saying These are friends Go with them Or a lock of her hair or or you know urged Roddy in embarrassment credentials Are you jesting asked the older man coldly Roddy felt genuinely uncomfortable He was conscious he was blushing Certainly not he protested It is serious enough isn t it The voice of the Consul dropped to a whisper Who sent you here he demanded Without waiting for an answer he suddenly rose Moving with surprising lightness to the door he jerked it open But if by this man uvre he expected to precipitate the spy into the room he was disappointed for the outer office was empty The Consul crossed it quickly to the window He saw the spy disappearing into a neighboring wine shop When Captain Codman again entered the inner office he did not return to his seat but after closing the door as though to shut Roddy from the only means of escape he stood with his back against it He was very much excited Mr Forrester he began angrily I don t know who is back of you and he cried violently I don t mean to know I have been American Consul in these Central American countries for fifteen years and I have never mixed myself up with what doesn t concern me I represent the United States government I don t represent anything else I am not down here to assist any corporation no matter how rich any junta any revolutionary party Here Wait cried Roddy anxiously You don t understand I am not a revolution There is only me and Peter What is that snapped the Consul savagely The exclamation was like the crack of a flapping jib You see it s this way began Roddy He started to explain elaborately Peter and I belong to the Secret Order Stop thundered the Consul I tell you I won t listen to you The rebuff was most embarrassing Ignorant as to how he had offended the Consul and uncertain as to whether the Consul had not offended him Roddy helplessly rubbed his handkerchief over his perplexed and perspiring countenance He wondered if as a conspirator he had not been lacking in finesse if he had not been too communicative In the corner of the room in a tin cage a great green parrot with its head cocked on one side had been regarding Roddy with mocking malevolent eyes Now to further add to his discomfiture it suddenly emitted a chuckle human and contemptuous As though choking with hidden laughter the bird gurgled feebly Polly Polly And then in a tone of stern disapproval added briskly You talk too much At this flank attack Roddy flushed indignantly He began to wish he had brought Peter with him to give him the proper signals With his hands clinched behind him and tossing his white beard from side to side the Consul paced the room So that is it he muttered That is why he left Paris That explains the Restaurador Of course he added indignantly as he passed Roddy throwing the words at him over his shoulder that is where the money came from Roddy now thoroughly exasperated protested warmly Look here he cried if you aren t careful you ll tell me something you don t want me to know The Consul came to an instant pause From his great height he stood staring at his visitor the placid depths of his blue eyes glowering with doubt and excitement I give you my word continued Roddy sulkily I don t know what you are talking about Do you mean to tell me demanded the old man truculently that you are not Mr Forrester s son Certainly I am his son cried Roddy Then returned the Consul perhaps you will deny he is suing Alvarez for two million dollars gold you will deny that he might get it if Alvarez were thrown out you will deny that a a certain person might ratify the concession and pay your father for the harbor improvements he has already made You see exclaimed the Consul triumphantly And these missing boxes he cried as though following up an advantage shall I tell you what is in them He lowered his voice Cartridges and rifles Do you deny it Roddy found that at last he was on firm ground Of course I deny it he answered because there are no boxes They re only an invention of mine to get me to Cura ao Now you let me talk The Consul retreated behind his desk and as Roddy spoke regarded him sternly and with open suspicion In concluding his story Roddy said We have no other object in saving General Rojas than that he s an old man that he s dying and that Peter and I can t sleep of nights for thinking of him lying in a damp cell not three hundred yards from us coughing himself to death [Pg ]At the words the eyes of the Consul closed quickly he pressed his great tanned freckled fingers nervously against his lip But instantly the stern look of the cross examiner returned Go on he commanded If we have cut in on some one s private wire continued Roddy it s an accident and when you talk about father recovering two million dollars you are telling me things I don t know Father is not a chatty person He has often said to me that the only safe time to talk of what you are doing or are going to do is when you have done it So if the Venezuelan government owes the Forrester Construction Company two millions and father s making a fight for it I am probably the last person in the world he would talk to about it All I know is that he pays me twenty dollars a week to plant buoys But out of working hours I can do as I please and my friend and I please to get General Rojas out of prison Roddy rose smiling pleasantly So if you won t introduce me to Se ora Rojas he concluded I guess I will have to introduce myself With an angry gesture the Consul motioned him to be seated From his manner it was evident that Captain Codman was uncertain whether Roddy was or was not to be believed that in his perplexity he was fearful of saying too much or too little Either the old man exclaimed angrily you are a very clever young man or you are extremely ignorant Either he went on with increasing indignation they have sent you here to test me or you know nothing and you are blundering in where other men are doing work If you know nothing you are going to upset the plans of those men In any case I will have nothing further to do with you I wash my hands of you Good morning Then as though excusing himself he added sharply Besides you talk too much Roddy deeply hurt answered with equal asperity That is what your parrot thinks Maybe you are both wrong When Roddy had reached the top of the stairs leading to the street and was on the point of disappearing the Consul called sharply to him and followed into the hall Before you go the old man whispered earnestly I want you clearly to understand my position toward the Rojas family When I was Consul in Porto Cabello General Rojas became the best friend I had Since I have been stationed here it has been my privilege to be of service to his wife His daughters treat me as kindly as though I were their own grandfather No man on earth could wish General Rojas free as much as I wish it The voice of Captain Codman trembled For an instant his face as though swept with sudden pain twisted in strange lines No one he protested could wish to serve him as I do but I warn you if you go on with this you will land in prison yourself and you will bring General Rojas to his death Take my advice and go back to Porto Cabello and keep out of politics Or what is better go home You are too young to understand the Venezuelans and if you stay here you are going to make trouble for many people For your father and for for many people As though with the hope of finally dissuading Roddy he added ominously And these Venezuelans have a nasty trick of sticking a knife Oh you go to the devil retorted Roddy As he ran down the dark stairs and out into the glaring street he heard faintly the voice of the parrot pursuing him with mocking and triumphant jeers The Consul returned slowly to his office and sinking into his chair buried his face in his great knotty hands and bent his head upon the table [Pg ]A ray of sunshine filtering through the heavy Venetian blinds touched the white hair and turned it into silver For a short space save for the scratching of the parrot at the tin bars of his cage and the steady drip drip of the water jar there was no sound then the voice of the sea captain as many times before it had been raised in thanksgiving in the meeting house in Fairhaven and from the deck of his ship as she drifted under the Southern Cross was lifted in entreaty The blue eyes as the old man raised them were wet his bronzed fists fiercely interlocked Oh Thou he prayed who walked beside me on the waters make clear to me what I am to do I am old but I pray Thee to let me live to see Thine enemies perish to see those who love Thee reunited once more happy at home If in Thy wisdom even as Thou sent forth David against Goliath Thou hast sent this child against Thine enemies make that clear to me His speech is foolish but his heart seems filled with pity What he would do I would do But the way is very dark If I serve this boy may I serve Thee Teach me Outside the Consulate Roddy found his convoy the guide waiting for him and to allay the suspicion of that person gave him a cable to put on the wire for McKildrick It read No trace of freight it may come next steamer will wait He returned to the agent of the line and told him he now believed the freight had been left behind in New York and that he would remain in Willemstad until the arrival of the next steamer which was due in three days At the hotel he found Peter anxiously awaiting him Having locked themselves in the room the two conspirators sat down to talk things over From what had escaped the Consul Roddy pointed out certain facts that seemed evident Alvarez had not paid the Forrester Construction Company or in a word his father for the work already completed in the last two years His father in order to obtain his money was interested in some scheme to get rid of Alvarez and in his place put some one who would abide by the terms of the original concession This some one might be Rojas and then again might not As Peter suggested the Construction Company might prefer to back a candidate for president who while he might not be so welcome to the Venezuelans would be more amenable to the wishes of the F C C It also would probably prefer to assist a man younger than Rojas one more easily controlled perhaps one [Pg ]less scrupulously honest It also seemed likely that if by revolution the men of the Construction Company intended to put in the field a candidate of their own they would choose one with whom they could consult daily not one who while he might once have been a popular idol had for the last two years been buried from the sight of man and with whom it now was impossible to communicate The longer they discussed the matter the more sure they became that Rojas could not be the man for whom the Construction Company was plotting If Rojas isn t the choice of the F C C argued Roddy his being free or in prison does not interest them in the least While on the other hand if Rojas is the candidate father is backing the sooner he is out of prison the better for everybody Anyway added Roddy with the airy fatalism of one who nails his banner to the mast if my father is going to lose two millions because you and I set an old man free then father is going to lose two millions Having arrived at this dutiful conclusion Roddy proposed that covertly in the guise of innocent sight seers they should explore the town and from a distance reconnoitre the home of Se ora Rojas They accordingly hired one of the public landaus of Willemstad and told the driver to show them the places of interest But in Willemstad there are no particular places of interest It is the place itself that is of interest It is not like any other port in the world It used to be Roddy pointed out that every comic opera had one act on a tropical island Then some fellow discovered Holland and now all comic operas run to blonde girls in patched breeches and wooden shoes and the back drops are Rotterdam Amsterdam any damn place at all But this town combines both the ancient and modern schools Its scene is from Miss Hook of Holland and the girls are out of Bandanna Land Willemstad is compact and tiny with a miniature governor and palace It is painted with all the primary colors and though rain seldom falls on Cura ao Island it is as clean as though the minute before it had been washed by a spring shower and put out in the sun to dry Saint Ann Bay which is the harbor of Willemstad is less of a bay than a canal On entering it a captain from his bridge can almost see what the people in the houses on either bank are eating for breakfast These houses are modeled like those that border the canals of The Hague They have the same peaked roofs the front running in steps to a point the flat fa ades the many stories But they are painted in the colors of tropical Spanish America in pink yellow cobalt blue and behind the peaked points are scarlet tiles Under the southern sun they are so brilliant so theatrical so unreal that they look like the houses of a Noah s Ark fresh from the toy shop There are two towns Willemstad and joined to it by bridges Otrabanda It is on the Willemstad side that the ships tie up and where from the deck to the steamer one can converse quite easily with the Monsanto brothers in their drawing room or with the political exiles on the balconies of the Hotel Commercial The streets are narrow and like the streets of Holland paved with round cobblestones as clean as a pan of rolls just ready for the oven Willemstad is the cleanest port in the West Indies It is the Spotless Town of the tropics Beyond the town are the orange plantations and the favorite drive is from Willemstad through these orange trees around the inner harbor or the Schottegat to Otrabanda and so back across the drawbridge of Good Queen Emma into Willemstad It is a drive of little over two hours and Roddy and Peter found it altogether charming About three miles outside of Willemstad they came upon the former home of a rich Spanish planter which had been turned into a restaurant and which once the Groot du Crot was now the Caf Ducrot There is little shade on the Island of Cura ao and the young men dived into the shadows of the Ducrot garden as into a cool bath Through orange trees and spreading palmettos flowering bushes and a tangle of vines they followed paths of pebbles and wandered in a maze in which they lost themselves It is the enchanted garden of the sleeping princess said Peter And there are her sleeping attendants he added pointing at two waiters who were slumbering peacefully their arms stretched out upon the marble top tables It seemed heartless to awaken them and the young men explored further until they found a stately rambling mansion where a theatrical landlord with much rubbing of his hands brought them glasses and wonderful Holland gin We must remember the Caf Ducrot said Roddy as they drove on It is so quiet and peaceful Afterward they recalled his having said this and the fact caused them much amusement From the Caf Ducrot the road ran between high bushes and stunted trees that shaded it in on either side but could not shade it completely Then it turned toward Otrabanda along the cliff that overlooks the sea On the land side was a wall of dusky mesquite bushes bound together by tangled vines with here and there bending above them a wind tortured cocoanut palm On the east side of the road at great distances apart were villas surrounded by groves of such hardy trees and plants as could survive the sweep of the sea winds If we ask the driver whispered Roddy who lives in each house he won t suspect we are looking for any one house in particular Accordingly as they drew up even with a villa they rivaled each other in exclaiming over its beauty And the driver his local pride becoming more and more gratified gave them the name of the owner of the house and his history As he approached a villa all of white stucco with high white pillars rising to the flat roof of the tropics he needed no prompting but with the air of one sure of his effect pulled his horses to a halt and pointed with his whip That house gentle mans he said belongs to Se ora Rojas Though the house was one hundred yards from the road as though fearful of being overheard the negro spoke in an impressive whisper She is the lady of General Rojas He is a great General gentle mans and now he be put in prison President Alvarez he put that General Rojas in prison down in the water an he chain him to the rock an he put that lady in exile President Alvarez he be very bad man Every day at six o clock that lady and the young ladies they stand on that cliff and pray for that General Rojas You like me to drive you gentle mans out here at six o clock he inquired insinuatingly an see those ladies pray Certainly not exclaimed Roddy indignantly But Peter more discreet yawned and stirred impatiently I am just dying for something to eat he protested Let her out driver For appearance s sake they drove nearly to the outskirts of Otrabanda and then as though perversely Roddy declared he wanted to drive back the way they had come and breakfast at the Caf Ducrot Why should we eat in a hot smelly dining room he demanded in tones intended to reach the driver when we can eat under orange trees Peter with apparent reluctance assented Oh have it your own way he said Personally I could eat under any tree under a gallows tree For the second time they passed the Casa Blanca and while apparently intent on planning an extensive breakfast their eyes photographed its every feature Now as the driver was not observing them they were able to note the position of the entrances of the windows rising behind iron bars from a terrace of white and black marble They noted the wing used as a stable for horses and carriages and what was of greater interest that a hand rail disappeared over the edge of the cliff and suggested a landing pier below But of those who lived in the white palace there was no sign It hurt Roddy to think that if from the house the inmates noted the two young men in a public carriage peering at their home they would regard the strangers only as impertinent sighters They could not know that the eyes of the tourists were filled with pity that at the sight of the villa on the cliff the heart of each had quickened with kindly emotions with excitement with the hope of possible adventure Roddy clutched Peter by the wrist with the other hand he pointed quickly Through a narrow opening in a thicket that stood a few rods from the house Peter descried the formal lines of a tennis court Roddy raised his eyebrows significantly His smile was radiant triumphant Which seems to prove he remarked enigmatically that certain parties of the first part are neither aged nor infirm His deduction gave him such satisfaction that when they drew up at the Caf Ducrot he was still smiling Within the short hour that had elapsed since they had last seen the Ducrot garden a surprising transformation had taken place No longer the orange grove lay slumbering in silence No longer the waiters dozed beside the marble topped tables Drawn up outside the iron fence that protected the garden from the road a half dozen fiery Venezuelan ponies under heavy saddles and as many more fastened to landaus and dog carts were neighing squealing jangling their silver harness and stamping holes in the highway On the inside through the heavy foliage of the orange trees came the voice of the ma tre d h tel from the kitchen the fat chef bellowed commands The pebbles on the walks grated harshly beneath the flying feet of the waiters Seated at breakfast around a long table in the far end of the garden were over twenty men and that it was in their service the restaurant had roused itself was fairly evident The gentlemen who made up the breakfast party were not the broadly built blonde Dutchmen of the island but Venezuelans And a young and handsome Venezuelan seated at the head of the table and facing the entrance to the garden was apparently the person in whose honor they were assembled So much younger at least in looks than the others was the chief guest that Peter who was displeased by this invasion of their sleeping palace suggested it was a coming of age party It was some time before the signals of the Americans were regarded Although they had established themselves at a table surrounded by flowering shrubs and yet strategically situated not too far distant from the kitchen or the caf no one found time to wait upon them and they finally obtained the services of one of the waiters only by the expedient of holding tightly to his flying apron Roddy commanded him to bring whatever was being served at the large table That cook Roddy pointed out is too excited to bother with our order but if there s enough for twenty there will be enough for two more Although they were scorned by the waiters the young men were surprised to find that to the gentlemen of the birthday party their coming was of the utmost interest and though the tables were much too far apart for Roddy to hear what was said he could see that many glances were cast in his direction that the others were talking of him and that for some reason his presence was most disconcerting Finally under pretence of giving an order to his coachman one of the birthday party both in going and returning from the gate walked close to their table and observed them narrowly As he all but paused in the gravel walk opposite them Roddy said with conviction No Walter Pater never gave the Stoic philosophy a just interpretation while to Euphuism On the contrary interrupted Peter warmly Oscar Hammerstein is the only impressario who can keep the pennant flying over grand opera and a roof garden Believe me With a bewildered countenance the Venezuelan hastily passed on Placidly the two young men continued with their breakfast Even if he does understand English continued Roddy that should keep him guessing for a while As they themselves had no interest in the birthday party and as they had eaten nothing since early coffee on the steamer the young men were soon deep in the joy of feasting But they were not long to remain in peace From the bushes behind them there emerged suddenly and quietly a young negro He was intelligent looking and of good appearance His white duck was freshly ironed his straw hat sported a gay ribbon Without for an instant hesitating between the two men he laid a letter in front of Roddy For Mr Forrester he said and turning parted the bushes and as quickly as he had come departed Roddy stared at the hedge through which the messenger had vanished and his wandering eyes turned toward the birthday party He found that every one at that table was regarding him intently It was evident all had witnessed the incident Roddy wondered if it were possible that the letter came from them Looking further he observed that the man who was serving Peter and himself also was regarding him with greater interest than seemed natural and that he was not the man who first had waited upon them You began Roddy doubtfully you are not the waiter who The man shrugged his shoulders That fellow he can t speakety English he explained I speakety English very good The man smiled knowingly so it seemed to Roddy impertinently Roddy felt uncomfortably convinced that some jest was going on behind his back and he resented the thought Yes he began hotly and I will bet you understand it too Under the table Peter kicked violently at his ankles Read your letter he said The envelope bore only the name Rodman Forrester The letter began abruptly and was not signed It read Willemstad is a small place Every one in it knows every one else Therefore the most conspicuous person in it is the last person to arrive You are the last person to arrive and accordingly everything you do is noted That this morning you twice passed the Casa Blanca has been already reported both by those who guard it and by those who spy upon it If you would bring disaster to those you say you wish to serve keep on as idiotically as you have begun The rebuke although anonymous turned Roddy s cheeks a rosy red but he had sufficient self control to toss the letter to his companion and to say carelessly He wants us to dine with him The waiter who had been openly listening moved off in the direction of the kitchen A moment later Roddy saw him bear a dish to the Venezuelan at the head of the long table and as he proffered it the two men whispered eagerly When Peter had read the warning he threw it face down upon the table and with a disturbed countenance pretended to devote his attention to the salad dressing Roddy was now grinning with pleasure and made no effort to conceal that fact I wouldn t have missed this he whispered for a week in God s country Apparently everybody s business is everybody else s business and every one spies on every one It s like the island where they were too proud to do their own washing so everybody took in somebody else s washing Who is it from interrupted Peter irritably the Consul Roddy nodded and laughed You may laugh protested Peter but you don t know You ve been in Venezuela only four months and Captain Codman s been here eighteen years These people don t look at things the way we do We think it s all comic opera but They re children declared Roddy tolerantly children trying to frighten you with a mask on And old man Codman he s caught it too The[Pg ] fact that he s been down here eighteen years is the only thing against him He s lost his sense of humor The idea he exclaimed of spying on us and sending us anonymous warnings Why doesn t he come to the hotel and say what he has to say Where does he think he is in Siberia Roddy chuckled and clapped his hands loudly for the waiter He was pleasantly at ease The breakfast was to his liking the orange trees shielded him from the sun and the wind from the sea stirred the flowering shrubs and filled the air with spicy pungent odors Perhaps the Consul understands them better than you do persisted Peter These revolutionists They re a pack of cards declared Roddy As Alice said to the King and Queen You re only a pack of cards As he was speaking Mr Von Amberg the agent of the steamship line with whom that morning he had been in consultation and one of the other commission merchants of Willemstad came up the gravel walk and halted at their table Both Von Amberg and his companion had but lately arrived from Holland They were big men of generous girth beaming with good health and good humor They looked like Kris Kringles in white duck In continental fashion they raised their Panama hats and bowed profusely They congratulated the young men on so soon having found their way to the Caf Ducrot and that Mr de Peyster whose name appealed to them had pronounced the cooking excellent afforded them personal satisfaction Von Amberg told the young men he had just left cards for the club at their hotel and hoped they would make use of it His launch carriage and he himself were at their disposition When Roddy invited the two merchants to join them Von Amberg thanked him politely and explained that his table was already laid for breakfast With another exchange of bows the two gentlemen continued up the twisting path and disappeared among the bushes That s what I mean exclaimed Roddy approvingly Now they are our people They have better manners perhaps than we have but they re sensible straight from the shoulder men of business They aren t spying on anybody or sending black hand letters or burying old men alive in prisons If they saw a revolution coming they wouldn t know what He was interrupted by the sudden reappearance of the men of whom he spoke They were moving rapidly in the direction of the gate and the countenance of each wore an expression of surprise and alarm While his companion passed them quickly Mr Von Amberg reluctantly hesitated and in evident perplexity and with some suspicion looked from one to the other The waiter had placed the coffee and bottles of cognac and of cura ao upon the table and Roddy hospitably moved a chair forward Won t you change your mind he said and try some of the stuff that made this island famous In spite of his evident desire to escape Von Amberg s good manners did not forsake him He bowed and raised his hat in protest I I should be very pleased some other time he stammered but now I must return to town I find to day it is not possible to breakfast here There is a large party he paused and his voice rose interrogatively Yes Roddy replied with indifference We found them here They took all the waiters away from us The nature of the answer seemed greatly to surprise Von Amberg You you are not acquainted with those gentlemen he inquired In the fashion of his country Roddy answered by another question Who are they he asked Who is the one whose health they are all the time drinking For an instant Von Amberg continued to show complete bewilderment Then he smiled broadly For him apparently the situation now possessed an aspect as amusing as it had been disturbing He made a sly face and winked jovially Oh You Americans he exclaimed You make good politicians Do not fear he added hurriedly I have seen nothing and I say nothing I do not mix myself in politics He started toward the gate then halted and with one eye closed whispered hoarsely It is all right I will say nothing Nodding mysteriously he hurried down the path Peter leaned back in his chair and chuckled delightedly There go your sensible business men he jeered running away Now what have you to say Roddy was staring blankly down the path and shook his head You can subp na me he sighed Why should they be afraid of a birthday party Why he exclaimed they were even afraid of me He didn t believe that we don t know those Venezuelans He said Roddy recapitulated he didn t mix in politics That means of course that those fellows are politicians and probably this is their fashion of holding a primary It must be the local method of floating a revolution But why should Von Amberg think we re in the plot too Because my name s Forrester Peter nodded That must be it he said Your father is in deep with these Venezuelans and everybody knows that and makes the mistake of thinking you are also I wish he exclaimed patiently your father was more confiding It is all very well for him plotting plots from the top of the Forrester Building but it makes it difficult for any one down here inside the firing line If your father isn t more careful he protested warmly Alvarez will stand us blindfolded against a wall and we ll play blind man s buff with a firing squad Peter s forebodings afforded Roddy much amusement He laughed at his friend and mocked him urging him to keep a better hold upon his sense of humor You have been down here too long yourself he said You ll be having tropic choler next I tell you you must think of them as children they re a pack of cards Maybe they are sighed Peter but as long as we don t know the game From where Peter sat with his back in their direction he could not see the Venezuelans but Roddy who was facing them now observed that they had finished their breakfast Talking gesticulating laughing they were crowding down the path He touched Peter and Peter turned in his chair to look at them At the same moment a man stepped from the bushes and halting at one side of Roddy stood with his eyes fixed upon the men of the birthday party waiting for them to approach He wore the silk cap of a chauffeur a pair of automobile goggles and a long automobile coat The attitude of the chauffeur suggested that he had come forward to learn if his employer was among those now making their departure and Roddy wondered that he had heard no automobile arrive and that he had seen none in Willemstad Except for that thought so interested was Roddy in the men who had shown so keen an interest in him that to the waiting figure he gave no further consideration The Venezuelans had found they were too many to walk abreast Some had scattered down other paths Others had spread out over the grass But the chief guest still kept to the gravel walk which led to the gate And now Roddy saw him plainly Owing to a charming quality of youth it was impossible to guess the man s age He might be under thirty He might be forty He was tall graceful and yet soldierly looking with crisp black hair clinging close to a small aristocratic head Like many Venezuelans he had the brown skin ruddy cheeks and pointed mustache of a Neapolitan His eyes were radiant liquid brilliant He was walking between two of his friends with a hand resting affectionately on the shoulder of each and though both of the men were older than himself his notice obviously flattered them They were laughing and nodding delighted approval at what he said and he was talking eagerly and smiling Roddy thought he had seldom seen a smile so winning one that carried with it so strong a personal appeal Roddy altogether approved of the young man He found him gay buoyant in appearance entirely the conquering hero the Prince Charming And even though of his charm the young man seemed to be well aware he appeared none the less a graceful gallant triumphant figure As Roddy mildly curious watched him the young man turned his head gayly from the friend on his one side to address the one on the other It was but a movement of an instant but in the short circuit of the glance Roddy saw the eyes of the young man halt As though suddenly hypnotized his lips slowly closed his white teeth disappeared the charming smile grew rigid He was regarding something to the left of Roddy and above him Roddy turned and saw the waiting figure of the chauffeur He had stepped clear of the bushes and behind the mask like goggles his eyes were fixed upon the
