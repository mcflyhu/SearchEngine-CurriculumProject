A moment later from the side door which led from the store into the main body of the hotel stepped the chunky form of Denver Pete quick and light of foot as ever He went straight to the counter and asked for matches and as the storekeeper still keeping half an eye upon the formidable figure of Larrimer turned for the matches Denver spoke softly from the side of his mouth to Terry only in the lockstep line of the prison do they learn to talk in this manner gauging the carrying power of the whisper with nice accuracy That bird s after you Crazy with booze in the head but steady in the hand One of two things Clear out right now or else say the word and I ll stay and help you get rid of him For the first time in his life fear swept over Terry fear of himself compared with which the qualm he had felt after turning from Slim Dugan that morning had been nothing For the second time in one day he was being tempted and the certainty came to him that he would kill Larrimer And what made that certainty more sure was the appearance of his nemesis Denver Pete in this crisis As though with sure scent for evil Denver had come to be present and watch the launching of Terry into a career of crime But it was not the public that Terry feared It was himself His moral determination was a dam which blocked fierce currents in him that were struggling to get free And a bullet fired at Larrimer would be the thing that burst the dam and let the flood waters of self will free Thereafter what stood in his path would be crushed and swept aside He said to Denver This is my affair not yours Stand away Denver And pray for me A strange request It shattered even the indomitable self control of Denver and left him gaping Larrimer having completed his survey of the dim interior of the store stalked down upon them He saw Terry for the first time paused and his bloodshot little eyes ran up and down the body of the stranger He turned to the storekeeper but still half of his attention was fixed upon Terry Bill he said you seen anything of a spavined long horned no good skunk named Hollis around town today And Terry could see him wait quivering half in hopes that the stranger would show some anger at this denunciation Ain t seen nobody by that name said Bill mildly Maybe you re chasing a wild goose Who told you they was a gent named Hollis around Black Jack s son insisted Larrimer Wild goose chase hell I was told he was around by a gent named These ain t the kind of matches I want cried Denver Pete with a strangely loud voiced wrath I don t want painted wood How can a gent whittle one of these damned matches down to toothpick size Gimme plain wood will you The storekeeper wondering made the exchange Drunken Larrimer had roved on forgetful of his unfinished sentence For the very purpose of keeping that sentence unfinished Denver Pete remained on the scene edging toward the outskirts Now was to come in a single moment both the temptation and the test of Terry Hollis and well Denver knew that if Larrimer fell with a bullet in his body there would be an end of Terry Hollis in the world and the birth of a new soul the true son of Black Jack It s him that plugged Sheriff Minter went on Larrimer I hear tell as how he got the sheriff from behind and plugged him This town ain t a place for a man killing houn dog like young Black Jack and I m here to let him know it The torrent of abuse died out in a crackle of curses Terry Hollis stood as one stunned Yet his hand stayed free of his gun Suppose we go on to the hotel and eat he asked Jack Baldwin softly No use staying and letting that fellow deafen us with his oaths is there Better than a circus declared Baldwin Wouldn t miss it Since old man Harkness died I ain t heard cussing to match up with Larrimer s Didn t know that he had that much brains It seemed that the fates were surely against Terry this day Yet still he determined to dodge the issue He started toward the door taking care not to walk hastily enough to draw suspicion on him because of his withdrawal but to the heated brain of Larrimer all things were suspicious His long arm darted out as Terry passed him he jerked the smaller man violently back Wait a minute I don t know you kid Maybe you got the information I want I m afraid not Terry blinked It seemed to him that if he looked again at that vicious contracted face his gun would slip into his hand of its own volition Who are you A stranger in these parts said Terry slowly and he looked down at the floor He heard a murmur from the men at the other end of the room He knew that small buzzing sound They were wondering at the calmness with which he took water So s Hollis a stranger in these parts said Larrimer facing his victim more fully What I want to know is about the gent that owns the red hoss in front of the store Ever hear of him Terry was silent By a vast effort he was able to shake his head It was hard bitterly hard but every good influence that had ever come into his life now stood beside him and fought with and for him Elizabeth Cornish the long and fictitious line of his Colby ancestors Kate Pollard with her clear seeing eyes He saw her last of all When the men were scorning him for the way he had avoided this battle she at least would understand and her understanding would be a mercy Hollis is somewhere around declared Larrimer drawing back and biting his lip I know it damn well His hoss is standing out yonder I know what ll fetch him I ll shoot that hoss of his and that ll bring him if young Black Jack is half the man they say he is I ain t out to shoot cowards I want men He strode to the door Don t do it shouted Bill the storekeeper Shut up snapped Baldwin I know something Shut up That fierce low voice reached the ear of Terry and he understood that it meant Baldwin had judged him as the whole world judged him After all what difference did it make whether he killed or not He was already damned as a slayer of men by the name of his father before him Larrimer had turned with a roar What d you mean by stopping me Bill What in hell d you mean by it With the brightness of the door behind him his bearded face was wolfish Nothing quavered Bill this torrent of danger pouring about him Except that it ain t very popular around here shooting hosses Larrimer Damn you and your ideas said Larrimer I m going to go my own way I know what s best He reached the door his hand went back to the butt of his revolver And then it snapped in Terry that last restraint which had been at the breaking point all this time He felt a warmth run through him the warmth of strength and the cold of a mysterious and evil happiness Wait Larrimer The big man whirled as though he had heard a gun there was a ring in the voice of Terry like the ring down the barrel of a shotgun after it has been cocked You agin barked Larrimer Me again Larrimer don t shoot the horse Why not For the sake of your soul my friend Boys ain t this funny This gent is a sky pilot maybe He made a long stride back Stop where you are cried Terry He stood like a soldier with his heels together straight trembling And Larrimer stopped as though a blow had checked him I may be your sky pilot Larrimer But listen to sense Do you really mean you d shoot that red horse in front of the hotel Ain t you heard me say it Then the Lord pity you Larrimer Ordinarily Larrimer s gun would have been out long before but the change from this man s humility of the moment before his almost cringing meekness to his present defiance was so startling that Larrimer was momentarily at sea Damn my eyes he remarked furiously this is funny this is Are you preaching at me kid What d you mean by that Eh I ll tell you why Face me squarely will you Your head up and your hands ready In spite of his rage and wonder Larrimer instinctively obeyed for the words came snapping out like military commands Now I ll tell you You manhunting cur I m going to send you to hell with your sins on your head I m going to kill you Larrimer It was so unexpected so totally startling that Larrimer blinked raised his head and laughed But the son of Black Jack tore away all thought of laughter Larrimer I m Terry Hollis Get your gun The wide mouth of Larrimer writhed silently from mirth to astonishment and then sinister rage And though he was in the shadow against the door Terry saw the slow gleam in the face of the tall man then his hand whipped for the gun It came cleanly out There was no flap to his holster and the sight had been filed away to give more oiled and perfect freedom to the draw Years of patient practice had taught his muscles to reflex in this one motion with a speed that baffled the eye Fast as light that draw seemed to those who watched and the draw of Terry Hollis appeared to hang in midair His hand wavered then clutched suddenly and they saw a flash of metal not the actual motion of drawing the gun Just that gleam of the barrel at his hip hardly clear of the holster and then in the dimness of the big room a spurt of flame and the boom of the gun There was a clangor of metal at the farthest end of the room Larrimer s gun had rattled on the boards unfired He tossed up his great gaunt arms as though he were appealing for help leaped into the air and fell heavily with a force that vibrated the floor where Terry stood There was one heartbeat of silence Then Terry shoved the gun slowly back into his holster and walked to the body of Larrimer To these things Bill the storekeeper and Jack Baldwin the rancher afterward swore That young Black Jack leaned a little over the corpse and then straightened and touched the fallen hand with the toe of his boot Then he turned upon them a perfectly calm unemotional look I seem to have been elected to do the scavenger work in this town he said But I m going to leave it to you gentlemen to take the carrion away Shorty I m going back to the house Are you ready to ride that way When they went to the body of Larrimer
