At the fall of night while a bad mountain squall twisted the branches of the trees Ramuntcho entered his deserted house where the gray of death seemed scattered everywhere A little of winter had passed over the Basque land a little frost burning the annual flowers ending the illusory summer of December In front of Franchita s door the geraniums the dahlias had just died and the path which led to the house which no one cared for disappeared under the mass of yellow leaves For Ramuntcho this first week of mourning had been occupied by the thousand details that rock sorrow Proud also he had desired that all should be done in a luxurious manner according to the old usages of the parish His mother had been buried in a coffin of black velvet ornamented with silver nails Then there had been mortuary masses attended by the neighbors in long capes the women enveloped and hooded with black And all this represented a great deal of expense for him who was poor Of the sum given formerly at the time of his birth by his unknown father little remained the greater part having been lost through unfaithful bankers And now he would have to quit the house sell the dear familiar furniture realize the most money possible for the flight to America This time he returned home peculiarly disturbed because he was to do a thing postponed from day to day about which his conscience was not at rest He had already examined picked out all that belonged to his mother but the box containing her papers and her letters was still intact and to night he would open it perhaps He was not sure that death as many persons think gives the right to those who remain to read letters to penetrate the secrets of those who have just gone To burn without looking seemed to him more respectful more honest But it was also to destroy forever the means of discovering the one whose abandoned son he was Then what should he do And from whom could he take advice since he had no one in the world In the large chimney he lit the evening fire then he got from an upper room the disquieting box placed it on a table near the fire beside his lamp and sat down to reflect again In the face of these papers almost sacred almost prohibited which he would touch and which death alone could have placed in his hands he had in this moment the consciousness in a more heartbreaking manner of the irrevocable departure of his mother tears returned to him and he wept there alone in the silence At last he opened the box His arteries beat heavily Under the surrounding trees in the obscure solitude he felt that forms were moving to look at him through the window panes He felt breaths strange to his own chest as if some one was breathing behind him Shades assembled interested in what he was about to do The house was crowded with phantoms They were letters preserved there for more than twenty years all in the same handwriting one of those handwritings at once negligent and easy which men of the world have and which in the eyes of the simple minded are an indication of great social difference And at first a vague dream of protection of elevation and of wealth diverted the course of his thoughts He had no doubt about the hand which had written them those letters and he held them tremblingly not daring to read them nor even to look at the name with which they were signed One only had retained its envelope then he read the address To Madame Franchita Duval Oh yes he remembered having heard that his mother at the time of her disappearance from the Basque country had taken that name for a while Following this was an indication of street and number which it pained him to read without his being able to understand why which made the blood come to his cheeks then the name of that large city wherein he was born With fixed eyes he stayed there looking no longer And suddenly he had the horrible vision of that clandestine establishment in a suburban apartment his mother young elegant mistress of some rich idler or of some officer perhaps In the regiment he had known some of these establishments which doubtless are all alike and he had found in them for himself unexpected adventures A dizziness seized him to catch a glimpse thus under a new aspect of the one whom he had venerated so much the dear past faltered behind him as if to fall into a desolating abyss And his despair turned into a sudden execration for the one who had given life to him through a caprice Oh to burn them to burn them as quickly as possible these letters of misfortune And he began to throw them one by one into the fire where they were consumed by sudden flames A photograph however came out of them fell on the floor then he could not refrain from taking it to the lamp to see it And his impression was heart rending during the few seconds when his eyes met the half effaced ones of the yellowed image It resembled him He found with profound fear something of himself in the unknown And instinctively he turned round asking himself if the spectres in the obscure corners had not come near behind him to look also It had hardly an appreciable duration that silent interview unique and supreme with his father To the fire also the image He threw it with a gesture of anger and of terror among the ashes of the last letters and all left soon only a little mass of black dust extinguishing the clear flames of the branches Finished The box was empty He threw on the floor his cap which gave him a headache and straightened himself with perspiration on his forehead and a buzzing at the temples Finished Annihilated all these memories of sin and of shame And now the things of life appeared to him to regain their former balance he regained his soft veneration for his mother whose memory it seemed to him he had purified avenged also a little by this disdainful execution Therefore his destiny had been fixed to night forever He would remain the Ramuntcho of other
