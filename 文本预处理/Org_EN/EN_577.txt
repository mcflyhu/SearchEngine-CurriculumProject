The next day Friday was organized the departure for this village where the festival was to take place on the following Sunday It is situated very far in a shady region at the turn of a deep gorge at the foot of very high summits Arrochkoa was born there and he had spent there the first months of his life in the time when his father lived there as a brigadier of the French customs but he had left too early to have retained the least memory of it In the little Detcharry carriage Gracieuse Pantchita and with a long whip in her hand Madame Dargaignaratz her mother who is to drive leave together at the noon angelus to go over there directly by the mountain route Ramuntcho Arrochkoa and Florentino who have to settle smuggling affairs at Saint Jean de Luz go by a roundabout way which will bring them to Erribiague at night on the train which goes from Bayonne to Burguetta To day all three are heedless and happy Basque caps never appeared above more joyful faces The night is falling when they penetrate by this little train of Burguetta into the quiet interior country The carriages are full of a gay crowd a spring evening crowd returning from some festival young girls with silk kerchiefs around their necks young men wearing woolen caps all are singing laughing and kissing In spite of the invading obscurity one may still distinguish the hedges white with hawthorn the woods white with acacia flowers into the open carriages penetrates a fragrance at once violent and suave which the country exhales And on all this white bloom of April which the night little by little effaces the train throws in passing a furrow of joy the refrain of some old song of Navarre sung and resung infinitely by these girls and these boys in the noise of the wheels and of the steam Erribiague At the doors this name which makes all three start is cried The singing band had already stepped out leaving them almost alone in the train which had become silent High mountains had made the night very thick and the three were almost sleeping Astounded they jump down in the midst of an obscurity which even their smugglers eyes cannot pierce Stars above hardly shine so encumbered is the sky by the overhanging summits Where is the village they ask of a man who is there alone to receive them Three miles from here on the right They begin to distinguish the gray trail of a road suddenly lost in the heart of the shade And in the grand silence in the humid coolness of these valleys full of darkness they walk without talking their gaiety somewhat darkened by the black majesty of the peaks that guard the frontier here They come at last to an old curved bridge over a torrent then to the sleeping village which no light indicates And the inn where shines a lamp is near by leaning on the mountain its base in the roaring water The young men are led into their little rooms which have an air of cleanliness in spite of their extreme oldness very low crushed by their enormous beams and bearing on their whitewashed walls images of the Christ the Virgin and the saints Then they go down to the supper tables where are seated two or three old men in old time costume white belt black blouse very short with a thousand pleats And Arrochkoa vain of his parentage hastens to ask them if they have not known Detcharry who was here a brigadier of the customs eighteen years ago One of the old men scans his face Ah you are his son I would bet You look like him Detcharry do I remember Detcharry He took from me two hundred lots of merchandise That does not matter here is my hand even if you are his son And the old defrauder who was the chief of a great band without rancor with effusion presses Arrochkoa s two hands Detcharry has remained famous at Erribiague for his stratagems his ambuscades his captures of contraband goods out of which came later his income that Dolores and her children enjoy And Arrochkoa assumes a proud air while Ramuntcho lowers his head feeling that he is of a lower condition having no father Are you not in the customhouse as your deceased father was continued the old man in a bantering tone Oh no not exactly Quite the reverse even Oh well I understand Then shake once more and it s a sort of revenge on Detcharry for me to know that his son has gone into smuggling like us They send for cider and they drink together while the old men tell again the exploits and the tricks of former times all the ancient tales of nights in the mountains they speak a variety of Basque different from that of Etchezar the village where the language is preserved more clearly articulated more incisive more pure perhaps Ramuntcho and Arrochkoa are surprised by this accent of the high land which softens the words and which chants them those white haired story tellers seem to them almost strangers whose talk is a series of monotonous stanzas repeated infinitely as in the antique songs expressive of sorrow And as soon as they cease talking the slight sounds in the sleep of the country come from peaceful and fresh darkness The crickets chirp one hears the torrent bubbling at the base of the inn one hears the dripping of springs from the terrible overhanging summits carpeted with thick foliage It sleeps the very small village crouched and hidden in the hollow of a ravine and one has the impression that the night here is a night blacker than elsewhere and more mysterious In truth concludes the old chief the customhouse and smuggling at bottom resemble each other it is a game where the smartest wins is it not I will even say that in my own opinion an officer of customs clever and bold a customs officer like your father for example is as worthy as any of us After this the hostess having come to say that it was time to put out the lamp the last lamp still lit in the village they go away the old defrauders Ramuntcho and Arrochkoa go up to their rooms lie down and sleep always in the chirp of the crickets always in the sound of fresh waters that run or that fall And Ramuntcho as in his house at Etchezar hears vaguely during his sleep the tinkling of bells attached to the necks of cows moving in a dream under him in the stable situated adj The
