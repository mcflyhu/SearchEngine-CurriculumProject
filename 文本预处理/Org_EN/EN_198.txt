I could not speak when I reached the village They gave me water I had in any case to wait a moment till the postmaster was free for I could not use the telephone myself My mother had a horror of our touching the public one She had spoken with disgust of the mouthpiece that everybody breathed into Full of germs Then it must be bad for other people we said Other people must take their chance I remembered that as I leaned against the counter panting while the postmaster wrote out a telegram We were taking the chance now Such a little thing my not knowing how to telephone Yet it might cost my mother her life The postmaster rang up Brighton The doctor was out What could be done but leave a message I would go to the Helmstones and ask for a motor car Why had I not thought of that before [Pg ] Then the postmaster said that the Helmstones had all left for London that morning He had seen them go by Two motors full He recommended the doctor at Littlecombe If I waited a while the baker s cart would come back from its rounds and I could send or go myself with the driver to Littlecombe Wait There was that at Duncombe that would not wait For me too waiting was the one impossible thing I cast about in my distracted mind That new acquaintance of the Helmstones Was he not a sort of a doctor The scientific chap as his lordship called the man who had taken rooms at Big Klaus s farm Lord Helmstone had complained of his Scotch arrogance frankly astonished if a Southron makes a decent drive We had not seen him at least not to distinguish an arrogant Scot from other golfers I ran most of the way to the farm As I stood waiting for the door to open a man came up the path with golf clubs Tallish In careless clothes otherwise of a very un careless aspect In those seconds of watching the figure come up the pathway with a sort of rigidity of[Pg ] gait I received an impression of something so restrained and chilling that I hoped he was not the man I had come for In any case this was not a person before whom one would care to show emotion I asked if he were Mr Annan Yes his name was Annan His tone asked and what business was it of mine But he halted there below me as I stood on the step explaining very briefly my errand He did not want to come I could see that He made some excuse about not being a general practitioner I was sorry I had spoken in that self possessed way I saw I had given him no idea of the urgency of our need I had to explain that all we asked of him was to give some help at once And only for once Our regular doctor would be with us very soon He seemed slow witted for he stood there several seconds with one free hand pulling at his rough moustache of reddish brown We mustn t lose time I said As I led the way I heard the door open behind me and the sound of golf clubs thrown down in a stone passage [Pg ] He caught up with me at the gate and we walked rapidly across Big Klaus s fields While we were going by the pond in the lower meadow a moorhen scuttled to her nest in the tangle on the bank Her creaking cry had always sounded so cheerful since my mother pointed out that the mechanic click click was like a Christmas toy To day I knew it for a warning The man had caught up a stick He struck sharply with it as he passed at the tall nettles growing in the ditch What was happening at home all this time I began to walk faster with a great misery at my heart What was the good of this man who wasn t a general practitioner He was too like all the other broad shouldered young golfers in Norfolk jackets far too like them to help in so dire a need as ours I tried to hearten myself by recalling what Lord Helmstone had said of him That the bigwigs in the world of science spoke of Annan with enthusiasm An original mind A demon for work that was perhaps why he hadn t wanted to come with me Odds and ends came back Annan would go far He had gone too[Pg ] far in the direction of overwork He had been urged to come down here and play golf Still he worked long hours And while I recalled these things in the back of my head I kept repeating Mother mother I am bringing help We did not talk except for my turning suddenly to warn him that my younger sister was not to know if my mother Yes yes he said I felt he understood I walked faster almost at a run He did not seem to notice His long strides kept him near me without an effort Mother mother Oh how wildly the birds were singing She had said that only we ever noticed the special quality in the vesper song Something the morning never heard The air was filled with a passion of that belated singing Good night I heard her say is better than good morning Oh mother if that is so for you think of your children Did the stranger object to jumping ditches and climbing stiles I am taking you the short cut I said [Pg ] Of course We were coming to the copse on the edge of the heath The hawthorn foamed along the outer fringe This was where we met Colonel Dover all those years ago Every inch of the way I saw pictures of my mother All that gentleness and beauty What a richness had been lavished on our lives I had never begun to understand it before this evening never once had thanked her Mother mother The copse was full of her Her figure went before me between the bare larch boles taking care not to tread on flowers The ground was a sheet of blue when we had last come here The time of wild hyacinths was nearly over now And her time Was that nearly over too Where would she be when the foxgloves stood tall here among the bracken The larch stems wavered and the hazels shivered The man was on in front now the first to cross the outermost stile As I hurried after him he looked back I did not know until I met his eyes that mine were wet and that I was walking not quite steadily I had run a long way that evening [Pg ] Rest a moment he said and he looked away from me and up at the flowering may The scent is very heavy he said I knew a woman once who was always made faint by it He did not look at me again But I had seen that those hard eyes could look kind Now we could see the red tile roof Underneath it what was happening I had been long gone for all my running As we came across the links the sun went down behind the wall of Duncombe garden Oh sun I prayed do not go down for ever Before I entered the house a strange thing happened A great peace fell on me I knew without asking that all was well Was that a blackcap singing And had I seen the sun go down What magic light was this then that was shining on the world He saw my mother and told us what to do [Pg ] Bettina stayed with her while I came down with Mr Annan to hear his verdict As we stood in the lower hall I looked up to find his eyes on me eyes suddenly so gentle that terror fell on me afresh You don t think she is going to die Good nursing he said will make a difference One must always hope Oh you must save us I said incoherently and then corrected My mother He seemed to accept the charge He would come back early in the morning I never found the bridge between that passion of dread about my mother s life and the strange new passion that took possession of me body and soul Like the dart
