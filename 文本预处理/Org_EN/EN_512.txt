Not until Mister Haggin abruptly picked him up under one arm and stepped into the sternsheets of the waiting whaleboat did Jerry dream that anything untoward was to happen to him Mister Haggin was Jerry s beloved master and had been his beloved master for the six months of Jerry s life Jerry did not know Mister Haggin as master for master had no place in Jerry s vocabulary Jerry being a smooth coated golden sorrel Irish terrier But in Jerry s vocabulary Mister Haggin possessed all the definiteness of sound and meaning that the word master possesses in the vocabularies of humans in relation to their dogs Mister Haggin was the sound Jerry had always heard uttered by Bob the clerk and by Derby the foreman on the plantation when they addressed his master Also Jerry had always heard the rare visiting two legged man creatures such as came on the Arangi address his master as Mister Haggin But dogs being dogs in their dim inarticulate brilliant and heroic worshipping ways misappraising humans dogs think of their masters and love their masters more than the facts warrant Master means to them as Mister Haggin meant to Jerry a deal more and a great deal more than it means to humans The human considers himself as master to his dog but the dog considers his master God Now God was no word in Jerry s vocabulary despite the fact that he already possessed a definite and fairly large vocabulary Mister Haggin was the sound that meant God In Jerry s heart and head in the mysterious centre of all his activities that is called consciousness the sound Mister Haggin occupied the same place that God occupies in human consciousness By word and sound to Jerry Mister Haggin had the same connotation that God has to God worshipping humans In short Mister Haggin was Jerry s God And so when Mister Haggin or God or call it what one will with the limitations of language picked Jerry up with imperative abruptness tucked him under his arm and stepped into the whaleboat whose black crew immediately bent to the oars Jerry was instantly and nervously aware that the unusual had begun to happen Never before had he gone out on board the Arangi which he could see growing larger and closer to each lip hissing stroke of the oars of the blacks Only an hour before Jerry had come down from the plantation house to the beach to see the Arangi depart Twice before in his half year of life had he had this delectable experience Delectable it truly was running up and down the white beach of sand pounded coral and under the wise guidance of Biddy and Terrence taking part in the excitement of the beach and even adding to it There was the nigger chasing Jerry had been born to hate niggers His first experiences in the world as a puling puppy had taught him that Biddy his mother and his father Terrence hated niggers A nigger was something to be snarled at A nigger unless he were a house boy was something to be attacked and bitten and torn if he invaded the compound Biddy did it Terrence did it In doing it they served their God Mister Haggin Niggers were two legged lesser creatures who toiled and slaved for their two legged white lords who lived in the labour barracks afar off and who were so much lesser and lower that they must not dare come near the habitation of their lords And nigger chasing was adventure Not long after he had learned to sprawl Jerry had learned that One took his chances As long as Mister Haggin or Derby or Bob was about the niggers took their chasing But there were times when the white lords were not about Then it was Ware niggers One must dare to chase only with due precaution Because then beyond the white lord s eyes the niggers had a way not merely of scowling and muttering but of attacking four legged dogs with stones and clubs Jerry had seen his mother so mishandled and ere he had learned discretion alone in the high grass had been himself club mauled by Godarmy the black who wore a china door knob suspended on his chest from his neck on a string of sennit braided from cocoanut fibre More Jerry remembered another high grass adventure when he and his brother Michael had fought Owmi another black distinguishable for the cogged wheels of an alarm clock on his chest Michael had been so severely struck on his head that for ever after his left ear had remained sore and had withered into a peculiar wilted and twisted upward cock Still more There had been his brother Patsy and his sister Kathleen who had disappeared two months before who had ceased and no longer were The great god Mister Haggin had raged up and down the plantation The bush had been searched Half a dozen niggers had been whipped And Mister Haggin had failed to solve the mystery of Patsy s and Kathleen s disappearance But Biddy and Terrence knew So did Michael and Jerry The four months old Patsy and Kathleen had gone into the cooking pot at the barracks and their puppy soft skins had been destroyed in the fire Jerry knew this as did his father and mother and brother for they had smelled the unmistakable burnt meat smell and Terrence in his rage of knowledge had even attacked Mogom the house boy and been reprimanded and cuffed by Mister Haggin who had not smelled and did not understand and who had always to impress discipline on all creatures under his roof tree But on the beach when the blacks whose terms of service were up came down with their trade boxes on their heads to depart on the Arangi was the time when nigger chasing was not dangerous Old scores could be settled and it was the last chance for the blacks who departed on the Arangi never came back As an instance this very morning Biddy remembering a secret mauling at the hands of Lerumie laid teeth into his naked calf and threw him sprawling into the water trade box earthly possessions and all and then laughed at him sure in the protection of Mister Haggin who grinned at the episode Then too there was usually at least one bush dog on the Arangi at which Jerry and Michael from the beach could bark their heads off Once Terrence who was nearly as large as an Airedale and fully as lion hearted Terrence the Magnificent as Tom Haggin called him had caught such a bush dog trespassing on the beach and given him a delightful thrashing in which Jerry and Michael and Patsy and Kathleen who were at the time alive had joined with many shrill yelps and sharp nips Jerry had never forgotten the ecstasy of the hair unmistakably doggy in scent which had filled his mouth at his one successful nip Bush dogs were dogs he recognized them as his kind but they were somehow different from his own lordly breed different and lesser just as the blacks were compared with Mister Haggin Derby and Bob But Jerry did not continue to gaze at the nearing Arangi Biddy wise with previous bitter bereavements had sat down on the edge of the sand her fore feet in the water and was mouthing her woe That this concerned him Jerry knew for her grief tore sharply albeit vaguely at his sensitive passionate heart What it presaged he knew not save that it was disaster and catastrophe connected with him As he looked back at her rough coated and grief stricken he could see Terrence hovering solicitously near her He too was rough coated as was Michael and as Patsy and Kathleen had been Jerry being the one smooth coated member of the family Further although Jerry did not know it and Tom Haggin did Terrence was a royal lover and a devoted spouse Jerry from his earliest impressions could remember the way Terrence had of running with Biddy miles and miles along the beaches or through the avenues of cocoanuts side by side with her both with laughing mouths of sheer delight As these were the only dogs besides his brothers and sisters and the several eruptions of strange bush dogs that Jerry knew it did not enter his head otherwise than that this was the way of dogs male and female wedded and faithful But Tom Haggin knew its unusualness Proper affinities he declared and repeatedly declared with warm voice and moist eyes of appreciation A gentleman that Terrence and a four legged proper man A man dog if there ever was one four square as the legs on the four corners of him And prepotent My word His blood d breed true for a thousand generations and the cool head and the kindly brave heart of him Terrence did not voice his sorrow if sorrow he had but his hovering about Biddy tokened his anxiety for her Michael however yielding to the contagion sat beside his mother and barked angrily out across the increasing stretch of water as he would have barked at any danger that crept and rustled in the jungle This too sank to Jerry s heart adding weight to his sure intuition that dire fate he knew not what was upon him For his six months of life Jerry knew a great deal and knew very little He knew without thinking about it without knowing that he knew why Biddy the wise as well as the brave did not act upon all the message that her heart voiced to him and spring into the water and swim after him She had protected him like a lioness when the big puarka which in Jerry s vocabulary along with grunts and squeals was the combination of sound or word for pig had tried to devour him where he was cornered under the high piled plantation house Like a lioness when the cook boy had struck him with a stick to drive him out of the kitchen had Biddy sprung upon the black receiving without wince or whimper one straight blow from the stick and then downing him and mauling him among his pots and pans until dragged for the first time snarling away by the unchiding Mister Haggin who however administered sharp words to the cook boy for daring to lift hand against a four legged dog belonging to a god Jerry knew why his mother did not plunge into the water after him The salt sea as well as the lagoons that led out of the salt sea were taboo Taboo as word or sound had no place in Jerry s vocabulary But its definition or significance was there in the quickest part of his consciousness He possessed a dim vague imperative knowingness that it was not merely not good but supremely disastrous leading to the mistily glimpsed sense of utter endingness for a dog for any dog to go into the water where slipped and slid and noiselessly paddled sometimes on top sometimes emerging from the depths great scaly monsters huge jawed and horribly toothed that snapped down and engulfed a dog in an instant just as the fowls of Mister Haggin snapped and engulfed grains of corn Often he had heard his father and mother on the safety of the sand bark and rage their hatred of those terrible sea dwellers when close to the beach they appeared on the surface like logs awash Crocodile was no word in Jerry s vocabulary It was an image an image of a log awash that was different from any log in that it was alive Jerry who heard registered and recognized many words that were as truly tools of thought to him as they were to humans but who by inarticulateness of birth and breed could not utter these many words nevertheless in his mental processes used images just as articulate men use words in their own mental processes And after all articulate men in the act of thinking willy nilly use images that correspond to words and that amplify words Perhaps in Jerry s brain the rising into the foreground of consciousness of an image of a log awash connoted more intimate and fuller comprehension of the thing being thought about than did the word crocodile and its accompanying image in the foreground of a human s consciousness For Jerry really did know more about crocodiles than the average human He could smell a crocodile farther off and more differentiatingly than could any man than could even a salt water black or a bushman smell one He could tell when a crocodile hauled up from the lagoon lay without sound or movement and perhaps asleep a hundred feet away on the floor mat of jungle He knew more of the language of crocodiles than did any man He had better means and opportunities of knowing He knew their many noises that were as grunts and slubbers He knew their anger noises their fear noises their food noises their love noises And these noises were as definitely words in his vocabulary as are words in a human s vocabulary And these crocodile noises were tools of thought By them he weighed and judged and determined his own consequent courses of action just like any human or just like any human lazily resolved upon no course of action but merely noted and registered a clear comprehension of something that was going on about him that did not require a correspondence of action on his part And yet what Jerry did not know was very much He did not know the size of the world He did not know that this Meringe Lagoon backed by high forested mountains and fronted and sheltered by the off shore coral islets was anything else than the entire world He did not know that it was a mere fractional part of the great island of Ysabel that was again one island of a thousand many of them greater that composed the Solomon Islands that men marked on charts as a group of specks in the vastitude of the far western South Pacific It was true there was a somewhere else or a something beyond of which he was dimly aware But whatever it was it was mystery Out of it things that had not been suddenly were Chickens and puarkas and cats that he had never seen before had a way of abruptly appearing on Meringe Plantation Once even had there been an eruption of strange four legged horned and hairy creatures the images of which registered in his brain would have been identifiable in the brains of humans with what humans worded goats It was the same way with the blacks Out of the unknown from the somewhere and something else too unconditional for him to know any of the conditions instantly they appeared full statured walking about Meringe Plantation with loin cloths about their middles and bone bodkins through their noses and being put to work by Mister Haggin Derby and Bob That their appearance was coincidental with the arrival of the Arangi was an association that occurred as a matter of course in Jerry s brain Further he did not bother save that there was a companion association namely that their occasional disappearances into the beyond was likewise coincidental with the Arangi s departure Jerry did not query these appearances and disappearances It never entered his golden sorrel head to be curious about the affair or to attempt to solve it He accepted it in much the way he accepted the wetness of water and the heat of the sun It was the way of life and of the world he knew His hazy awareness was no more than an awareness of something which by the way corresponds very fairly with the hazy awareness of the average human of the mysteries of birth and death and of the beyondness about which they have no definiteness of comprehension For all that any man may gainsay the ketch Arangi trader and blackbirder in the Solomon Islands may have signified in Jerry s mind as much the mysterious boat that traffics between the two worlds as at one time the boat that Charon sculled across the Styx signified to the human mind Out of the nothingness men came Into the nothingness they went And they came and went always on the Arangi And to the Arangi this hot white tropic morning Jerry went
