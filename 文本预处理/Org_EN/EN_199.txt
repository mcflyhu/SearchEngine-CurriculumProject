For a long time I said nothing in his presence except in answer to some direction There seemed no need to talk Enough for me to see him come striding across the links to watch him walk into my mother s room to see a certain look come into his eyes It came so seldom that sometimes I told myself I must have dreamed it Then it would come again He made my mother almost well But when he went back to London he left a great misery behind him No one knew and I hoped that in time I should get over it At least I pretended that was what I hoped I would rather have had that pain of longing than all the pleasure any other soul could give The following year my mother was wonderfully well and so cheerful I hadn t the heart to worry her with questions [Pg ] We saw more of the Helmstones than ever before My mother even went to them once or twice A few days before that first visit of Eric Annan s had ended Lady Helmstone and the two unmarried daughters came home from touring round the world in their cousin s yacht Lady Barbara was the plain daughter She was twenty two and wrote poetry we heard But we thought the youngest of the family much the cleverest Hermione was striking to look at and the fact that she laughed at Barbara and at pretty well everyone else made her seem very superior Also she had an air She made a deep impression on Bettina I too found her wonderful But my mother said she was crude We thought that was only because in spite of being who she was Hermione Helmstone put pink stuff on her lips and darkened the under lid of her green eyes Just a little you understand Enough to give her a look of extraordinary brilliancy She took a great fancy to Bettina In spite of Bettina s being so young Hermione used to tell her about her love affairs There seemed to be a great many But one was serious She was as good as engaged she[Pg ] said to Guy Whitby Dawson He was in the Guards We were all agog When was she going to be married She didn t know It was dreadfully expensive being in the Guards Being a peer seemed to be very expensive too Hermione s father had so many places to keep up and so many daughters he couldn t afford to give Hermione more than the merest pittance When we heard what it was we thought it very grand to call such a provision a mere pittance I wished we three had a pittance For those two to try to live on it would be madness Hermione said So she and Guy would have to wait Perhaps some of Guy s relations would die Then he would have plenty Meanwhile in spite of being as good as engaged Hermione flirted a good deal with her cousin Eddie Monmouth and with the various other young men who came to the week end parties and for the hunting Bettina and I were often rather sorry for Guy until the day when Hermione brought over some of his photographs[Pg ] for us to look at We did not admire him at all But we never told Hermione As for me though I tried to take an interest I was never really thinking about any of the things that were going on about me And I was always thinking of the same thing Day and night the same thing If my mother sent me into the garden to see whether the autumn crocuses were up all I could see was his face It came up everywhere I looked I grew impatient of the companionship I had most loved I was thankful when Hermione had carried off my sister for the afternoon I felt Lord Helmstone had done me a personal kindness when he dropped in on the way to or from the golf links to talk to my mother I would slip away just for ten minutes to think about him in peace When I went in I would find I had been gone for hours The old laws of Time and Space seemed all at sixes and sevens The old devotions paled Mercifully nobody knew I looked for him all the next spring In the[Pg ] summer I said to myself I shall never see him again Then a day in September when he came Came not only to Big Klaus s and the Links He came to Duncombe the very first evening to ask about my mother I heard his voice at the door It seemed to come up from the roots of the world to knock against my heart I stood by the banisters out of sight and listened while I held the banisters hard No he wouldn t come in now He would come to morrow I flew to the window in the morning room and looked out I had not dreamed him He was true The next day brought him I had all those hours to get myself in hand I was quite quiet The others seemed gladder to see him than I He was pleased at finding my mother so well The crowning proof of her being stronger was her doing a quite unprecedented thing She invited Mr Annan to come and have tea at Duncombe [Pg ] instead of tramping all that distance back to the Farm Big Klaus s tea she was sure was worse even than the Club House brew The result was that he fell into the habit of playing another round after tea which my mother said was good for him She agreed with Lord Helmstone that Mr Annan should not work when he had come away for a holiday The Helmstones were for ever asking him to lunch and dine But he always said that sort of thing took up too much time So we felt flattered when instead of playing the other round he would sit there in the garden after tea smoking a pipe and talking to us Bettina said our home made cakes and delicious Duncombe tea were quite wasted on him I was secretly indignant at the charge But Bettina made him confess he could not tell Indian from China Very well then I said it proves he doesn t come only for tea and upon that a fire seemed to play all round my body scorching me But no one noticed It was wonderful to see him again to verify all those things I had been thinking about him for[Pg ] the year and four months since he went away But if I were told even now to describe Eric Annan I would say at once that he was a person whose special quality escaped from any net of words that sought to catch it If at the time I speak of I had been compelled to make the attempt I should have taken refuge in such commonplaces as strongly built colouring between dark and fair a wholesome kind of mouth with good teeth brown eyes not large with reddish flecks in the iris And I might have added one thing more uncommon That gift of his for saying nothing at all without embarrassment I thought of him as a person standing alone I could not imagine him in the usual relationships The others must have felt like that about him too for I remember they were surprised when Lord Helmstone told us that Eric Annan was one of the large family of an impoverished Scots laird Bettina said to him the next day I don t suppose you have any sisters He looked surprised and I expected him to repudiate such trifles But he said Yes Three in a tone that dismissed them But the confession seemed to have brought him[Pg ] nearer to make him more human He had been a little boy then playing with little girls He had grown up not only with students and professors but with sisters Oh happy sisters how they must adore him I asked him to tell us about them were the sisters like him No What were they like Oh he looked vague Then he presented a testimonial They were all right The proof two of them were married And the third Oh the third was only twenty I felt a special interest in that one But all we could learn was that she was engaged So she was probably all right too My mother was the best at making him talk She discovered that he was like so many of the silent seeming people fluent enough when he liked Though he never was fluent about his sisters when he came to know us better he told my mother about his elder brother struggling still to keep up the property a losing battle And a second brother not very clever intended for the navy He hadn t got on He left the navy and had some small post in the Customs The third brother was trying to grow tea in Ceylon [Pg ] Bettina hoped the third brother was more intelligent about tea than our friend Eric was the fourth son To get a scientific education on any terms had been a struggle He had to arrive at it obliquely by way of studying medicine Pure science didn t pay But science was the one thing on earth worth a man s giving his life to I see him sitting in the level light on Duncombe lawn looking up in that sudden way of his and narrowing his eyes at the sunset bringing out the word research with a tenacity of insistence on the r which must make even a Natural Law feel the hopelessness of hiding any longer That preliminary to setting aside his earlier reserve a forefinger sweeping upward and outward through the red brown thatch on his upper lip and then telling my mother about those hours of fathoms deep absorption of the ray of light that from time to time would pierce the darkness He told her with something very like emotion of the great still gladness that
