The week we spent going up the Colorado in June was not as uncomfortable as the time spent on the river in August of the previous year Everything is relative I discovered and I was happy in going back to stay with the First Lieutenant of C Company and share his fortunes awhile longer Patrocina recovered as soon as she found we were to return to Ehrenberg I wondered how anybody could be so homesick for such a God forsaken place I asked her if she had ever seen a tree or green grass for I could talk with her quite easily now She shook her mournful head But don t you want to see trees and grass and flowers Another sad shake of the head was the only reply Such people such natures and such lives were incomprehensible to me then I could not look at things except from my own standpoint She took her child upon her knee and lighted a cigarette I took mine upon my knee and gazed at the river banks they were now old friends I had gazed at them many times before how much I had experienced and how much had happened since I first saw them Could it be that I should ever come to love them and the pungent smell of the arrow weed which covered them to the water s edge The huge mosquitoes swarmed over us in the nights from those thick clumps of arrow weed and willow and the nets with which Captain Mellon provided us did not afford much protection The June heat was bad enough though not quite so stifling as the August heat I was becoming accustomed to climates and had learned to endure discomfort The salt beef and the Chinaman s peach pies were no longer offensive to me Indeed I had a good appetite for them though they were not exactly the sort of food prescribed by the modern doctor for a young mother Of course milk eggs and all fresh food were not to be had on the river boats Ice was still a thing unknown on the Colorado When after a week the Gila pushed her nose up to the bank at Ehrenberg there stood the Quartermaster He jumped aboard and did not seem in the least surprised to see me I knew you d come back said he I laughed of course and we both laughed I hadn t the courage to go on I replied Oh well we can make things comfortable here and get through the summer some way he said I ll build some rooms on and a kitchen and we can surely get along It s the healthiest place in the world for children they tell me So after a hearty handshake with Captain Mellon who had taken such good care of me on my week s voyage up river I being almost the only passenger I put my foot once more on the shores of old Ehrenberg and we wended our way towards the blank white walls of the Government house I was glad to be back and content to wait So work was begun immediately on the kitchen My first stipulation was that the new rooms were to have wooden floors for although the Cocopah Charley kept the adobe floors in perfect condition by sprinkling them down and sweeping them out every morning they were quite impossible especially where it concerned white dresses and children and the little sharp rocks in them seemed to be so tiring to the feet Life as we Americans live it was difficult in Ehrenberg I often said Oh if we could only live as the Mexicans live how easy it would be For they had their fire built between some stones piled up in their yard a piece of sheet iron laid over the top this was the cooking stove A pot of coffee was made in the morning early and the family sat on the low porch and drank it and ate a biscuit Then a kettle of frijoles [ ] was put over to boil These were boiled slowly for some hours then lard and salt were added and they simmered down until they were deliciously fit to eat and had a thick red gravy Mexican brown bean Then the young matron or daughter of the house would mix the peculiar paste of flour and salt and water for tortillas a species of unleavened bread These tortillas were patted out until they were as large as a dinner plate and very thin then thrown onto the hot sheet iron where they baked Each one of the family then got a tortilla the spoonful of beans was laid upon it and so they managed without the paraphernalia of silver and china and napery How I envied them the simplicity of their lives Besides the tortillas were delicious to eat and as for the frijoles they were beyond anything I had ever eaten in the shape of beans I took lessons in the making of tortillas A woman was paid to come and teach me but I never mastered the art It is in the blood of the Mexican and a girl begins at a very early age to make the tortilla It is the most graceful thing to see a pretty Mexican toss the wafer like disc over her bare arm and pat it out until transparent This was their supper for like nearly all people in the tropics they ate only twice a day Their fare was varied sometimes by a little carni seca pounded up and stewed with chile verde or chile colorado Now if you could hear the soft exquisite affectionate drawl with which the Mexican woman says chile verde you could perhaps come to realize what an important part the delicious green pepper plays in the cookery of these countries They do not use it in its raw state but generally roast it whole stripping off the thin skin and throwing away the seeds leaving only the pulp which acquires a fine flavor by having been roasted or toasted over the hot coals The women were scrupulously clean and modest and always wore when in their casa a low necked and short sleeved white linen camisa fitting neatly with bands around neck and arms Over this they wore a calico skirt always white stockings and black slippers When they ventured out the younger women put on muslin gowns and carried parasols The older women wore a linen towel thrown over their heads or in cool weather the black riboso I often cried Oh if I could only dress as the Mexicans do Their necks and arms do look so cool and clean I have always been sorry I did not adopt their fashion of house apparel Instead of that I yielded to the prejudices of my conservative partner and sweltered during the day in high necked and long sleeved white dresses kept up the table in American fashion ate American food in so far as we could get it and all at the expense of strength for our soldier cooks who were loaned us by Captain Ernest from his company at Fort Yuma were constantly being changed and I was often left with the Indian and the indolent Patrocina At those times how I wished I had no silver no table linen no china and could revert to the primitive customs of my neighbors There was no market but occasionally a Mexican killed a steer and we bought enough for one meal but having no ice and no place away from the terrific heat the meat was hung out under the ramada with a piece of netting over it until the first heat had passed out of it and then it was cooked The Mexican after selling what meat he could cut the rest into thin strips and hung it up on ropes to dry in the sun It dried hard and brittle in its natural state so pure is the air on that wonderful river bank They called this carni seca and the Americans called it jerked beef Patrocina often prepared me a dish of this when I was unable to taste the fresh meat She would pound it fine with a heavy pestle and then put it to simmer seasoning it with the green or red pepper It was most savory There was no butter at all during the hot months but our hens laid a few eggs and the Quartermaster was allowed to keep a small lot of commissary stores from which we drew our supplies of flour ham and canned things We were often without milk for weeks at a time for the cows crossed the river to graze and sometimes could not get back until the river fell again and they could pick their way back across the shifting sand bars The Indian brought the water every morning in buckets from the river It looked like melted chocolate He filled the barrels and when it had settled clear the ollas were filled and thus the drinking water was a trifle cooler than the air One day it seemed unusually cool so I said Let us see by the thermometer how cool the water really is We found the temperature of the water to be degrees but that with the air at in the shade seemed quite refreshing to drink I did not see any white people at all except Fisher Abe Frank the mail contractor and one or two of the younger merchants If I wanted anything I went to Fisher He always could solve the difficulty He procured for me an excellent middle aged laundress who came and brought the linen herself and bowing to the floor said always Buenos dias Senorita dwelling on the latter word as a gentle compliment to a younger woman and then Mucho calor este dia in her low drawling voice Like the others she was spotlessly clean modest and gentle I asked her what on earth they did about bathing for I had found the tub baths with the muddy water so disagreeable She told me the women bathed in the river at daybreak and asked me if I would like to go with them I was only too glad to avail myself of her invitation and so like Pharoah s daughter of old I went with my gentle handmaiden every morning to the river bank and wading in about knee deep in the thick red waters we sat down and let the swift current flow by us We dared not go deeper we could feel the round stones grinding against each other as they were carried down and we were all afraid It was difficult to keep one s foothold and Capt Mellon s words were ever ringing in my ears He who disappears below the surface of the Colorado is never seen again But we joined hands and ventured like children and played like children in these red waters and after all it was much nicer than a tub of muddy water indoors A clump of low mesquite trees at the top of the bank afforded sufficient protection at that hour we rubbed dry slipped on a loose gown and wended our way home What a contrast to the limpid bracing salt waters of my own beloved shores When I thought of them I was seized with a longing which consumed me and made my heart sick and I thought of these poor people who had never known anything in their lives but those desert places and that muddy red water and wondered what they would do how they would act if transported into some beautiful forest or to the cool bright shores where clear blue waters invite to a plunge Whenever the river boat came up we were sure to have guests for many officers went into the Territory via Ehrenberg Sometimes the transportation was awaiting them at other times they were obliged to wait at Ehrenberg until it arrived They usually lived on the boat as we had no extra rooms but I generally asked them to luncheon or supper for anything that could be called a dinner was out of the question This caused me some anxiety as there was nothing to be had but I remembered the hospitality I had received and thought of what they had been obliged to eat on the voyage and I always asked them to share what we could provide however simple it might be At such times we heard all the news from Washington and the States and all about the fashions and they in their turn asked me all sorts of questions about Ehrenberg and how I managed to endure the life They were always astonished when the Cocopah Indian waited on them at table for he wore nothing but his gee string and although it was an every day matter to us it rather took their breath away But Charley appealed to my aesthetic sense in every way Tall and well made with clean cut limbs and features fine smooth copper colored skin handsome face heavy black hair done up in pompadour fashion and plastered with Colorado mud which was baked white by the sun a small feather at the crown of his head wide turquoise bead bracelets upon his upper arm and a knife at his waist this was my Charley my half tame Cocopah my man about the place my butler in fact for Charley understood how to open a bottle of Cocomonga gracefully and to keep the glasses filled Charley also wheeled the baby out along the river banks for we had had a fine perambulator sent down from San Francisco It was an incongruous sight to be sure and one must laugh to think of it The Ehrenberg babies did not have carriages and the village flocked to see it There sat the fair haired six months old boy with but one linen garment on no cap no stockings and this wild man of the desert his knife gleaming at his waist and his gee string floating out behind wheeling and pushing the carriage along the sandy roads But this came to an end for one day Fisher rushed in breathless and said Well here is your baby I was just in time for that Injun of yours left the carriage in the middle of the street to look in at the store window and a herd of wild cattle came tearing down I grabbed the carriage to the sidewalk cussed the Injun out and here s the child It s no use he added you can t trust those Injuns out of sight The heat was terrific Our cots were placed in the open part of the corral as our courtyard was always called It was a desolate looking place on one side the high adobe wall on another the freight house and on the other two our apartments Our kitchen and the two other rooms were now completed The kitchen had no windows only open spaces to admit the air and light and we were often startled in the night by the noise of thieves in the house rummaging for food At such times our soldier cook would rush into the corral with his rifle the Lieutenant would jump up and seize his shotgun which always stood near by and together they would roam through the house But the thieving Indians could jump out of the windows as easily as they jumped in and the excitement would soon be over The violent sand storms which prevail in those deserts sometimes came up in the night without warning then we rushed half suffocated and blinded into the house and as soon as we had closed the windows it had passed on leaving a deep layer of sand on everything in the room and on our perspiring bodies Then came the work next day for the Indian had to carry everything out of doors and one storm was so bad that he had to use a shovel to remove the sand from the floors The desert literally blew into the house And now we saw a singular phenomenon In the late afternoon of each day a hot steam would collect over the face of the river then slowly rise and floating over the length and breadth of this wretched hamlet of Ehrenberg descend upon and envelop us Thus we wilted and perspired and had one part of the vapor bath without its bracing concomitant of the cool shower In a half hour it was gone but always left me prostrate then Jack gave me milk punch if milk was at hand or sherry and egg or something to bring me up to normal again We got to dread the steam so it was the climax of the long hot day and was peculiar to that part of the river The paraphernalia by the side of our cots at night consisted of a pitcher of cold tea a lantern matches a revolver and a shotgun Enormous yellow cats which lived in and around the freight house darted to and fro inside and outside the house along the ceiling beams emitting loud cries and that alone was enough to prevent sleep In the old part of the house some of the partitions did not run up to the roof but were left open for ventilation I suppose thus making a fine play ground for cats and rats which darted along squeaking meowing and clattering all the night through An uncanny feeling of insecurity was ever with me What with the accumulated effect of the day s heat what with the thieving Indians the sand storms and the cats our nights by no means gave us the refreshment needed by our worn out systems By the latter part of the summer I was so exhausted by the heat and the various difficulties of living that I had become a mere shadow of my former self Men and children seem to thrive in those climates but it is death to women as I had often heard It was in the late summer that the boat arrived one day bringing a large number of staff officers and their wives head clerks and general service men for Fort Whipple They had all been stationed in Washington for a number of years having had what is known in the army as gilt edged details I threw a linen towel over my head and went to the boat to call on them and remembering my voyage from San Francisco the year before prepared to sympathize with them But they had met their fate with resignation knowing they should find a good climate and a pleasant post up in the mountains and as they had no young children with them they were disposed to make merry over their discomforts We asked them to come to our quarters for supper and to come early as any place was cooler than the boat lying down there in the melting sun and nothing to look upon but those hot zinc covered decks or the ragged river banks with their uninviting huts scattered along the edge The surroundings somehow did not fit these people Now Mrs Montgomery at Camp Apache seemed to have adapted herself to the rude setting of a log cabin in the mountains but these were Staff people and they had enjoyed for years the civilized side of army life now they were determined to rough it but they did not know how to begin The beautiful wife of the Adjutant General was mourning over some freckles which had come to adorn her dazzling complexion and she had put on a large hat with a veil Was there ever anything so incongruous as a hat and veil in Ehrenberg For a long time I had not seen a woman in a hat the Mexicans all wore a linen towel over their heads But her beauty was startling and after all I thought a woman so handsome must try to live up to her reputation Now for some weeks Jack had been investigating the sulphur well which was beneath the old pump in our corral He had had a long wooden bath tub built and I watched it with a lazy interest and observed his glee as he found a longshoreman or roustabout who could caulk it The shape was exactly like a coffin but men have no imaginations and when I told him how it made me feel to look at it he said Oh you are always thinking of gloomy things It s a fine tub and we are mighty lucky to find that man to caulk it I m going to set it up in the little square room and lead the sulphur water into it and it will be splendid and just think he added what it will do for rheumatism Now Jack had served in the Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers during the Civil War and the swamps of the Chickahominy had brought him into close acquaintance with that dread disease As for myself rheumatism was about the only ailment I did not have at that time and I suppose I did not really sympathize with him But this energetic and indomitable man mended the pump with Fisher s help and led the water into the house laid a floor set up the tub in the little square room and behold our sulphur bath After much persuasion I tried the bath The water flowed thick and inky black into the tub of course the odor was beyond description and the effect upon me was not such that I was ever willing to try it again Jack beamed How do you like it Martha said he Isn t it fine Why people travel hundreds of miles to get a bath like that I had my own opinion but I did not wish to dampen his enthusiasm Still in order to protect myself in the future I had to tell him I thought I should ordinarily prefer the river Well he said there are those who will be thankful to have a bath in that water I am going to use it every day I remonstrated How do you know what is in that inky water and how do you dare to use it Oh Fisher says it s all right people here used to drink it years ago but they have not done so lately because the pump was broken down The Washington people seemed glad to pay us the visit Jack s eyes danced with true generosity and glee He marked his victim and selecting the Staff beauty and the Paymaster s wife he expatiated on the wonderful properties of his sulphur bath Why yes the sooner the better said Mrs Martin I d give everything I have in this world and all my chances for the next to get a tub bath It will be so refreshing just before supper said Mrs Maynadier who was more conservative So the Indian who had put on his dark blue waist band or sash made from flannel revelled out and twisted into strands of yarn and which showed the supple muscles of his clean cut thighs and who had done up an extra high pompadour in white clay and burnished his knife which gleamed at his waist ushered these Washington women into a small apartment adjoining the bath room and turned on the inky stream into the sarcophagus The Staff beauty looked at the black pool and shuddered Do you use it said she Occasionally I equivocated Does it hurt the complexion she ventured Jack thinks it excellent for that I replied And then I left them directing Charley to wait and prepare the bath for the second victim By and by the beauty came out Where is your mirror cried she for our appointments were primitive and mirrors did not grow on bushes at Ehrenberg I fancy I look queer she added and in truth she did for our water of the Styx did not seem to affiliate with the chemical properties of the numerous cosmetics used by her more or less all her life but especially on the voyage and her face had taken on a queer color with peculiar spots here and there Fortunately my mirrors were neither large nor true and she never really saw how she looked but when she came back into the living room she laughed and said to Jack What kind of water did you say that was I never saw any just like it Oh you have probably never been much to the sulphur springs said he with his most superior and crushing manner Perhaps not she replied but I thought I knew something about it why my entire body turned such a queer color Oh it always does that said this optimistic soldier man and that shows it is doing good The Paymaster s wife joined us later I think she had profited by the beauty s experience for she said but little The Quartermaster was happy and what if his wife did not believe in that uncanny stream which flowed somewhere from out the infernal regions underlying that wretched hamlet he had succeeded in being a benefactor to two travellers at least We had a merry supper cold ham chicken and fresh biscuit a plenty of good Cocomonga wine sweet milk which to be sure turned to curds as it stood on the table some sort of preserves from a tin and good coffee I gave them the best to be had in the desert and at all events it was a change from the Chinaman s salt beef and peach pies and they saw fresh table linen and shining silver and accepted our simple hospitality in the spirit in which we gave it Alice Martin was much amused over Charley and Charley could do nothing but gaze on her lovely features Why on earth don t you put some clothes on him laughed she in her delightful way I explained to her that the Indian s fashion of wearing white men s clothes was not pleasing to the eye and told her that she must cultivate her aesthetic sense and in a short time she would be able to admire these copper colored creatures of Nature as much as I did But I fear that a life spent mostly in a large city had cast fetters around her imagination and that the life at Fort Whipple afterwards savored too much of civilization to loosen the bonds of her soul I saw her many times again but she never recovered from her amazement at
