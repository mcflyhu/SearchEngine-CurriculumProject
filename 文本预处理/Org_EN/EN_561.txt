The night was falling when Buford left He and Dominick had sat on in the den talking together in low voices going over past events in the concatenation of circumstances that had led up to the extraordinary situation in which they now found themselves Both listened with strained ears for the opening of Bernice s door but not a sound came from her room Each silently without expressing his thoughts to the other wondered what she would do what sensational move might now be expected of her While they talked it was evident she intended to make no sign of life After Buford had left Dominick called up his friend on the telephone telling him that he would be unable to meet him at dinner He knew that Berny could hear every word he uttered and with indescribable dread he expected that she would open her door and accost him But again she preserved an inviolate invisibility though beneath her portal he could see a crack of light and could hear her moving about in the room [ ]He went into his own room lit the gas and began packing his trunks He was dazed and stupefied by what had occurred and almost the only clearly defined idea he had was to leave the house and get far from the presence of the woman who had so ruthlessly poisoned his life He was in the midst of his packing when the Chinaman summoned him to dinner but he told the man he cared for nothing and would want no breakfast on the following morning The servant who by this time was well aware that the household was a strange one shrugged his shoulders without comment and passed on to the door of his mistress room upon which he knocked with the low deferential rap of the Chinese domestic Berny s voice sounded shrilly through the silence of the flat Go away Let me alone If that s dinner I don t want any The sound of her voice pierced Dominick with a sense of loathing and horror He stopped in his packing suddenly deciding to leave everything and go go from the house and from her as soon as he could get away He thrust into a valise such articles as he would want for the night and set the bag by the stair head while he went into the parlor to find some bills and letters of his that he remembered to have left in the desk As he passed Berny s door it flew open and she appeared in the aperture The room[ ] behind her was a blaze of light every gas jet lit and pouring a flood of radiance over the clothes outspread on the bed the chairs and the floor She herself in a lace trimmed petticoat and loose silk dressing sack stood in the doorway staring at Dominick her face pinched white and fierce What are you doing she said abruptly Going away Yes he answered stopping at the sight of the dreaded apparition That s my intention Where are you going she demanded He gave her a cold look and made no answer Are you going to your mother s she cried He moved forward toward the parlor door and she came out into the passage looking after him and repeating with a tremulous hoarse persistence Dominick answer me Are you going to your mother s Yes I am he said over his shoulder He had an unutterable dread that she would begin to speak of the situation of Buford of her past life that she would try to explain and exonerate herself and they would be plunged into a long and profitless discussion of all the sickening irremediable wretchedness of the past He could not bear the thought of it he would have done anything to avoid it He wanted to escape from her from the house where she had tortured him where he seemed to have laid down his manhood his honor his faith and seen her[ ] trample on them The natural supposition that he would want to confront her with her deception and hear her explanation was the last thing he desired doing Don t go to your mother s she cried following him up the hall for to night Dominick please And don t tell her I beg I pray of you don t tell her till to morrow Her manner was so pleadingly so imploringly insistent that he turned and looked somberly at her She was evidently deeply in earnest her face lined with anxiety This is the last thing I ll ever ask of you I know I ve got no right to ask anything but you re generous you ve been kind to me in the past and it ll not cost you much to be kind just once again Go to a hotel or the club or anywhere you like but not to your mother s and don t tell her till to morrow afternoon He stared at her without speaking wishing she would be silent and leave him I ll not trouble you after to morrow I ll go I ll get out You ll never be bothered by me any more All right he said I ll go to the club Let me alone that s all and let me go And and she persisted you won t tell her till to morrow to morrow afternoon He had entered the parlor in which the Chinaman had lit the lamps and opening the desk[ ] began hunting for his papers To her last words he returned no answer and she crept in after him and stood in the doorway leaning against the woodwork of the door frame You won t tell her till to morrow to morrow say after three He found the letters and drew them out of their pigeonhole All right he almost shouted I won t tell her But for God s sake leave me alone and let me go If you keep on following me round this way I won t answer for what I ll do You promise then she said ignoring his heat You promise you ll not tell her till after three He turned from the desk gave her a look of restrained passion and said I promise then passed by her as she stood in the doorway and walked to the stair head Here his valise stood and snatching it up he ran down the stairs and out of the house Bernice hearing the door shut returned to her room and went on with the work of sorting her wardrobe and packing her trunks She did it deliberately and carefully looking over each garment and folding the choicer articles between sheets of tissue paper At midnight she had not yet finished and under the blaze of the gases looking very tired she went on smoothing skirts and pinching up the lace on bodices as she laid[ ] them tenderly on the trays that stood on the bed the table and the sofa The night was far spent before everything was arranged to her satisfaction and she went to bed She was up betimes in the morning Eight o clock had not struck when she was making a last tour of the parlor picking up small articles of silver and glass that she crowded down into cracks in the tightly packed trunks At breakfast the Chinaman an oblique observant eye on her asked her what he should prepare for lunch Conscious that if she told him she would not be back he might become alarmed at the general desertion and demand his wages she ordered an even more elaborate menu than usual telling him she would bring home a friend She breakfasted in her wrapper and after the meal finished her toilet with the extremest solicitude Never had she taken more pains with herself Though anxiety and strain had thinned and sharpened her the fever of excitement which burnt in her temporarily repaired these ravages Her eyes were brilliant without artificial aid her cheeks a hot dry crimson that needed no rouge The innate practicality of her character asserted itself even in this harassed hour Last night she had put the purple orchid in a glass of water on the bureau Now as she pinned it on her breast she congratulated herself for her foresight the pale lavender petals of the rare blossom toning[ ] altogether harmoniously with her dress of dark purple cloth Before she left the room she locked the trunks and left beside them a dress suit case packed for a journey Standing in the doorway she took a hurried look about the apartment a last farewell survey not of sentiment but of investigation to see if she had forgotten anything A silver photograph frame set in rhinestones caught her eye and she went back and took it up weighing it uncertainly in her hand Some of the rhinestones had fallen out and she finally decided it was not worth while opening the trunks to put in such a damaged article It was only a quarter past nine when she emerged from the flat She took the down town car and twenty minutes later was mounting the steps to Bill Cannon s office She had been motionless and rigidly preoccupied on the car but as she approached the office a change was visible in her gait and mien She moved with a light perky assurance a motion as of a delicate triumphant buoyancy seeming to impart itself to her whole body from her shoulders to her feet A slight mild smile settled on her lips suggesting gaiety tempered with good humor Her eye was charged with the same expression rendered more piquant by a gleam the merest suggestion of coquettish challenge The Bonanza King was already in his office [ ] The same obsequious clerk who had shown her in on a former occasion took her card in to the inner sanctum where the great man even at this early hour was shut away with the business which occupied his crowded days In a moment the young man returned smiling and quite as murmurously polite as he had been on her former visit and Berny was once again ushered into the presence of the enemy The old man had read the name on the card with a lowering glance His command to admit the visitor had been hardly more than an inarticulate growl which the well trained clerk understood as those about deaf mutes can read their half made signs Cannon was not entirely surprised at her reappearance and mingled feelings stirred in him as he turned his swivel chair away from the table and sat hunched in it his elbows on its arms his hands clasped over his stomach She came in with an effect of dash confidence and brilliancy that astonished him He had expected her almost to sidle in in obvious guilty fear of him her resistance broken humbly coming to sue for the money Instead a rustling scented apparition appeared in the doorway more gracious handsome and smiling than he had ever thought she could be She stood for a moment as if waiting for his invitation to enter the whole effect of her rich costume her feverishly high coloring and her debonair and self confident[ ] demeanor surprising him into silence A long white feather on her hat made a background for her darkly flushed face and auburn hair There were some amethysts round her neck their purple lights harmonizing richly with the superb flower pinned on her breast Her eyes looked very black laughing and provocative through her spotted veil Well she said in a gay voice here I am again Is it a surprise She advanced into the room and the old man almost unconsciously rose from his chair Yes sort of he said dryly She stopped by the desk looked at him sidewise and said Do we shake hands His glance on her was hard and cold Berny met it and could not restrain a sinking of the courage that was her most admirable characteristic and that she had screwed far past its ordinary sticking point that morning She sank down into the same arm chair that she had occupied on her former visit and said with a little languid effect of indifference Oh well never mind We don t have to waste time being polite That s one of the most convenient things about our interviews We just say what we really think and there s no need bothering about humbug So glad to hear it said the old man with[ ] his most ironical air Suppose then you let me know what you ve come down to say Can t you guess she answered with an expression that was almost one of flirtatious interrogation Nup he answered looking steadily at her I have to have it said in that plain style with no politeness that you say is the way we always talk All right she answered briskly Here it is as plain as A B C I ve decided to accept your offer and take the money She looked up at him smiling gallantly But as her eye caught his her smile try as she would to keep it died He suddenly realized that she was extremely nervous that her lips were dry and the hand she put up to adjust her veil and thus hide her intractable mouth was shaking The admiration he had of late felt for her insolent fearlessness increased also he began to feel that now at last he was rising to the position of master of the situation He leaned back in the swivel chair and glowered at her You know he said slowly you ve a gall that beats anything I ve ever seen Two days ago you busted this business higher than a kite by stopping my daughter on the public street and telling her the whole story You did the one thing you knew I d never forgive and you ended the affair hammered the nails in its coffin and buried it Now you come flourishing into my[ ] office as if nothing had happened and say you ll take the money It beats me how you ve got the nerve to dare to show your face in here Berny listened with the hand holding the veil pressed against her mouth and her eyes staring over it It s all straight enough she burst out what you say about telling your daughter I did it and I was crazy I ll admit that But you ll have to admit on your side that it was pretty rough the way I was treated here ordered out like a peddler I was sore and it was you that made me so And I ll not deny that I wanted to hit you back But you brought it on yourself And anyway what does it matter if I go Maybe your daughter s mad and disgusted now but women don t stay that way for ever If I get out drop out of sight the way I intend to do give Dominick his freedom isn t she going to forget all about what I said Wouldn t any woman The Bonanza King made no answer He had no intention of talking with this objectionable woman about his daughter But in his heart hope sprang at the words They were an echo of his own desires and opinions If this woman took the money and went would not Rose in the course of time relent in her attitude of iron disapproval and smile on the man she loved Could any woman hold out for ever in such a position [ ] See here Berny went on I ll leave a statement I ll put it in your hands that I changed my mind and voluntarily left I ll draw it up before a notary if you want And it s true She needn t think that I m being forced out to make a place for her I m glad to go She had leaned nearer to him from the chair one finger tapping the corner of the desk to emphasize her words Scrutinizing her as she spoke he became more than ever impressed with the conviction that she was held in a tremor of febrile excitement Her voice had an under note of vibration in it like the voice of one who breathes quickly The orchid on her breast trembled with the trembling of her frame Look here he said quietly I want to understand this thing What s made you change your mind so suddenly A few days ago you were all up on fiddle strings at the suggestion of taking that money Here this morning in you pop and you re all of a tremble to get it What s the meaning of it I can t stand it any more she said When you said I couldn t the other day that I d break down you were right I can t stand it Nobody could It s broken me to pieces I want to get away from it all I want to go somewhere where I m at peace where the people don t hate me and hound me Her voice suddenly grew hoarse and she[ ] stopped He looked at her in surprise She bent her face down biting her under lip and picked tremulously at the leaves of the purple orchid as if arranging them You ve beaten me she said in a suddenly strangled voice you ve beaten me I can t fight any longer Give me some money and let me go I m beaten She lowered her head still farther and burst into tears So unexpected were they that she had no preparations for them Her handkerchief was in the bead purse that hung on her wrist and blinded by tears she could not find the clasp Her fumbling hand tried for a possible reserve supply in her belt and then in despair went up to her face and lifted her veil trying to brush away the falling drops The Bonanza King stared at her amazed as much surprised as if he had seen a man weep Finally he felt in his own pocket produced a crisply laundered square of white linen and handed it to her observing soothingly Here take mine You re all broke up aren t you She seized his offering and mopped her cheeks with it sniffing and gasping while he watched her in genuine solicitude What s wore you down to this state he said You re the nerviest woman I ever saw [ ] It s it s all this thing she answered in a stifled voice I m just worn out I haven t slept for nights a memory of those miserable nights of perturbation and uncertainty swept over her and submerged her in a wave of self pity The tears gushed out again and she held the old man s large handkerchief against her eyes uttering small sobbing noises sunk in abandoned despondence in the hollow of the chair The Bonanza King was moved The facile tears of women did not affect him but the tears of this bold hard unbreakable creature whom he had regarded only as an antagonist to be vanquished stirred him to a sort of abashed sympathy There was something singularly pathetic about the completeness of her breakdown She who had been so audacious an adversary now in all her crumpled finery weeping into his handkerchief was so entirely and utterly a feeble crushable thing Come brace up he said cheeringly We can t do any talking while you re acting this way What s the proposition again I want some money and I want to go She raised her head and lowered the handkerchief speaking with a strained throaty insistence like a child I can t live here any more I can t bear it It would give a prize fighter nervous prostration I can t bear it Her voice grew small and high Really I can t she managed[ ] to articulate and then dissolved into another flood The old man high in his swivel chair sat with his hands in his pockets his lips pursed and his eyes on the floor Once or twice he whirled the chair slightly from one side to the other After a pause of some minutes he said Are you prepared to agree to everything Mrs Ryan and I demanded After the last outbreak she had completely abandoned herself to the hysterical condition that was beyond her control Now she made an effort to recover herself sat up swallowing and gasping while she wiped her eyes I m ready to do it all she sniffed only only she paused on the verge of another collapse suppressed it and said with some show of returning animation only I must have some money now a guarantee Oh he said with the descending note of comprehension As I remember we agreed to pay you seven thousand dollars for the first year the year of desertion She lowered the handkerchief entirely presenting to him a disfigured face all its good looks gone but showing distinct signs of attention I don t want the seven thousand I ll waive it I want a sum down a guarantee an advance You offered me at first fifty thousand dollars Give me that down and I ll go this afternoon [ ] That wasn t our original arrangement he said to gain time Deduct it from the rest I must have it I can t go without it If you give me the check now I ll leave for New York to night Her reviving interest and force seemed to have quenched the sources of her tears as suddenly as her exhausted nerves had made them flow But her disfigured face her figure which seemed to have shrunken in its fine clothes were extremely pathetic If you don t trust me send one of your clerks with me to buy my ticket send one to see me off I ve left my husband for good for ever I can t live here any longer Give me the money and let me go I don t see that I m going to have any security that you re going to carry out the whole plan How do I know that you re not going to New York to have a good time and then when you ve spent the money come back here She sat up and sent a despairing look about the room as if in a wild search for something that would convince him of her sincerity I swear I promise she cried with almost frantic emphasis that I ll never come back I m going for good and I m going to set Dominick free Oh do believe me Please I m telling the truth He was impressed by her manner as he had[ ] been by her tears Something undoubtedly had happened which had suddenly caused her to change her mind and decide to leave her husband He did not think that it was what she had told him Her excitement her overwrought condition suggested a cause less gradual more like a shock He ran over in his mind the advantages of giving her the money Nothing would be jeopardized by it It would simply be an advance made on the sum they had agreed upon Fifty thousand s too much he said slowly But I ll be square to you and I ll split the difference and give you twenty five I ll give you the check now and you can take it and go to night She shook her head obstinately It won t do she said What difference does it make to you whether you give it to me now or next year I ll give you a receipt for it There won t be any trouble about it It s as broad as it s long It s simply an advance on the main sum He looked moodily at her and then down Her demand seemed reasonable enough but he distrusted her If you don t believe me she insisted send out that clerk of yours to buy my ticket to New York Tell him to go up to the flat and he ll see my trunks all packed and ready I tell you you ve beaten me You and Mrs Ryan are one too many for me [ ]He again looked at her his lips pressed together his eye coldly considering I ll give you thirty thousand dollars and it s understood that you re to leave the city to night She demurred but with less show of vigor and for a space they haggled over the sum till they finally agreed upon thirty five thousand dollars As the old man drew the check she watched him with avid eagerness restraining by force the hand that trembled in its anxiety to become possessed of the slip of paper He noticed as she bent over the desk to sign the receipt that her fingers shook so they could hardly direct the pen She remarked it herself setting it down to her upset nerves and laughing at the sprawling signature With the check in her hand she rose something of the airy buoyancy of demeanor that had marked her on her entrance returning to her Well she said opening her purse this is the real beginning of our business relations I feel as if we were partners The old man gave a short dry laugh He could not rid his mind of suspicions of her and the whole proceeding though he did not see just how she could be deceiving him Wait till next year he said When I see the divorce papers I ll feel a lot surer of the partnership She snapped the clasp of her purse laughing[ ] and moving to the door She was wild to get away to escape from the dark room that held such unpleasant memories and the old man whose steely penetrating eye fastened on her was full of unsatisfied query Well so long she cried opening the door Next time we meet it will be more sociable I hope We really ought to be old friends by this time She hardly knew what she was saying but she laughed with a natural gaiety and in the doorway turned and bowed her jaunty good bys to him He stood back and nodded good humoredly at her his face showing puzzlement under its slight ironic smile Once in the street her demeanor again changed Her step became sharp and quick her expression keenly absorbed and concentrated A clock showed her that it was nearly half past ten and she walked with a speed that was as rapid a mode of progression as it could be without attracting attention to the great bank on which the check was drawn On the way down on the car she had thought out all her movements just what she would do and where she would go Her mind was as clear her movements as systematic as though she were moved by mechanism She ran up the steps to the bank and presented the check at the paying teller s window In one thousand dollar bills if you please [ ] she said trying not to speak breathlessly all but five hundred and you can give me that in one hundreds The man knew her made some vaguely polite remark and took the slip of paper back into unseen regions Berny stood waiting throbbing from head to foot with excitement She was not afraid they would refuse to cash the check Her sole fear was that Cannon as soon as she was gone might have regretted his action and telephoned from his office to stop the payment on it She knew that once the money was hers he would not make any attempt to get it back His own reputation and that of his daughter were too inextricably bound up with the transaction for him to dare to apprehend or punish Berny for her deception Her heart gave a wild leap as she saw the teller returning and then pause behind the netting of his golden cage while he counted out the bills She tried to speak lightly to him as he laid them one by one on the glass slab She was hardly conscious of what she said all she realized was that the crisp roll of paper in her fingers was her possession if not of great fortune at least of something to stand between her and the world When she left the bank she walked forward slowly the excitement which had carried her on to this point having suddenly left her feeling weak and tired She entered the railway office[ ] and bought her ticket for New York for that evening s train Then once more emerging into the sunshine she directed her steps to the car which would take her to her sisters She had decided to spend her last day in San Francisco with them As the car
