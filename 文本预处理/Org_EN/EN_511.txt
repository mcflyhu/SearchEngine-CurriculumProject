It is a misfortune to some fiction writers that fiction and unveracity in the average person s mind mean one and the same thing Several years ago I published a South Sea novel The action was placed in the Solomon Islands The action was praised by the critics and reviewers as a highly creditable effort of the imagination As regards reality they said there wasn t any Of course as every one knew kinky haired cannibals no longer obtained on the earth s surface much less ran around with nothing on chopping off one another s heads and on occasion a white man s head as well Now listen I am writing these lines in Honolulu Hawaii Yesterday on the beach at Waikiki a stranger spoke to me He mentioned a mutual friend Captain Kellar When I was wrecked in the Solomons on the blackbirder the Minota it was Captain Kellar master of the blackbirder the Eug nie who rescued me The blacks had taken Captain Kellar s head the stranger told me He knew He had represented Captain Kellar s mother in settling up the estate Listen I received a letter the other day from Mr C M Woodford Resident Commissioner of the British Solomons He was back at his post after a long furlough to England where he had entered his son into Oxford A search of the shelves of almost any public library will bring to light a book entitled A Naturalist Among the Head Hunters Mr C M Woodford is the naturalist He wrote the book To return to his letter In the course of the day s work he casually and briefly mentioned a particular job he had just got off his hands His absence in England had been the cause of delay The job had been to make a punitive expedition to a neighbouring island and incidentally to recover the heads of some mutual friends of ours a white trader his white wife and children and his white clerk The expedition was successful and Mr Woodford concluded his account of the episode with a statement to the effect What especially struck me was the absence of pain and terror in their faces which seemed to express rather serenity and repose this mind you of men and women of his own race whom he knew well and who had sat at dinner with him in his own house Other friends with whom I have sat at dinner in the brave rollicking days in the Solomons have since passed out by the same way My goodness I sailed in the teak built ketch the Minota on a blackbirding cruise to Malaita and I took my wife along The hatchet marks were still raw on the door of our tiny stateroom advertising an event of a few months before The event was the taking of Captain Mackenzie s head Captain Mackenzie at that time being master of the Minota As we sailed in to Langa Langa the British cruiser the Cambrian steamed out from the shelling of a village It is not expedient to burden this preliminary to my story with further details which I do make asseveration I possess a plenty I hope I have given some assurance that the adventures of my dog hero in this novel are real adventures in a very real cannibal world Bless you when I took my wife along on the cruise of the Minota we found on board a nigger chasing adorable Irish terrier puppy who was smooth coated like Jerry and whose name was Peggy Had it not been for Peggy this book would never have been written She was the chattel of the Minota s splendid skipper So much did Mrs London and I come to love her that Mrs London after the wreck of the Minota deliberately and shamelessly stole her from the Minota s skipper I do further admit that I did deliberately and shamelessly compound my wife s felony We loved Peggy so Dear royal glorious little dog buried at sea off the east coast of Australia I must add that Peggy like Jerry was born at Meringe Lagoon on Meringe Plantation which is of the Island of Ysabel said Ysabel Island lying next north of Florida Island where is the seat of government and where dwells the Resident Commissioner Mr C M Woodford Still further and finally I knew Peggy s mother and father well and have often known the warm
