The two young people remained alone looking at one another and feeling quite aghast at the position in which they now found themselves They had not expected Sir Joseph s appearance much less that he would behave in so brutal a manner Moreover he had repelled the hinted accusation so calmly and had admitted so freely that he had been in Walpole Lane that both Audrey and Ralph felt certain he was completely innocent Certainly they had not directly accused him of committing the crime the girl especially would have been horrified at the mere idea but Sir Joseph had taken what they said to mean that they suspected him and so had revenged himself in the cruel way he had done The bang of the door startled both from the momentary state of stupor into which the unexpected behaviour of Branwin had plunged them Audrey with a white face and startled eyes looked at her lover What is to be done now she asked in a low voice You must drive back home at once said Ralph determinedly She shook her head It is useless My father will go straight home and give orders that I am not to be admitted Oh that is impossible Think of the scandal Papa does not mind the scandal Already he has shown how far he is prepared to go by having me watched by Ranger Oh she clenched her hand think of the disgrace of it all Then you must stay the night at some hotel I cannot I have no baggage What hotel would take me in with no baggage I have very little money too and only the clothes I stand up in Oh the money doesn t matter my darling I can provide you with what you require said Ralph hastily then muttered through his teeth But it is a confoundedly awkward situation in any case Your father is a brute He is what he has always been said Audrey with a tired sigh for the late conversation had quite broken her up a man who has always had his own way There is only one thing to be done and she rose What is that asked Shawe hopefully I must go to the Pink Shop and throw myself on the mercy of my aunt Ralph brightened You clever darling to think of that he said looking at his watch It s half past ten o clock I wonder if she will be still up I daresay if not we can rouse her Come Ralph she pulled down her veil to hide a very white face let us go at once Oh I do hope that my father will say nothing of my being here to anyone I now see how rash I have been It s terrible Darling I really don t think your father will say anything for very shame he cannot He will account for your absence by saying that you refused to obey him with regard to this marriage with Anvers and that he turned you out Everyone who knows what an animal he is will believe this version I am quite sure that your visit here will never be known Thus comforted and seeing the commonsense view taken by Shawe Audrey went down the stairs with her lover and they passed out of the great block of buildings and through the Gardens The porter was not visible and as Audrey wore such a thick veil it was not likely that he would be able to recognise her on any future occasion In Fleet Street the barrister procured a cab and they drove westward in silence The whole thing seemed like a nightmare and Audrey shivered like a leaf It was terrible to think that she had no home If Madame Coralie refused to take her in Heaven only knew what she could do but she had every hope that her aunt would stand by her at this crisis particularly as she seemed to hate Sir Joseph Audrey darling I think we must get married said Ralph after a long silence things can t go on in this way But your career said Audrey faintly Never mind my career Your father has deserted you so you must become my wife in order that I may have the right to protect you Madame Coralie can keep you with her until we can arrange matters But if Mrs Mellop comes to hear of When you are my wife no one will dare to say a word said Ralph decidedly If anyone does he or she will have to reckon with me Besides as I told you before your father brutal as he is will not be such a fool as to soil the name of his own daughter Popularity is the breath of his nostrils and people would cry out on him if he talked of your visit to me Yes Audrey felt cheered when Ralph talked in this way I think you are right But I do hope my aunt will take me in From what you told me of the interview I think she will dear She seems to hate Sir Joseph in a very healthy manner Audrey I really don t know how you came to have such a father I don t believe that you are his daughter There must be some mistake I wish I were anyone else s daughter indeed said the girl sighing You will soon be my wife so that will settle everything said Ralph as the cab turned into Walpole Lane Here we are dearest There is a light in the upstairs window so Madame Coralie has not yet retired Having dismissed the cab Shawe rang the bell and shortly Badoura appeared to open the door and to look with astonishment at the pair Will you tell Madame Coralie that Miss Branwin wishes to see her said Shawe She is just returning from the theatre and we called in here on our way to Camden Hill As Audrey wore a long cloak over her dress Badoura could not see that she was in walking costume and quite believed the story Of course she knew who Shawe was since that young gentleman had accompanied Miss Branwin on the morning when the death of the poor woman had been discovered She therefore readily accepted the false explanation as a true one and invited the two into the shop while she went upstairs to Madame Coralie who was it appeared working late in the still room at some newly invented lotion In the perfumed and dimly lighted shop the lovers waited That girl does not suspect the truth you see whispered Ralph hurriedly Thanks to your clever explanation replied Audrey in the same low voice But what am I to say when I stay here all night Your aunt will invent an explanation Don t trouble Here she is Even as Shawe spoke the heavy footfall of the woman was heard and she came into the shop hurriedly Her eyes which were visible above the black silk of the yashmak looked startled and anxious although the rest of her face could not be seen Evidently and with very good reason she was alarmed by this late and unexpected visit Aunt Flora began Audrey and had only uttered the name when Madame Coralie pointed to Shawe with an alarmed gesture Oh that is all right went on the girl rapidly He knows all about it I told you that I would tell him don t you remember Yes said Madame Coralie in her harsh voice and peering at the young man anxiously I gave you permission to tell him But mind you hold your tongue Mr Shawe Then without waiting for a reply she turned to Audrey What is the matter that you come here at this hour My father has turned me out of the house Aunt Flora and I come to you for shelter said Audrey rapidly I have nowhere to go Madame Coralie clutched her yashmak and stamped her foot When she spoke her voice was almost inarticulate with rage Do you mean to say that Joseph has dared to turn you from your home at this hour Yes And Audrey assisted by Shawe rapidly related all that had taken place although they both suppressed for obvious reasons any account of the suspicions they entertained on the evidence of Parizade s keen sense of smell So you see ended the girl with a sob that unless you take me in I have no place to shelter my head My dear Madame Coralie made as though to catch her niece in her arms but checked herself abruptly Of course you shall stay here as long as you like But Badoura told me you had come from the theatre My excuse for this midnight visit said Ralph quickly and now Madame you must invent some reason for Audrey stopping here for the night Oh that is easy enough she stepped back and looked at the slender figure of the girl scarcely visible in the dim light you are too thin Miss Branwin and you wish me to treat you Will Badoura accept that excuse asked Audrey timidly Yes said Madame bluntly she will accept any excuse that I like to give her If she doesn t she loses her situation Don t trouble Miss Why don t you call me Audrey Aunt Flora Because I don t want the relationship known said the woman promptly it is just as well therefore that I should call you Miss Branwin But we can t stay talking here all night Go away Mr Shawe and don t come here again until I give you permission But I want to see Audrey You can do so when she walks in Kensington Gardens as usual replied Madame Coralie sharply but if you come here people will talk and the quieter this business is kept the better it will be for everyone But if papa talks began Audrey only to be cut short Papa won t talk said Madame Coralie in a hard dry voice He will have quite enough to occupy his mind in marrying Miss Rosy Pearl that is if he ever does marry the creature Madame Ralph started forward what do you mean Never mind go away at once Madame unlocked the door It is too late to chatter and Miss Branwin looks quite worn out Shawe admitted the truth of this speech and after a farewell embrace at which Madame Coralie looked benignly he took his leave When the door was once more closed Audrey followed her aunt up the stairs to the still room wherein the four assistants were working You can all go to bed now said Madame Coralie with a glance at the clock on the mantelpiece Zobeide she used her fingers at this point you can go to bed Badoura Miss Branwin is staying here for the night We spoke when she saw me the other day about treating her for the figure as she is much too thin She only made up her mind to come to night See that the bedroom opposite No is made ready Badoura Yes Madame said Badoura and whatever she may have thought of the young lady s unexpected decision to remain for the night she certainly showed no astonishment in her face as she disappeared The other three girls departed swiftly evidently glad to get to bed as they were tired with their work Audrey and her aunt were left alone and the girl would have spoken No said Madame Coralie quickly raising her hand don t speak or you will faint You are highly strung my dear and this position is too much for you Get a night s rest and we can talk in the morning But I must thank you Aunt Flora for your kindness My kindness said the other bitterly and her harsh voice took on a softer note It is a kindness your coming to me to cheer me in my loneliness I hope you will stay long But you have your husband Aunt Flora Eddy oh yes but he does not sleep in this place I found him such a nuisance that I gave him money to take chambers I see very little of him as I found what a mistake I had made in marrying him He cares nothing for me but a great deal for what money I have Don t speak of him Before Audrey could say anything more Badoura returned with the information that the bedroom was ready Madame Coralie who seemed to be a singularly capable woman who knew her own mind at once insisted that her visitor should retire So it was that in a very short space of time Audrey found herself in a comfortable bed For a few moments she mused on the strange chance that had brought her to sleep in the very house wherein her mother had been murdered then the great fatigue she felt overcame her and she fell into a profound slumber which lasted until the morning So deep it was that she did not even dream At ten o clock next morning she awoke and found her aunt standing beside her with a cup of tea Madame Coralie explained how she had looked in once or twice before but that Audrey had been sleeping so quietly that she had not had the heart to waken her Drink this tea and take another sleep advised Madame Coralie wisely as the more you sleep after last night s experience the better you will feel Audrey who still felt languid willingly consented and Madame went out quietly She did not however through absence of mind quite close the door and Audrey was therefore wakened some time later by the sound of two voices conversing softly At once she remembered that the still room was opposite to the bedroom she occupied Evidently its door was open and as her own door was not closed she could hear very plainly Half awake and half asleep she listened not meaning to eavesdrop but simply because she felt too tired to close the door or to give any evidence of her presence The voices were those of a man and a woman and Audrey recognised the latter one as that of Badoura But who the man was she could not guess You are very cruel said Badoura addressing her companion softly You are tired of me I am sure Well you always worry me so said the man s voice gruffly I can t be always running after you You would not have said that once Eddy replied Badoura and the name suddenly enlightened Audrey to the fact that the forewoman was conversing with Madame Coralie s scampish husband Ashamed of listening even half involuntarily the girl would have risen to close the bedroom door when the next sentence of Badoura made her change her mind If you are going to throw me over cried Badoura passionately I shall tell all I know What do you know demanded Eddy with a sneer There s nothing much you can tell my wife if that is what you mean She thinks that I am all that is bad my dear silly girl And so you are snapped Badoura sharply But does she know that you put back the clock in the still room half an hour on the night Lady Branwin It s a confounded lie gasped Eddy Vail interrupting It s true and you know it said Badoura triumphantly I was behind the curtain with Parizade working when you came in about five minutes to eight o clock Parizade is blind and saw nothing but I did You put back the hand of the clock to What if I did stammered Eddy evidently trying to bluff the girl What if you did cried Badoura shrilly Why it means that you were downstairs at the time Lady Branwin was murdered You stayed until the clock hand was again nearly at eight and then your wife came up so that you were able to prove an alibi I said nothing because I loved you but since you are going to treat me like dirt I shall tell the police You dare and I ll kill you said Vail between his teeth As you killed Lady Branwin scoffed Badoura who was in a towering rage I didn t kill her Yes you did and you stole the diamonds and Hush there s Madame Then Audrey heard Badoura quickly leave the room and the sound of Eddy throwing
