When the old horse Ebenezer stood in his stall in the barn he was always glad to talk with anybody that came along Henrietta Hen sometimes strolled into the horse barn to see if she could find a little grain that had spilled on the floor So it came about that she and Ebenezer had many a chat together Henrietta had no great opinion of horses She thought that they had altogether more than their share of grain But she was willing to pass the time of day with Ebenezer because he let her walk right into his stall and pick up tidbits[Pg ] that had dropped upon the floor beneath his manger It was on such an occasion on a summer s day that he said to her with a sigh Haying s going to begin to morrow Henrietta Hen remarked that she wasn t at all interested in the news And I don t see why you should sigh she added Goodness knows you ll eat your share of the hay and probably more before the winter s over It s the work that I m thinking of Ebenezer explained They ll hitch me to the hayrake and Johnnie Green will drive me all day long in the hot hayfields I always hate to hear the clatter of the mowing machine he groaned It means that the hayrake will come out of the shed next Henrietta Hen caught her breath The mowing machine she gasped Is Farmer Green going to use the mowing machine now Certainly said Ebenezer I hear he s going to harness the bays to it to morrow morning My my Henrietta wailed Isn t there any way I can stop him from doing that I don t know of any Ebenezer told her I ve often felt just as you do about it There s nobody that dreads hearing the mowing machine more than I do You can t feel the way I do Henrietta declared On the contrary the old horse insisted I don t see how it can matter to you in the least You don t have to pull the mowing machine nor the hayrake Besides didn t you just tell me that my news about haying didn t interest you But it does Henrietta cried I was mistaken It means everything to me It s the worst news I ever heard in all my life Old Ebenezer looked down at her with mild astonishment on his long honest face Why is it bad news he inquired If you ll tell me perhaps I can help you So Henrietta Hen explained her difficulty Whatever it was it amazed Ebenezer And he had to admit that he could think of no way out of the trouble It was very very careless of you he told Henrietta Then suddenly he had a happy thought Cheer up he cried If Farmer Green sits on them maybe they ll hatch Hatch she groaned They ll break And she ran out of the stall and hurried into the yard She was just in time to hear Farmer Green calling to his son Johnnie Look here said he I started to oil the mowing machine so I could use it to morrow and just see what I found in the seat Johnnie Green came a running And there in the seat of the mowing machine nestling in the hay which had been put there for a cushion the summer before three eggs greeted Johnnie s eyes They must belong to the speckled hen Johnnie decided I knew she d stolen her nest again I couldn t find it anywhere He picked up the eggs and put them in his hat She s a sly one he said That remark made Henrietta Hen somewhat angry At the same time she was glad that Farmer Green had discovered the eggs before it was too late She[Pg ] wouldn t have liked him to sit on them It always upset her to see her eggs broken hitch v n They had an eighty mile journey and decided to hitch hike All the candidates are able to answer the questions without any hitch clatter v n The dishes and bowls slid together with a clatter Don t clatter your knives and forks mowing n v mow The lawn needs mowing Do you use it for mowing groaned v groan He groaned in anguish The cart groaned under the weight of the piano gasped v gasp She gasped at the wonderful view People gasped with admiration at the superb skill of the gymnasts wailed v wail She wailed over her father s remains The women of the town wailed over the war victims dreads n dread v dread The little boy dreads going to bed in the dark A burnt child dreads the fire [ ] astonishment n They heard him give a loud shout of astonishment I was filled with astonishment at her strange action decided adj This gave them a decided advantage over their opponents There is a decided difference between British and Chinese way of greeting
