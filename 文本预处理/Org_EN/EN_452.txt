One bright morning unwonted velvet shone unwonted feathers waved and horses hoofs glinted and ran through the streets of Tergou and the windows and balconies were studded with wondering faces The French ambassador was riding through to sport in the neighbouring forest Besides his own suite he was attended by several servants of the Duke of Burgundy lent to do him honour and minister to his pleasure The Duke s tumbler rode before him with a grave sedate majesty that made his more noble companions seem light frivolous persons But ever and anon when respect and awe neared the oppressive he rolled off his horse so ignobly and funnily that even the ambassador was fain to burst out laughing He also climbed up again by the tail in a way provocative of mirth and so he played his part Towards the rear of the pageant rode one that excited more attention still the Duke s leopard A huntsman mounted on a Flemish horse of giant prodigious size and power carried a long box fastened to the rider s loins by straps curiously contrived and on this box sat a bright leopard crouching She was chained to the huntsman The people admired her glossy hide and spots and pressed near and one or two were for feeling her and pulling her tail then the huntsman shouted in a terrible voice Beware At Antwerp one did but throw a handful of dust at her and the Duke made dust of him Gramercy I speak sooth The good Duke shut him up in prison in a cell under ground and the rats cleaned the flesh off his bones in a night Served him right for molesting the poor thing There was a murmur of fear and the Tergovians shrank from tickling the leopard of their sovereign But an incident followed that raised their spirits again The Duke s giant a Hungarian seven feet four inches high brought up the rear This enormous creature had like some other giants a treble fluty voice of little power He was a vain fellow and not conscious of this nor any defect Now it happened he caught sight of Giles sitting on the top of the balcony so he stopped and began to make fun of him Hallo brother squeaked he I had nearly passed without seeing thee You are plain enough to see bellowed Giles in his bass tones Come on my shoulder brother squeaked Titan and held out a shoulder of mutton fist to help him down If I do I ll cuff your ears roared the dwarf The giant saw the homuncule was irascible and played upon him being encouraged thereto by the shouts of laughter For he did not see that the people were laughing not at his wit but at the ridiculous incongruity of the two voices the gigantic feeble fife and the petty deep loud drum the mountain delivered of a squeak and the mole hill belching thunder The singular duet came to as singular an end Giles lost all patience and self command and being a creature devoid of fear and in a rage to boot he actually dropped upon the giant s neck seized his hair with one hand and punched his head with the other The giant s first impulse was to laugh but the weight and rapidity of the blows soon corrected that inclination He he Ah ha hallo oh oh Holy saints here help or I must throttle the imp I can t I ll split your skull against the and he made a wild run backwards at the balcony Giles saw his danger seized the balcony in time with both hands and whipped over it just as the giant s head came against it with a stunning crack The people roared with laughter and exultation at the address of their little champion The indignant giant seized two of the laughers knocked them together like dumb bells shook them and strewed them flat Catherine shrieked and threw her apron over Giles then strode wrathfully away after the party This incident had consequences no one then present foresaw Its immediate results were agreeable The Tergovians turned proud of Giles and listened with more affability to his prayers for parchment For he drove a regular trade with his brother Gerard in this article Went about and begged it gratis and Gerard gave him coppers for it On the afternoon of the same day Catherine and her daughter were chatting together about their favourite theme Gerard his goodness his benefice and the brightened prospects of the whole family Their good luck had come to them in the very shape they would have chosen besides the advantages of a benefice such as the Countess Charolois would not disdain to give there was the feminine delight at having a priest a holy man in their own family He will marry Cornelis and Sybrandt for they can wed good housewives now if they will Gerard will take care of you and Giles when we are gone Yes mother and we can confess to him instead of to a stranger said Kate Ay girl and he can give the sacred oil to your father and me and close our eyes when our time comes Oh mother not for many many years I do pray Heaven Pray speak not of that it always makes me sad I hope to go before you mother dear No let us be gay to day I am out of pain mother quite out of all pain it does seem so strange and I feel so bright and happy that mother Can you keep a secret Nobody better child Why you know I can Then I will show you something so beautiful You never saw the like I trow Only Gerard must never know for sure he means to surprise us with it he covers it up so and sometimes he carries it away altogether Kate took her crutches and moved slowly away leaving her mother in an exalted state of curiosity She soon returned with something in a cloth uncovered it and there was a lovely picture of the Virgin with all her insignia and wearing her tiara over a wealth of beautiful hair which flowed loose over her shoulders Catherine at first was struck with awe It is herself she cried it is the Queen of Heaven I never saw one like her to my mind before And her eyes mother lifted to the sky as if they belonged there and not to a mortal creature And her beautiful hair of burning gold And to think I have a son that can make the saints live again upon a piece of wood The reason is he is a young saint himself mother He is too good for this world he is here to portray the blessed and then to go away and be with them for ever Ere they had half done admiring it a strange voice was heard at the door By one of the furtive instincts of their sex they hastily hid the picture in the cloth though there was no need And the next moment in came casting his eyes furtively around a man that had not entered the house this ten years Ghysbrecht Van Swieten The two women were so taken by surprise that they merely stared at him and at one another and said The burgomaster in a tone so expressive that Ghysbrecht felt compelled to answer it Yes I own the last time I came here was not on a friendly errand Men love their own interest Eli s and mine were contrary Well let this visit atone the last To day I come on your business and none of mine Catherine and her daughter exchanged a swift glance of contemptuous incredulity They knew the man better than he thought It is about your son Gerard Ay ay you want him to work for the town all for nothing He told us I come on no such errand It is to let you know he has fallen into bad hands Now Heaven and the saints forbid Man torture not a mother Speak out and quickly speak ere you have time to coin falsehood we know thee Ghysbrecht turned pale at this affront and spite mingled with the other motives that brought him here Thus it is then said he grinding his teeth and speaking very fast Your son Gerard is more like to be father of a family than a priest he is for ever with Margaret Peter Brandt s red haired girl and loves her like a cow her calf Mother and daughter both burst out laughing Ghysbrecht stared at them What you knew it Carry this tale to those who know not my son Gerard Women are nought to him Other women mayhap But this one is the apple of his eye to him or will be if you part them not and soon Come dame make me not waste time and friendly counsel my servant has seen them together a score times handed and reading babies in one another s eyes like you know dame you have been young too Girl I am ill at ease Yea I have been young and know how blind and foolish the young are My heart he has turned me sick in a moment Kate if it should be true Nay nay cried Kate eagerly Gerard might love a young woman all young men do I can t find what they see in them to love so but if he did he would let us know he would not deceive us You wicked man No dear mother look not so Gerard is too good to love a creature of earth His love is for our Lady and the saints Ah I will show you the picture there if his heart was earthly could he paint the Queen of Heaven like that look look and she held the picture out triumphantly and more radiant and beautiful in this moment of enthusiasm than ever dead picture was or will be over powered the burgomaster with her eloquence and her feminine proof of Gerard s purity His eyes and mouth opened and remained open in which state they kept turning face and all as if on a pivot from the picture to the women and from the women to the picture Why it is herself he gasped Isn t it cried Kate and her hostility was softened You admire it I forgive you for frightening us Am I in a mad house said Ghysbrecht Van Swieten thoroughly puzzled You show me a picture of the girl and you say he painted it and that is a proof he cannot love her Why they all paint their sweethearts painters do A picture of the girl exclaimed Kate shocked Fie this is no girl this is our blessed Lady No no it is Margaret Brandt Oh blind It is the Queen of Heaven No only of Sevenbergen village Profane man behold her crown Silly child look at her red hair Would the Virgin be seen in red hair She who had the pick of all the colours ten thousand years before the world began At this moment an anxious face was insinuated round the edge of the open door it was their neighbour Peter Buyskens What is to do said he in a cautious whisper We can hear you all across the street What on earth is to do Oh neighbour What is to do Why here is the burgomaster blackening our Gerard Stop cried Van Swieten Peter Buyskens is come in the nick of time He knows father and daughter both They cast their glamour on him What is she a witch too Else the egg takes not after the bird Why is her father called the magician I tell you they bewitched this very Peter here they cast unholy spells on him and cured him of the colic now Peter look and tell me who is that and you be silent women for a moment if you can who is it Peter Well to be sure said Peter in reply and his eye seemed fascinated by the picture Who is it repeated Ghysbrecht impetuously Peter Buyskens smiled Why you know as well as I do but what have they put a crown on her for I never saw her in a crown for my part Man alive Can t you open your great jaws and just speak a wench s name plain out to oblige three people I d do a great deal more to oblige one of you than that burgomaster If it isn t as natural as life Curse the man he won t he won t curse him Why what have I done now Oh sir said little Kate for pity s sake tell us are these the features of a living woman of of Margaret Brandt A mirror is not truer my little maid But is it she sir for very certain Why who else should it be Now why couldn t you say so at once snarled Ghysbrecht I did say so as plain as I could speak snapped Peter and they growled over this small bone of contention so zealously that they did not see Catherine and her daughter had thrown their aprons over their heads and were rocking to and fro in deep distress The next moment Elias came in from the shop and stood aghast Catherine though her face was covered knew his footstep That is my poor man she sobbed Tell him good Peter Buyskens for I have not the courage Elias turned pale The presence of the burgomaster in his house after so many years of coolness coupled with his wife s and daughter s distress made him fear some heavy misfortune Richart Jacob he gasped No no said the burgomaster it is nearer home and nobody is dead or dying old friend God bless you burgomaster Ah something has gone off my breast that was like to choke me Now what is the matter Ghysbrecht then told him all that he told the women and showed the picture in evidence Is that all said Eli profoundly relieved What are ye roaring and bellowing for It is vexing it is angering but it is not like death not even sickness Boys will be boys He will outgrow that disease tis but skin deep But when Ghysbrecht told him that Margaret was a girl of good character that it was not to be supposed she would be so intimate if marriage had not been spoken of between them his brow darkened Marriage that shall never be said he sternly I ll stay that ay by force if need be as I would his hand lifted to cut his throat I d do what old John Koestein did t other day And what is that in Heaven s name asked the mother suddenly removing her apron It was the burgomaster who replied He made me shut young Albert Koestein up in the prison of the Stadthouse till he knocked under It was not long forty eight hours all alone on bread and water cooled his hot stomach Tell my father I am his humble servant says he and let me into the sun once more the sun is worth all the wenches in the world Oh the cruelty of men sighed Catherine As to that the burgomaster has no choice it is the law And if a father says Burgomaster lock up my son he must do it A fine thing it would be if a father might not lock up his own son Well well it won t come to that with me and my son He never disobeyed me in his life he never shall Where is he It is past supper time Where is he Kate Alas I know not father I know said Ghysbrecht he is at Sevenbergen My servant met him on the road Supper passed in gloomy silence Evening descended no Gerard Eight o clock came no Gerard Then the father sent all to bed except Catherine You and I will walk abroad wife and talk over this new care Abroad my man at this time Whither Why on the road to Sevenbergen Oh no no hasty words father Poor Gerard he never vexed you before Fear me not But it must end and I am not one that trusts to morrow with to day s work The old pair walked hand in hand for strange is it may appear to some of my readers the use of the elbow to couples walking was not discovered in Europe till centuries after this They sauntered on a long time in silence The night was clear and balmy Such nights calm and silent recall the past from the dead It is a many years since we walked so late my man said Catherine softly Ay sweetheart more than we shall see again is he never coming I wonder Not since our courting days Eli No Ay you were a buxom lass then And you were a comely lad as ever a girl s eye stole a look at I do suppose Gerard is with her now as you used to be with me Nature is strong and the same in all our generations Nay I hope he has left her by now confound her or we shall be here all night Eli Well Kate I have been happy with you sweetheart for all our rubs much happier I trow than if I had been a a nun You won t speak harshly to the poor child One can be firm without being harsh Surely Have you been happy with me my poor Eli Why you know I have Friends I have known but none like thee Buss me wife A heart to share joy and grief with is a great comfort to man or woman Isn t it Eli It is so my lass It doth joy double And halveth trouble runs the byword And so I have found it sweetheart Ah here comes the young fool Catherine trembled and held her husband s hand tight The moon was bright but they were in the shadow of
