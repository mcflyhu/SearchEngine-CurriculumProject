Next day Carl was still feeling unsteady and ill but on the following morning he felt well enough to guide Bob to the new apiary site and the two boys went off together They returned full of enthusiasm There must be half a square mile of basswood trees said Bob So we d have a double chance if the berries failed Yes and the best is that there s a road going to the place Carl added The old lumber road I told you about It comes out on the road to Morton a mile or so from here It would only need a day or two with an ax to clear it out for a wagon to pass This yard is certainly getting crowded said Alice thoughtfully With all the new swarms we ll have over two hundred colonies soon and a hundred is as many as most locations will support But what about the expense of moving It would cost six dollars a day to get a team from Morton and we d have to build a honey house there too I believe it would pay us even if it cost a hundred dollars said Carl But I suppose we can t do anything till some one goes to Morton and gets Mr Farr s permission to move them The mortgage says they re not to be moved without permission This was undoubtedly the case and as none of them had time to go to the village just then the matter was dropped temporarily But new events speedily made it a live issue again A little warm rain fell in the afternoon and next morning the honey flow which had been failing began again profusely And then suddenly a riot of swarming broke out among the bees A slow light honey flow always induces more swarming than a heavy one and Alice had been nervous about the matter for some days On this morning she went out with Carl to examine a few of the hives and in the very first they found what they had feared to find a cluster of the peanut shaped queen cells They were not quite sealed but would have been finished the next day and the colony would have swarmed Carl cut them all out This treatment usually delays swarming at any rate for a week till the colony can raise a fresh batch of cells But occasionally when they have the swarming fever badly they will swarm cells or not and it is moreover very difficult to make sure of destroying every cell on ten combs swarming with bees The next colony had three heavy supers of honey piled on top of the brood chamber and when they got down to it at last they found no signs of swarming But the third colony had cells just started Growing uneasy they went to look at the hive where the three dollar queen had been placed They could not afford to let that queen lead her bees away to the woods but there was not much danger of it for a queen less than a year old seldom swarms But on opening the hive they found the brood combs choked with honey few eggs laid and swarming cells well under way Why this queen must be no good exclaimed Carl No it isn t that replied Alice But a queen never lays well just after she s come out of the mailing cage and the bees have got ahead of her and filled up the combs with honey where the brood should be The poor queen has no room left to lay in she feels crowded and that s what gave them the idea of swarming It was lucky they had discovered it in time They cut out the incipient queen cells gave empty combs and felt sure that they had made the colony safe They were just proceeding to another of the colonies where one of the new queens was when with a loud roaring a storm of bees began to volley out of a hive at the farthest end of the yard They surged about wildly in the air for some time and then settled in a cluster on the tip of a small cedar where swarms had alighted several times before Alice kept an eye on them while Carl hurried off to the barn for fresh hives Before he could get back another swarm roared out of a second hive eddied about like a cloud of smoke and finally settled And then a third hive swarmed When bees are in the mood for it the flying of a single swarm will sometimes start a perfect uproar of swarming throughout an apiary and colonies will become carried away by the excitement and swarm without being normally ready for it That seemed to be the case this time Bob came running out to help but a fourth swarm was already in the air Then came two more which united and settled in one enormous cluster the size of a large bucket Bees fairly darkened the air the apiarists lost track of how many swarms were out or where they came from and the noise was like a small tornado The three rushed about frantically gathering up such clustered swarms as they could most easily reach and Bob was instructed to dash a dipperful of water right into the top of every colony that might be likely to abscond Such a drenching is an effectual check to swarming for that day at any rate and does the bees no harm This vigorous treatment produced some quiet No more swarms had emerged for about fifteen minutes when the familiar crescendo roar sounded again and Bob uttered a despairing yell From the three dollar queen s colony the bees were pouring out like steam from an escape valve Oh don t let them go shrieked Alice Bob rushed up and dashed water into the entrance Carl poured in a volume of smoke but nothing could stop them There was already an enormous cloud of bees circling over the hive and the only thing now was to wait till they had clustered But they did not seem inclined to cluster The swarm drifted about uncertainly here and there now high now low and finally began to edge toward the river Expecting that they would settle on the willows by the water the three apiarists followed it anxiously But it did not settle It went over the trees and out above the stream They re going across They re making straight for the woods cried Alice That queen is lost No they ll surely cluster a little further on Bob exclaimed I m going to follow them up We can t lose that queen I ll bring them back He snatched up a grain sack that they had already been using in collecting swarms jumped into the boat and rowed himself across the river The runaways did not travel very fast and he could see the swarm gyrating and drifting like a cloud of smoke over the trees But it moved too fast for him to keep up with it over that rough ground He kept it in sight for nearly a quarter of a mile and then it faded like mist into the sky It might be that the bees had already selected some hollow tree for their new home and had gone straight to it without clustering This sometimes happens but very rarely a swarm almost always settles and hangs for some time probably as a means of getting its force together ready for the final journey and Bob felt sure that this swarm would sooner or later settle on a branch He kept on therefore scrutinizing the trees carefully for a pendant brown bunch No such thing appeared and though he stopped and listened at every few rods he did not hear the humming drone that a swarm keeps up for some time after it has settled He lost count of distance stumbling along with his eyes in the air but he must have gone a mile from the apiary when he was stopped by a savage guttural grunt apparently close by Just ahead of him was a dense clump of willows and alders fringing a small stream and as he gazed he thought he saw the dim outline of an animal through the shrubbery something large and tall like a buck Anxious to get a look Bob edged sideways and parted the willows a little He was thunderstruck to see a bull moose standing in the shallow water and glaring at him Now he remembered having heard at Morton that moose had lately been seen in this district At one time they were plentiful then for years they had vanished and were only beginning to reappear as they strayed south from the great game preserves to the north At most times of the year they are exceedingly shy and timid animals hard to get in view Bob was amazed that this one had let him come up so close and he was edging forward to get a better look through the tangle of under brush in front of him when the animal charged at him furiously He jumped aside found himself near a low branched cedar and scrambled up it He had just time to draw his legs out of reach when the moose crashed into the tree with a force that jarred it to the roots When Bob recovered his breath he had time to feel astonished and indignant at this unprovoked attack Bull moose are sometimes dangerous in the rutting season of autumn but never in early summer and the horns of this one had not yet quite outgrown their velvet But he was clearly in a murderous temper He stamped tore up the earth and brushes around the cedar gritted his teeth and cocked his eye upward at the bee keeper with a baleful glare Then all at once Bob saw what was the matter The lower part of the bull s right shoulder was mangled and torn with wounds that were evidently not more than a day or two old They might have been made by the claws of a bear more likely by a charge of buckshot Anyhow they were enough to account for a good deal of bad temper for they must have caused intense pain But the bull s hostility did not seem to last long Bob was looking upwards to see if he could climb higher in his tree and when he glanced down again the space beneath him was empty The moose had slipped silently away into the woods Whether he had really fled or was merely hiding in a near by thicket Bob could not tell He hesitated to come down and for some minutes he sat dubiously in the branches looking carefully about him for the enemy Then something caught his eye that gave him a joyful surprise About twenty yards away there was a great brownish lump clustered at the tip of a low maple sapling which bent slightly under the weight Bob stared at it intently It was certainly a swarm of bees It could hardly be any other than the one he was chasing If it had not been for the bull moose he might not have seen them for they were aside from the straight line and so near the ground that an elevated post was needed to distinguish them He was desperately anxious to secure them now for there was no telling when they might take wing again He waited for some ten minutes very impatiently No sign nor sound came from the moose and Bob slid to earth and hastened toward the little maple The little tree had sagged over so that the swarm hung no higher than his shoulders and it could be captured in the neatest possible manner He carefully slipped the mouth of his sack over the swarm till the whole cluster was inside Then he gathered the sack around the branch they hung by and shook it violently There was a sudden roar and a heavy weight dropped into the sack He had secured all the swarm except for a few bees that flew about in wild dismay at this disappearance of their comrades Much elated Bob turned back toward home The sack hummed and stirred with the efforts of the angry insects to get out But he had hardly gone ten yards when something stirred in the underbrush He stopped startled The next instant a fearful bellow filled his ears and the wounded bull burst through a curtain of evergreens Bob turned and ran as fast as he could still clinging to the sack Luckily the bull was somewhat lame from his wound and not in his regular racing form At is was Bob was almost run down he saved himself only by leaping aside and changing his direction All the time he kept on the lookout for a tree that he could climb and he clung tightly to the sack He was determined not to drop it except as a last resort for the mouth was not tied and the bees would escape at once The hoofs of the bull clattered behind him He dodged wildly again swerved behind a tree and caught sight of a dead hemlock trunk that was spiked with short branches and leaned at a decided angle It was almost as easy to climb as a ladder and Bob scrambled up to safety still carrying his swarm The bull s disappointed fury was now uncontrollable He roared frightfully his black mane stood stiffly on end and he gritted and gnashed his teeth Probably by this time he had got Bob thoroughly associated with the pain that he was suffering and it was too much for him to be twice checked in his revenge He reared up with his fore feet against the trunk of the hemlock Then he drew back a few yards and charged into it with such force that to Bob s horror it gave slightly and leaned even farther over than before Evidently the roots were rotten and held insecurely It was no place of safety after all Again the bull crashed into the trunk and this time with an ominous creaking it went over more than a foot This result seemed to encourage the bull greatly He rammed his head against the trunk and pushed hard Bob heard the rotten roots snapping Pausing now and again to glance up at Bob with what seemed a gleam of savage triumph in his eye the bull continued to butt and push Bob clung in his tree panic stricken while it swayed over farther and farther In a few seconds he would surely be hurled under the brute s hoofs Then it flashed upon him that he had one weapon left and a terrible one He disliked to use it even to save his life but another charge of the bull and a heavy lurch of the almost uprooted tree convinced him that he must not hesitate He held the sack directly over the bull s head and shook out the swarm At the same time he ducked quickly and snatched his coat up to cover his own face There was a hissing roar as though from a burst steam pipe and he felt a dozen burning stings on his hands Then he heard a sudden astonished snort from the bull and a sound of furious trampling He ventured to peep through an opening in his coat The air round him was full of bees and the bull s face and head seemed covered with a surging brown mass Thousands of bees were clinging and stinging pitilessly while the animal rushed about fiercely shaking its head and bellowing with pain and fury Blindly it started to bolt and collided heavily with a tree It made a fresh start and splashed into the brook From the sounds it seemed to be rolling in the water Probably it got rid of some of its tormentors in this way but certainly not of all It dashed out of the creek bolted past Bob s tree knots of maddened bees still clinging to its hide and crashed through the underbrush straight away into the woods There was no doubt that it was gone this time for Bob could hear its smashing rush fully half a mile away Bob was stung a good deal himself but this seemed a very light matter He slipped to the ground and lost no time in finding a safer place for the air was still full of savagely excited bees Here he remained for half an hour picking the stings out of his skin and waiting till he considered it safe to go home He might as well recover the sack he thought before he left and he went to get it regretting bitterly the loss of the swarm No doubt it had saved his life it could not be helped but still it was a shame to lose Alice s three dollar bee But as he approached his former perch he was surprised to find that the bees had collected again Not all of them indeed instead of the big swarm there was now only about a quart of bees in a little bunch on a cedar twig But they would hardly have gathered there if the queen had not been with them and Bob bent over the cluster and looked at it closely They had got over their stinging fury now He was able to scrutinize them carefully and in a few seconds he made out the slender graceful body of the yellow Italian queen as she crawled about among her bees Full of delight he slipped the sack over it shook the bees off and started hastily for home More than half were lost to be sure but he would have sacrificed all the rest of the swarm to have saved the queen He reached the river without seeing anything more of the bull ferried himself across and went up to the apiary where Carl and Alice were still working hard I ve got em he cried triumphantly as he appeared Got them his brother exclaimed Looks as if they d got you Bob s face was indeed a shocking sight A bee keeper usually becomes hardened to stings so that they do not cause swellings but Bob had not yet become sufficiently inoculated There were big lumps on his forehead one eye was nearly closed his chin was lopsided and both his hands were somewhat puffed But he was highly elated at having recovered the swarm with the valuable queen which they at once carefully restored to a hive There old lady said Carl as he saw the yellow queen creep into the hive with her bees you ve had enough wild life now and you d better settle down to business Bob gave them a brief account of what had happened while he helped them sort out the swarms but in the course of another hour his eye closed so badly that he was obliged to retire to the cabin Several more swarms had come out while he had been gone but all of them had been recovered and by that night they had twenty eight new colonies more than they had bought The apiary was certainly far too crowded and doubtless there would be still more swarming before the season was over Some of them ought to be moved to another spot and the sooner this could be done the better The next day was hot and dry No honey appeared to be coming in and no swarms went out and early the following morning Carl paddled the boat down to Morton He had no difficulty in securing Mr Farr s written consent to moving part of the bees to the new location by the lake He ordered a two horse team and hayrack to come out to the apiary the next day and came home with a roll of wire gauze and several papers of tacks It took a day to clear away the bushes and brush from the old road but it was ready when the wagon arrived from Morton and they moved fifty colonies the next night in two loads The next morning they moved another load by daylight It was hard tedious work to load and unload the heavy hives and the wagon had to move slowly all the way It was dangerous work too though the entrances of the hives were closed with wire gauze an aperture might develop through which the bees could rush out and the result would probably be stung horses a runaway and a line of smashed hives scattered along the road One of the boys walked with a lighted smoker beside the load all the way on the watch for possible trouble and they all breathed much more freely when the hives were off the wagon They set them on large stones a few rods back from the water Later they could make regular stands for them and before another season of course they would have to build a small house for extracting and storing the apparatus For the present they contented themselves with a tiny hut no bigger than a piano case built of rough logs in which to store tools and a few frames extra hives and odds and ends Most of the colonies in the new yard were old ones that had swarmed and were weak in bees They would gather no more surplus honey and would need little attention this year but would build up strong for the next season The day of the swarming riot was the last really good day of the raspberry bloom The effect of the shower had been transient The weather turned hot and dry The honey dried up in the flowers and the discouraged bees worked only for an hour or two early every morning If it would only rain really rain hard groaned Alice Unless it does the honey flow is certainly at an end said Carl anxiously The berry bloom won t last long in this drought and I m certain there s nothing like a thousand dollars worth of honey in the supers now No or five hundred added Bob In fact the earliest raspberry blossoms were now replaced by green fruit If rain should fall in time the later bloom might last for a week more and there was the basswood flowering still to come But the weather remained hot and dry and there was no dew at night Alice s garden withered though she watered it every evening Twice clouds rolled up from the south and they heard thunder It must have rained within ten miles but not a drop fell at the apiary Even half an hour s shower would mean a couple of days honey flow said Bob But it did not come Now and again a little moisture in the air set the bees working for an hour or two but most of the time they were idle As usual in a honey dearth they became bad tempered Their owners could no longer stroll about among the hives with impunity The bees came into the cabin attracted by one of the pails of candied honey and would have carried every morsel of it away if they had been permitted Robber bees were prowling about every hive looking for a chance to steal a little sweet from some careless colony but every entrance was alive with alert guards and no bee was allowed to pass in without being examined and smelt all over The robbers did get a foothold in one weak colony however and before the apiarists saw it it was besieged by a cloud of bees They carried it by assault too after half an hour s fighting killed the defenders tore down most of the combs and carried every drop of the honey away to their own hive Then they turned their attention to the hive standing next in the row but this was a powerful colony and the raiders got more than they bargained for In a moment the entrance was covered with knots of furiously fighting bees Every robber was pounced upon the moment it alighted The attack was beaten off and for a time quiet reigned in the yard Day by day the raspberry bloom vanished and no fresh buds were opening now The time came at last when it was entirely gone and all the thickets were covered with fruit The basswood trees were full of buds but would they yield nectar It was the middle of July In two weeks they must pay five hundred dollars with interest and they did not have the money Unless they could make it the bees would be taken from them If the basswood only yields as it should we ll manage it after all said Bob trying to be optimistic Alas the basswood flowered in the midst of a hot wave when the whole land lay baked and panting The bloom lasted only a day or two dried up and withered Scarcely a bee had touched the blossoms The Harmans felt unspeakably gloomy and discouraged The failure of their hopes after so much anticipation labor and experience was hard to bear We may as well look the thing square in the face Allie said Carl one morning when he was alone with his sister in the cabin The season s over and it s a failure I don t know how we ll save the bees Surely we ll have money enough to pay Mr Farr We must save the bees if we starve ourselves for they mean everything to us How much money have we left About two hundred dollars It has just melted away with all the expenses of fresh supplies and sugar and then the cost of establishing the new yard besides our own living Well surely we can get three hundred dollars worth of honey to make up enough for our payment We can manage to live some way and rub along till another season comes Well that s what I wanted to talk about went on Carl earnestly You see Bob s university work mustn t be interrupted on any account He ll want to drop it I know to save the money but we mustn t let him We ve got to find the money somehow Now I ve been thinking that you might go back to Harman s Corners where you could live in our old house for little or nothing and I might get some kind of a job in Toronto You re right Alice agreed Bob must keep up his work But I wouldn t stay at home all alone I d rather get a job in Toronto too Then began a long discussion of plans but they revealed nothing of all this to Bob That very evening however Bob proposed that his sister take a walk with him This investment hasn t panned out Alice he said when they were well away from the cabin We re not going to make a cent profit this year I blame myself for it for I got you both into it Nonsense Bob returned Alice We were just as eager as you were We all rushed into it and we all knew that it was a gamble on the weather Well anyhow I m not going back to college next term Carl will want me to I know but you must back me up I couldn t use any money that way We ll be hard up at the best and I won t have you two rob yourselves for my support Oh Bob You must go back Well I won t What s a year lost anyhow But I m uncertain what to do I could come up here and trap all winter I m sure I could make several hundred dollars all clear profit but trapping is a sort of gamble too Or I could get a job any time with the Toronto Electric Company at about fifteen a week Trapping would be more fun but the other would be surer and I d get a lot of practical experience What do you think I don t know said Alice half laughing and half crying Oh I don t know Bob I think I think we d better harvest our honey first and see how it turns out And the next day
