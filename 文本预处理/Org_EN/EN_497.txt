There were other Americans in Cubitas as O Reilly soon discovered During his first inspection of the village he heard himself hailed in his own language and a young man in dirty white trousers and jacket strode toward him Welcome to our city the stranger cried I m Judson Captain of Artillery Departmento del Oriente and you re the fellow who came with that quinine lady aren t you O Reilly acknowledged his identity and Judson grinned The whole camp is talking about her and those mangoes Jove It s a wonder she didn t die of fright Something tells me you re Irish Anyhow you look as if you d enjoy a scrap Know anything about artillery Nothing whatever I m sorry We need gunners Still you know as much as the rest of us did when we came I m not a fighter Johnnie told him I m here on other business Captain Judson was plainly disappointed Nevertheless he volunteered to assist his countryman in any way possible Have you met the old man he inquired General Gomez No I d like to meet him Come along then I ll introduce you This is about the right time of day for it he ll probably be in good humor He has dyspepsia you know and he s not always pleasant It was nearly sundown the eastern slopes were in shadow and supper was cooking As the two men passed down the wide street between its rows of bohios the fragrance of burning fagots was heavy in the air that odor which is sweet in the nostrils of every man who knows and loves the out of doors To O Reilly it was like the scents of Araby for his hopes were high his feet were light and he believed his goal was in sight Gen Maximo Gomez father of patriots bulwark of the Cuban cause was seated in a hammock reading some letters O Reilly recognized him instantly from the many pictures he had seen Gomez was a keen wiry old man the color of his swarthy sun bitten cheeks was thrown into deeper relief by his snow white mustache and goatee He looked up at Judson s salute and then turned a pail of brilliant eyes as hard as glass upon O Reilly His was an irascible brooding face it had in it something of the sternness the exalted detachment of the eagle and O Reilly gained a hint of the personality behind it Maximo Gomez was counted one of the world s ablest guerrilla leaders and indeed it had required the quenchless enthusiasm of a real military genius to fuse into a homogeneous fighting force the ill assorted rabble of nondescripts whom Gomez led to school them to privation and to render them sufficiently mobile to defy successfully ten times their number of trained troops This however was precisely what the old Porto Rican had done and in doing it he had won the admiration of military students He it was more than any other who bore the burden of Cuba s unequal struggle it was Gomez s cunning and Gomez s indomitable will which had already subjugated half the island of Cuba it was Gomez s stubborn unflagging resistance which was destined to shatter for all time the hopes of Spain in the New World With a bluntness not unkind he asked O Reilly what had brought him to Cuba Then before the young man could answer he gestured with a letter in his hand saying Major Ramos gives you splendid credit for helping him to land his expedition but he says you didn t come to fight with us What does he mean When O Reilly explained the reason for his presence the old fighter nodded So You wish to go west eh Yes sir I want to find Colonel Lopez Lopez Miguel Lopez the general inquired quickly I believe that s his name at any rate the Colonel Lopez who has been operating in Matanzas Province You see he knows the whereabouts of my friends Well you won t have to look far for him General Gomez s leathery countenance lightened into a smile He happens to be right here in Cubitas Calling Judson to him he said Amigo take Mr O Reilly to Colonel Lopez you will find him somewhere about I am sorry we are not to have this young fellow for a soldier he looks like a real man and quite equal to five quintos eh It was the habit of the Cubans to refer to their enemies as quintos the fifth part of a man With a wave of his hand Gomez returned to his reading As Judson led his companion away he said When you have finished with Lopez come to my shack and we ll have supper and I ll introduce you to the rest of our gang You won t get much to eat for we re short of grub but it s worse where Lopez comes from Col Miguel Lopez a handsome animated fellow took O Reilly s hand in a hearty clasp when they were introduced but a moment later his smile gave way to a frown and his brow darkened So You are that O Reilly from Matanzas said he I know you now but I never expected we would meet Esteban Varona told you about me did he not The colonel inclined his head I m here at last after the devil s own time I ve been trying every way to get through The Spaniards stopped me at Puerto Principe they sent me back home you know I ve been half crazy I You O Reilly swallowed hard You know where Esteban is Tell me Have you heard nothing Nothing whatever That is nothing since Rosa his sister You understand she and I are engaged Yes yes Esteban told me all about you Something in the Cuban s gravity of manner gave O Reilly warning A sudden fear assailed him His voice shook as he asked What is it My God Not bad news There was no need for the officer to answer In his averted gaze O Reilly read confirmation of his sickest apprehensions The men faced each other for a long moment while the color slowly drove out of the American s cheeks leaving him pallid stricken He wet his lips to speak but his voice was no more than a dry throaty rustle Tell me Which one he whispered Both O Reilly recoiled a spasm distorted his chalky face He began to shake weakly and his fingers plucked aimlessly at each other Lopez took him by the arm Try to control yourself said he Sit here while I try to tell you what little I know Or would it not be better to wait awhile until you are calmer As the young man made no answer except to stare at him in a white agony of suspense he sighed Very well then as you wish But you must be a man like the rest of us I too have suffered My father Lopez s mustached lip drew back and his teeth showed through died in the Laurel Ditch at Cabanas On the very day after my first victory they shot him an old man Christ It is because of such things that we Cubans fight while we starve that we shall continue to fight until no Spaniard is left upon this island We have all faced something like that which you are facing now our parents murdered our sisters and our sweethearts wronged O Reilly huddled where he had sunk upon the bench uttered a gasping inarticulate cry and covered his face as if from a lash I will tell you all I know which isn t much Esteban Varona came to me soon after he and his sister had fled from their home he wanted to join my forces but we were harassed on every side and I didn t dare take the girl no woman could have endured the hardships we suffered So I convinced him that his first duty was to her rather than to his country and he agreed He was a fine boy He had spirit He bought some stolen rifles and armed a band of his own which wasn t a bad idea I used to hear about him Nobody cared to molest him I can tell you until finally he killed some of the regular troops Then of course they went after him Meanwhile he managed to destroy his own plantations which Cueto had robbed him of You knew Cueto Yes Well Esteban put an end to him after a while rode right up to La Joya one night broke in the door and macheted the scoundrel in his bed But there was a mistake of some sort It seems that a body of Cobo s Volunteers were somewhere close by and the two parties met I have never learned all the details of the affair and the stories of that fight which came to me are too preposterous for belief Still Esteban and his men must have fought like demons for they killed some incredible number But they were human they could not defeat a regiment It seems that only one or two of them escaped Esteban Did he Colonel Lopez nodded then he said gravely Cobo takes no prisoners I was in the Rubi hills at the time fighting hard and it was six weeks before I got back into Matanzas Naturally when I heard what had happened I tried to find the girl but Weyler was concentrating the pacificos by that time and there was nobody left in the Yumuri it was a desert Then you don t know positively that she that she Wait There is no doubt that the boy was killed but of Rosa s fate I can only form my own opinion However one of Esteban s men joined my troops later and I not only learned something about the girl but also why Esteban had been so relentlessly pursued It was all Cobo s doings You have heard of the fellow No Well you will The speaker s tone was eloquent of hatred He is worse than the worst of them a monster He had seen Miss Varona She was a beautiful girl Go on whispered the lover I discovered that she didn t at first obey Weyler s edict She and the two negroes they were former slaves of her father I believe took refuge in the Pan de Matanzas Later on Cobo s men made a raid and killed a great many Some few escaped into the high ravines but Miss Varona was not one of them Out of regard for Esteban I made careful search but I could find no trace of her And yet you don t know what happened O Reilly ventured You re not sure No but I tell you again Cobo s men take no prisoners When I heard about that raid I gave up looking for her This Cobo the American s voice shook in spite of his effort to hold it steady I shall hope to meet him some time The sudden fury that filled Colonel Lopez s face was almost hidden by the gloom Yes Oh yes he cried quickly and you are but one of a hundred I am another In my command there is a standing order to spare neither Cobo nor any of his assassins they neither expect nor receive quarter from us Now companero the Cuban dropped a hand on O Reilly s bowed head I am sorry that I had to bring you such evil tidings but we are men and this is war No no It isn t war it s merciless savagery To murder children and to outrage women why that violates all the ethics of warfare Ethics the colonel cried harshly Ethics Hell is without ethics Why look for ethics in war Violence injustice insanity chaos THAT is war It is man s agony woman s despair It is a defiance of God War is without mercy without law it is well it is the absence of all law all good There was a considerable silence Then Lopez went on in another key We Cubans carry heavy hearts but our wrongs have made us mighty and our sufferings have made us brave Here in the orient we do well enough but believe me you cannot imagine the desolation and the suffering farther west whole provinces made barren and their inhabitants either dead or dying The world has never seen anything like Weyler s slaughter of the innocents If there is indeed a God and sometimes I doubt it he will not permit this horror to continue from every pool of Cuban blood another patriot will spring up until we drive that archfiend and his armies into the sea Go back to your own country now and if your grief has made you one of us in sympathy tell the world what that black butcher in Havana is doing and beg your Government to recognize our belligerency so that we may have arms ARMS It was some time before O Reilly spoke then he said quietly I am not going back I am going to stay here and look for Rosa So exclaimed the colonel Well why not So long as we do not know precisely what has happened to her we can at least hope But if I were you I would rather think of her as dead than as a prisoner in some concentration camp You don t know what those camps are like my friend but I do Now I shall leave you One needs to be alone at such an hour eh With a pressure of his hand Colonel Lopez walked away into the darkness Judson and his adventurous countryman did not see O Reilly that night nor in fact did any one But the next morning he appeared before General Gomez He was haggard sick listless The old Porto Rican had heard from Lopez in the mean time he was sympathetic I am sorry you came all the way to hear such bad news he said War is a sad hopeless business But I haven t given up hope O Reilly said I want to stay here and and fight I inferred as much from what Lopez told me The general nodded his white head Well you ll make a good soldier and we shall be glad to have you He extended his hand and O Reilly took it gratefully The city of Matanzas was pacified So ran the boastful bando of the captain general And this was no exaggeration as any one could see from the number of beggars there Of all his military operations this pacification of the western towns and provinces was the most conspicuously successful and the one which gave Valeriano Weyler the keenest satisfaction for nowhere did rebellion lift its head except perhaps among the ranks of those disaffected men who hid in the hills with nothing above them but the open sky As for the population at large it was cured of treason it no longer resisted even weakly the law of Spain The reason was that it lay dying Weyler s cure was simple efficacious it consisted of extermination swift and pitiless Poverty had been common in Matanzas even before the war but now there were so many beggars in the city that nobody undertook to count them When the refugees began to pour in by the thousands and when it became apparent that the Government intended to let them starve the better citizens undertook an effort at relief but times were hard food was scarce and prices high Moreover it soon transpired that the military frowned upon everything like organized charity and in consequence the new comers were perforce abandoned to their own devices These country people were dumb and terrified at the misfortunes which had overtaken them they wandered the streets in aimless bewilderment fearful of what blow might next befall They were not used to begging and therefore they did not often implore alms but all day long they asked for work for bread that their little ones might live Work however was even scarcer than food and the time soon came when they crouched upon curbs and door steps hopeless beaten silently reproachful of those more fortunate than they Their eyes grew big and hollow their outstretched hands grew gaunt and skinny The sound of weeping women and fretting babies became a common thing to hear In the suburbs just within the ring of guardian forts an area of cultivation was set aside and here the prisoners put up huts of yagua comfortless bark shelters which were well enough perhaps in fair weather but sadly ineffective against wind and rain Here housed with hunger and crowded together in indescribable squalor they dwelt seeking comfort in their common wretchedness Since they had no farm implements no seeds no means whatever of cultivating this ground apportioned to their use it remained untilled while they grew hungrier day by day Outside the lines there were yams potatoes edible roots and such for the Spaniards work of desolation had not been quite complete and no hand can rob the Cuban soil of all its riches but the pacificos were not allowed to leave the city Fish were plentiful in the harbor too but to catch them was forbidden Sentries were on guard with ready rifles and bared machetes every morning through the filthy reconcentrado quarter guerrillas drove pack mules bearing the mutilated bodies of those who had dared during the night to seek food surreptitiously Sometimes they dragged these ghastly reminders at the ends of ropes this indeed was a favorite way with them Dogs and cats became choice articles of diet until they disappeared The Government did supply one quality of food however at intervals it distributed yucca roots But these were starchy and almost indigestible From eating them the children grew pinched in limb and face while their abdomens bloated hugely Matanzas became peopled with a race of grotesquely misshapen little folks gnomes with young bodies but with faces old and sick Of course disease became epidemic for in the leaky hovels dirt floored and destitute of any convenience there could be no effort at sanitation Conditions became unspeakable The children died first then the aged and infirm Deaths in the street were not uncommon nearly every morning bodies were found beneath the portales Starving creatures crept to the market in the hope of begging a stray bit of food and some of them died there between the empty stalls The death wagons heavy with their daily freight rumbled ceaselessly through the streets adding to the giant piles of unburied corpses outside the city Typhoid smallpox yellow fever raged unchecked The hospitals were crowded and even in them the commonest necessities were lacking It is believed that men have returned from the grave but no one either Spaniard or Cuban had ever been known to return from one of these pest houses and in consequence those who were stricken preferred to remain and to die among their dear ones Yes Matanzas was pacified Weyler s boast was true Nowhere in the entire province was a field in cultivation nowhere outside the garrisoned towns was a house left standing Nor was the city of Matanzas the only concentration camp there were others dotted through Santa Clara Habana and Pinar del Rio In them half a million people cried for food Truly no rebellious land was ever more completely pacified than this no people s spirits ever more completely crushed Voices no longer preached resistance they prayed to Our Lady of Pity for a merciful conclusion of this misery Hands were upraised but only to implore In leaky huts from Jucaro to Cape San Antonio the dead lay huddled thickly Into Matanzas city of beggary and death came Rosa Varona and her two negro companions looking for relief They made the journey without mishap for they were too destitute to warrant plundering and Rosa s disguise concealed what charms remained to her But once they had entered the city what an awakening What suffering what poverty what rags they saw The three of them grew weak with dismay at the horror of it all but there was no retreat Asensio built a makeshift shelter close under La Cumbre from it the ruins of the Quinta de Esteban were visible and there they settled down to live They had hoped to lose themselves among the other prisoners and in this they were successful for none of their miserable neighbors were in any condition to notice them and there was nothing sufficiently conspicuous about two tattered blacks and their hunchbacked daughter to draw attention from the soldiers Asensio foraged zealously and at first he managed somehow to secure enough food for his little family He developed a real talent for discovering vegetables and fruits He stole he begged and he found food where there was none One day the soldiers seized him and put him to work on the fortifications along with a gang of other men who appeared strong enough to stand hard labor Asensio was not paid for this but he was allowed one meal a day and he succeeded in bringing home each night a share of his allotment It is surprising how little nourishment will sustain life Rosa and her two friends had long felt the pinch of hunger but now they plumbed new depths of privation for there were days when Asensio and his fellow conscripts received nothing at all After a time Evangelina began making baskets and weaving palm leaf hats which she sold at six cents each She taught Rosa the craft and they worked from dawn until dark striving with nimble tireless fingers to supplement Asensio s rations and postpone starvation But it was a hopeless task Other nimble fingers worked as tirelessly as theirs and the demand for hats was limited Their hut overlooked the road to San Severino that via dolorosa on which condemned prisoners were marched out to execution and in time the women learned to recognize the peculiar blaring notes of a certain cornet which signified that another Cuban cock was about to crow When in the damp of dewy mornings they heard that bugle they ceased their weaving long enough to cross themselves and whisper a prayer for the souls of those who were on their way to die But this was the only respite they allowed themselves Rosa meditated much upon the contrast between her present and her former condition Matanzas was the city of her birth and time was when she had trod its streets in arrogance and pride when she had possessed friends by the score among its residents But of all these there was not one to whom she dared appeal in this her hour of need These were harsh times Spanish hatred of the revolutionists was bitter and of the Cuban sympathizers none were left Moreover Esteban s denouncement as a traitor had estranged all who remained loyal to the crown and so far as Rosa herself was concerned she knew that it would not matter to them that she had cleaved to him merely from sisterly devotion by that act she had made herself a common enemy and they would scarcely sympathize with her plight The girl had learned only too well what spirit was abroad But even had she felt assured of meeting sympathy her pride was pure Castilian and it would never down She a Varona whose name was one to conjure with whose lineage was of the highest She to beg The thing was quite impossible One crumb so taken would have choked her Rosa preferred to suffer proudly and await the hour when hunger or disease would at last blot out her memories of happy days and end this nightmare misery Then too she dreaded any risk of discovery by old Mario de Castano who was a hard vindictive man His parting words had shown her that he would never forgive the slight she had put upon him and she did not wish to put his threats to the test Once Rosa saw him on her way to buy a few centavos worth of sweet potatoes he was huddled in his victoria a huge bladder of flesh and he rode the streets deaf to the plaints of starving children blind to the misery of beseeching mothers Rosa shrank into a doorway and drew her tattered shawl closer over her face for fear Don Mario might recognize in this misshapen body and in these pinched discolored features the beauteous blossom he had craved Nor did she forget Colonel Cobo The man s memory haunted her asleep and awake of him she was most desperately afraid When for the first time she saw him riding at the head of his cutthroats she was like to swoon in her tracks and for a whole day thereafter she cowered in the hut trembling at every sound In these dark hours she recalled the stories of the old Varona treasure and Esteban s interesting theory of its whereabouts but she could not bring herself to put much faith in either At the time of her brother s recital she had been swayed by his conviction but now on cooler thought a dozen explanations of Dona Isabel s possession of that doubloon offered themselves no one of which seemed less probable than Esteban s Of course it was barely possible that there was indeed a treasure and even that Esteban s surmise had been correct But it was little more than a remote possibility Distance lends a rosy color of reality to our most absurd imaginings but like the haze that tints a far off landscape it dissolves upon approach Now that Rosa was here in sight of the ruined quinta itself her hopes and half beliefs faded She wanted oh so desperately to believe in it but the grinding misery of her situation made it hard to do so Wonders like that came true only in fairy stories she told herself and certainly she had no cause to consider herself a favorite of fortune More than once she was tempted to confide in Evangelina and Asensio but she thought better of it Although she put implicit faith in Evangelina s discretion she knew that Asensio was not the sort of fellow to be trusted with a secret of great magnitude he was boastful talkative excitable he was just the sort to bring destruction upon all of them Rosa had sufficient intelligence to realize that even if she found her father s riches they would only constitute another and a greater menace to the lives of all of them Nevertheless she wished to set her mind at rest once and for all Taking Evangelina with her she climbed La Cumbre one day in search of roots and vegetables It turned out to be a sad experience for both women The negress wept noisily at the destruction wrought by Pancho Cueto and Rosa was overcome by painful memories Little that was familiar remained evidence of Cueto s all devouring greed spoke from the sprouting furrows his men had dug from the naked trees they had felled and piled in orderly heaps from the stones and mortar of the house itself Tears blinded Rosa After a time she left the black woman mourning among the ruins and stole away to the sunken garden Here the marks of vandalism were less noticeable Nevertheless few signs of beauty remained Neglected vines drooped spiritlessly from the ledges such fruit trees as had been spared were sickly and untended time and the elements had all but completed the disheartening work The well remained although it had been planked over but it was partially filled up with rubbish as Rosa discovered when she peered into it Only a tiny pool of scum was in the bottom After a long scrutiny the girl arose convinced at last of her brother s delusion and vaguely ashamed of her own credulity This was about the last repository that such a man as Don Esteban her father would have been likely to select for after all the most valuable part of his fortune had consisted of the deeds of title to the plantations No if ever there had been a treasure it was hidden elsewhere all of value that this well contained for Rosa was her memory of a happiness departed Of such memories the well the whole place was brimful Here as a child she had romped with Esteban Here as a girl she had dreamed her first dreams and here O Reilly her smiling knight had found her Yonder was the very spot where he had held her in his arms and begged her to await the day of his return Well she had waited But was that Rosa Varona who had promised so freely and so confidently this pitiful Rosa whose bones protruded through her rags It could not be Happiness contentment hope these were fictions only misery despair and pain were real But it had been a glorious dream at any rate a dream which Rosa vowed to cherish always Evangelina found the girl sitting in the sun her thin face
