Life and liberty while safe are little thought of for why they are matters of course Endangered they are rated at their real value In this too they are like sunshine whose beauty men notice not at noon when it is greatest but towards evening when it lies in flakes of topaz under shady elms Yet it is feebler then but gloom lies beside it and contrast reveals its fire Thus Gerard and Margaret though they started at every leaf that rustled louder than its fellows glowed all over with joy and thankfulness as they glided among the friendly trees in safety and deep tranquil silence baying dogs and brutal voices yet ringing in their mind s ears But presently Gerard found stains of blood on Margaret s ankles Martin Martin help they have wounded her the crossbow No no said Margaret smiling to reassure him I am not wounded nor hurt at all But what is it then in Heaven s name cried Gerard in great agitation Scold me not then and Margaret blushed Did I ever scold you No dear Gerard Well then Martin said it was blood those cruel dogs followed so I thought if I could but have a little blood on my shoon the dogs would follow me instead and let my Gerard wend free So I scratched my arm with Martin s knife forgive me Whose else could I take Yours Gerard Ah no You forgive me said she beseechingly and lovingly and fawningly all in one Let me see this scratch first said Gerard choking with emotion There I thought so A scratch I call it a cut a deep terrible cruel cut Gerard shuddered at sight of it She might have done it with her bodkin said the soldier Milksop that sickens at sight of a scratch and a little blood No no I could look on a sea of blood but not on hers Oh Margaret how could you be so cruel Margaret smiled with love ineffable Foolish Gerard murmured she to make so much of nothing And she flung the guilty arm round his neck As if I would not give all the blood in my heart for you let alone a few drops from my arm And with this under the sense of his recent danger she wept on his neck for pity and love and he wept with her And I must part from her he sobbed we two that love so dear one must be in Holland one in Italy Ah me ah me ah me At this Margaret wept afresh but patiently and silently Instinct is never off its guard and with her unselfishness was an instinct To utter her present thoughts would be to add to Gerard s misery at parting so she wept in silence Suddenly they emerged upon a beaten path and Martin stopped This is the bridle road I spoke of said he hanging his head and there away lies the hostelry Margaret and Gerard cast a scared look at one another Come a step with me Martin whispered Gerard When he had drawn him aside he said to him in a broken voice Good Martin watch over her for me She is my wife yet I leave her See Martin here is gold it was for my journey it is no use my asking her to take it she would not but you will for her will you not Oh Heaven and is this all I can do for her Money But poverty is a curse You will not let her want for anything dear Martin The burgomaster s silver is enough for me Thou art a good lad Gerard Neither want nor harm shall come to her I care more for her little finger than for all the world and were she nought to me even for thy sake would I be a father to her Go with a stout heart and God be with thee going and coming And the rough soldier wrung Gerard s hand and turned his head away with unwonted feeling After a moment s silence he was for going back to Margaret but Gerard stopped him No good Martin prithee stay here behind this thicket and turn your head away from us while I oh Martin Martin By this means Gerard escaped a witness of his anguish at leaving her he loved and Martin escaped a piteous sight He did not see the poor young things kneel and renew before Heaven those holy vows cruel men had interrupted He did not see them cling together like one and then try to part and fail and return to one another and cling again like drowning despairing creatures But he heard Gerard sob and sob and Margaret moan At last there was a hoarse cry and feet pattered on the hard road He started up and there was Gerard running wildly with both hands clasped above his head in prayer and Margaret tottering back towards him with palms extended piteously as if for help and ashy cheek and eyes fixed on vacancy He caught her in his arms and spoke words of comfort to her but her mind could not take them in only at the sound of his voice she moaned and held him tight and trembled violently He got her on the mule and put his arm around her and so supporting her frame which from being strong like a boy had now turned all relaxed and powerless he took her slowly and sadly home She did not shed one tear nor speak one word At the edge of the wood he took her off the mule and bade her go across to her father s house She did as she was bid Martin to Rotterdam Sevenbergen was too hot for him Gerard severed from her he loved went like one in a dream He hired a horse and a guide at the little hostelry and rode swiftly towards the German frontier But all was mechanical his senses felt blunted trees and houses and men moved by him like objects seen through a veil His companions spoke to him twice but he did not answer Only once he cried out savagely Shall we never be out of this hateful country After many hours riding they came to the brow of a steep hill a small brook ran at the bottom Halt cried the guide and pointed across the valley Here is Germany Where On t other side of the bourn No need to ride down the hill I trow Gerard dismounted without a word and took the burgomaster s purse from his girdle while he opened it You will soon be out of this hateful country said his guide half sulkily mayhap the one you are going to will like you no better any way though it be a church you have robbed they cannot take you once across that bourn These words at another time would have earned the speaker an admonition or a cuff They fell on Gerard now like idle air He paid the lad in silence and descended the hill alone The brook was silvery it ran murmuring over little pebbles that glittered varnished by the clear water he sat down and looked stupidly at them Then he drank of the brook then he laved his hot feet and hands in it it was very cold it waked him He rose and taking a run leaped across it into Germany Even as he touched the strange land he turned suddenly and looked back Farewell ungrateful country he cried But for her it would cost me nought to leave you for ever and all my kith and kin and the mother that bore me and my playmates and my little native town Farewell fatherland welcome the wide world omne so lum for ti p p at r a And with these brave words in his mouth he drooped suddenly with arms and legs all weak and sat down and sobbed bitterly upon the foreign soil When the young exile had sat a while bowed down he rose and dashed the tears from his eyes like a man and not casting a single glance more behind him to weaken his heart stepped out into the wide world His love and heavy sorrow left no room in him for vulgar misgivings Compared with rending himself from Margaret it seemed a small thing to go on foot to Italy in that rude age All nations meet in a convent So thanks to his good friends the monks and his own thirst of knowledge he could speak most of the languages needed on that long road He said to himself I will soon be at Rome the sooner the better now After walking a good league he came to a place where four ways met Being country roads and serpentine they had puzzled many an inexperienced neighbour passing from village to village Gerard took out a little dial Peter had given him and set it in the autumn sun and by this compass steered unhesitatingly for Rome inexperienced as a young swallow
