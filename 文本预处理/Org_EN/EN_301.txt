The next morning I was no sooner awake in my new lodging than I was up and into my new clothes and no sooner the breakfast swallowed than I was forth on my adventures Alan I could hope was fended for James was like to be a more difficult affair and I could not but think that enterprise might cost me dear even as everybody said to whom I had opened my opinion It seemed I was come to the top of the mountain only to cast myself down that I had clambered up through so many and hard trials to be rich to be recognised to wear city clothes and a sword to my side all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it and the worst kind of suicide besides which is to get hanged at the King s charges What was I doing it for I asked as I went down the High Street and out north by Leith Wynd First I said it was to save James Stewart and no doubt the memory of his distress and his wife s cries and a word or so I had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly At the same time I reflected that it was or ought to be the most indifferent matter to my father s [pg ]son whether James died in his bed or from a scaffold He was Alan s cousin to be sure but so far as regarded Alan the best thing would be to lie low and let the King and his Grace of Argyll and the corbie crows pick the bones of his kinsman their own way Nor could I forget that while we were all in the pot together James had shown no such particular anxiety whether for Alan or me Next it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice and I thought that a fine word and reasoned it out that since we dwelt in polities at some discomfort to each one of us the main thing of all must still be justice and the death of any innocent man a wound upon the whole community Next again it was the Accuser of the Brethren that gave me a turn of his argument bid me think shame for pretending myself concerned in these high matters and told me I was but a prating vain child who had spoken big words to Rankeillor and to Stewart and held myself bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness Nay and he hit me with the other end of the stick for he accused me of a kind of artful cowardice going about at the expense of a little risk to purchase greater safety No doubt until I had declared and cleared myself I might any day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff s officer and be recognised and dragged into the Appin murder by the heels and no doubt in case I could manage my declaration with success I should breathe more free for [pg ]ever after But when I looked this argument full in the face I could see nothing to be ashamed of As for the rest Here are the two roads I thought and both go to the same place It s unjust that James should hang if I can save him and it would be ridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do nothing It s lucky for James of the Glens that I have boasted beforehand and none so unlucky for myself because now I m committed to do right I have the name of a gentleman and the means of one it would be a poor discovery that I was wanting in the essence And then I thought this was a Pagan spirit and said a prayer in to myself asking for what courage I might lack and that I might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle and come off again scatheless as so many do This train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion though it was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that surrounded me nor of how very apt I was if I went on to stumble on the ladder of the gallows It was a plain fair morning but the wind in the east The little chill of it sang in my blood and gave me a feeling of the autumn and the dead leaves and dead folks bodies in their graves It seemed the devil was in it if I was to die in that tide of my fortunes and for other folks affairs On the top of the Calton Hill though it was not the customary time of year for that diversion some children were crying and running with their kites These toys appeared very plain against the [pg ]sky I remarked a great one soar on the wind to a high altitude and then plump among the whins and I thought to myself at sight of it There goes Davie My way lay over Mouter s Hill and through an end of a clachan on the braeside among fields There was a whirr of looms in it went from house to house bees bummed in the gardens the neighbours that I saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue and I found out later that this was Picardy a village where the French weavers wrought for the Linen Company Here I got a fresh direction for Pilrig my destination and a little beyond on the wayside came by a gibbet and two men hanged in chains They were dipped in tar as the manner is the wind span them the chains clattered and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping jacks and cried The sight coming on me suddenly like an illustration of my fears I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort And as I thus turned and turned about the gibbet what should I strike on but a weird old wife that sat behind a leg of it and nodded and talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies Who are these two mother I asked and pointed to the corpses A blessing on your precious face she cried Twa joes[ ] o mine just twa o my old joes my hinny dear What did they suffer for I asked Ou just for the guid cause said she Aften I spaed to them the way that it would end Twa shillin Scots no pickle mair and there are twa bonny callants hingin for t They took it frae a wean[ ] belanged to Brouchton Ay said I to myself and not to the daft limmer and did they come to such a figure for so poor a business This is to lose all indeed Gie s your loof [ ] hinny says she and let me spae your weird to ye No mother said I I see far enough the way I am It s an unco thing to see too far in front I read it in your bree she said There s a bonnie lassie that has bricht een and there s a wee man in a braw coat and a big man in a pouthered wig and there s the shadow of the wuddy [ ] joe that lies braid across your path Gie s your loof hinny and let Auld Merren spae it to ye bonny The two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan and the daughter of James More struck me hard and I fled from the eldritch creature casting her a baubee which she continued to sit and play with under the moving shadows of the hanged My way down the causeway of Leith Walk would have been more pleasant to me but for this encounter The old rampart ran among fields the like of them [pg ]I had never seen for artfulness of agriculture I was pleased besides to be so far in the still countryside but the shackles of the gibbet clattered in my head and the mops and mows of the old witch and the thought of the dead men hag rode my spirits To hang on a gallows that seemed a hard case and whether a man came to hang there for two shillings Scots or as Mr Stewart had it from the sense of duty once he was tarred and shackled and hung up the difference seemed small There might David Balfour hang and other lads pass on their errands and think light of him and old daft limmers sit at leg foot and spae their fortunes and the clean genty maids go by and look to the other side and hold a nose I saw them plain and they had grey eyes and their screens upon their heads were of the Drummond colours I was thus in the poorest of spirits though still pretty resolved when I came in view of Pilrig a pleasant gabled house set by the walkside among some brave young woods The laird s horse was standing saddled at the door as I came up but himself was in the study where he received me in the midst of learned works and musical instruments for he was not only a deep philosopher but much of a musician He greeted me at first pretty well and when he had read Rankeillor s letter placed himself obligingly at my disposal And what is it cousin David says he since it appears that we are cousins what is this that I can [pg ]do for you A word to Prestongrange Doubtless that is easily given But what should be the word Mr Balfour said I if I were to tell you my whole story the way it fell out it s my opinion and it was Rankeillor s before me that you would be very little made up with it I am sorry to hear this of you kinsman says he I must not take that at your hands Mr Balfour said I I have nothing to my charge to make me sorry or you for me but just the common infirmities of mankind The guilt of Adam s first sin the want of original righteousness and the corruption of my whole nature so much I must answer for and I hope I have been taught where to look for help I said for I judged from the look of the man he would think the better of me if I knew my questions [ ] But in the way of worldly honour I have no great stumble to reproach myself with and my difficulties have befallen me very much against my will and by all that I can see without my fault My trouble is to have become dipped in a political complication which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge of Why very well Mr David he replied I am pleased to see you are all that Rankeillor represented And for what you say of political complications you do me no more than justice It is my study to be beyond suspicion and indeed outside the field of it The [pg ]question is says he how if I am to know nothing of the matter I can very well assist you Why sir said I I propose you should write to his lordship that I am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means both of which I believe to be the case I have Rankeillor s word for it said Mr Balfour and I count that a warrandice against all deadly To which you might add if you will take my word for so much that I am a good churchman loyal to King George and so brought up I went on None of which will do you any harm said Mr Balfour Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a matter of great moment connected with His Majesty s service and the administration of justice I suggested As I am not to hear the matter says the laird I will not take upon myself to qualify its weight Great moment therefore falls and moment along with it For the rest I might express myself much as you propose And then sir said I and rubbed my neck a little with my thumb then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my protection Protection says he For your protection Here is a phrase that somewhat dampens me If the [pg ]matter be so dangerous I own I would be a little loath to move in it blindfold I believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks said I Perhaps that would be the best said he Well it s the Appin murder said I He held up both the hands Sirs sirs cried he I thought by the expression of his face and voice that I had lost my helper Let me explain I began I thank you kindly I will hear no more of it says he I decline in toto to hear more of it For your name s sake and Rankeillor s and perhaps a little for your own I will do what I can to help you but I will hear no more upon the facts And it is my first clear duty to warn you These are deep waters Mr David and you are a young man Be cautious and think twice It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that Mr Balfour said I and I will direct your attention again to Rankeillor s letter where I hope and believe he has registered his approval of that which I design Well well said he and then again Well well I will do what I can for you Therewith he took a pen and paper sat awhile in thought and began to write with much consideration I understand that [pg ]Rankeillor approves of what you have in mind he asked presently After some discussion sir he bade me to go forward in God s name said I That is the name to go in said Mr Balfour and resumed his writing Presently he signed re read what he had written and addressed me again Now here Mr David said he is a letter of introduction which I will seal without closing and give into your hands open as the form requires But since I am acting in the dark I will just read it to you so that you may see if it will secure your end PILRIG August th MY LORD This is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin David Balfour Esquire of Shaws a young
