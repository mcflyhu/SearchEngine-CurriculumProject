When it comes it may come all at once the surgeon had said and overwhelm him Better lead up to it if we can let him recall it a bit here a bit there feel his way back to the old place to himself Where my child is said Philip Harris Where your child is repeated the surgeon and that clue runs through the frailest intangiblest matter that fingers ever touched He had looked down at his own thin long firm fingers as if doubting that they could have held that thread for a moment and left it intact Philip Harris moved restively a little and came back There has not been a word for seven weeks he said not a breath They told you said the surgeon That they would wait three months Yes Philip Harris puffed fiercely It is hell he said The boy is better said the surgeon You have only to wait a little longer now And he was whirred away in the great car to the children that needed him and Idlewood had settled in its charmed stillness into the night No one would have guessed that it was a state of siege there the world passed in and out of the big gates automobiles and drays and foot passengers winding their way up to the low rambling house that wandered through the flowers toward the river and the wood Windows were open everywhere and voices sounded through the garden In one of the rooms darkened to the light the mistress of the house lay with closed eyes She could not bear the light or the sound of voices listening always to hear a child s laugh among them the gay little laugh that ran toward her in every room and called She had shut herself away and only Philip Harris came to the closed room bringing her news of the search or sitting quietly by her in the darkness But for weeks there had been no news no clue The search was baffled They had not told her of the Greek boy and the muttered words Better not trouble her the physician had urged She cannot bear disappointment if nothing comes of it And no word filtered through to the dim room and all the clues withdrew in darkness Out in the garden Alcibiades and Miss Stone worked among the flowers It was part of the cure that they should work there among growing things every day close to the earth and his voice sounded happily as they worked The woman in the closed room turned her head uneasily She listened a moment Then she called Marie stood in the doorway Who is there Marie in the garden The maid stole to the window and peered through the shutters She came back to the bed It s a boy she said a Greek boy and Miss Stone Why is he here asked the woman querulously The maid paused discreet She knew everyone except the woman lying with closed eyes knew why the boy was here She bent and adjusted the pillow smoothing it He is someone Mr Harris sent down she said someone to get well There was no reply The woman lay quiet I want to get up Marie she said at last It is stifling here Yes Madame The windows were opened a little the light came in slowly and Mrs Philip Harris stepped at last into the loggia that led from her windows out toward the garden Grapevines climbed the posts and tendril shadows were on the ground beneath They rested on the frail figure moving under them toward the light Marie hovered near her with pillows and a sunshade and her face full of care But the woman waved her back I do not need you Marie Here I will take the sunshade Now go back She moved on slowly The voices had died away In the distance she saw Miss Stone moving toward the wood alone She paused for a moment watching the grey figure a little cloud passed across her face She had not seen Miss Stone since she did not blame her but she could not see her She moved on slowly the light from the sunshade touching the lines in her face and flushing them softly Suddenly she stopped On a low couch a little distance away a boy lay asleep She came up to him softly and stood watching him There was something in the flushed face in the childish drooping lip and tossed hair that reminded her Slowly she sank down beside him hardly breathing All about them the summer went on the quiet gentle warmth and the fresh scent of blossoms The boy murmured a little and threw out an arm and slept on The woman s eyes watched the sleeping face Something mysterious was in it a look of other worlds It was the look of Betty at night when she lay asleep It certainly was from some other world The woman bent forward a little The dark eyes opened and looked at her and smiled The boy sat up I sleep he said He rubbed his eyes boyishly smiling still to her I very sleepy he said I work He rubbed his arms I work hard She questioned him and moved a little away and he came and sat at her feet telling her of himself with quiet slowness As she questioned him he told her all that he knew And they chatted in the sunshine subtly drawn to each other happy in something they could not have said The boy had grown refined by his illness the sturdy hands that had guided the push cart had lost their roughened look and seemed the shape of some old statue and the head poised on the round throat was as if some old museum had come to life and laughed in the sun If Mrs Philip Harris had seen Alcibiades shoving his cart before him along the cobbled street his head thrown back his voice calling Ban an nas as he went she would not have given him a thought But here in her garden in the white clothes that he wore and sitting at her feet it was as if the gates to another world had opened to them and both looked back together at his own life The mystery in the boy s eyes stirred her and the sound of his voice there was something in it beauty wonder mystery She drew a quick breath I think I will go in she said and the boy lifted himself to help her and only left her under the loggia with a quick grateful flash of the dark smile Mrs Philip Harris slept that night the chloral on the little table beside her untouched And the next day found her in the garden All the household watched with quickened hope The mistress of the house had taken up her life and the old quick orders ran through the house And no one spoke of the child It was as if she were asleep in some distant room veiled in her cloud But the house came back to its life Only the social groups that had filled it every summer were not there But there was the Greek boy in the garden and Miss Stone and Philip Harris whirring out at night and sitting on the terrace in the dusk the light of his cigar glimmering a little as he watched the Greek boy flung on the ground at his feet his eyes playing with the stars He knew them all by name under the skies of Greece Achilles had taught them to him and he counted them like a flock as he lay on the terrace rolling out the great Greek names while they girdled the sky above him in a kind of homely chant When the boy had gone to bed Philip Harris remained smoking thoughtfully and looking still at the stars He had had a long talk with the surgeon to day and he had given his consent The boy was well he admitted as well as he was likely to be perhaps Give him three more days then if nothing happened they might question him Philip Harris threw away his cigar and its glimmering light went out in the grass Overhead the great
