It seemed to Henrietta Hen that the time for the fair would never come She had begun to feel somewhat uneasy because she had talked so much about visiting the fair with her children that it would be very awkward if she didn t go So she was delighted one day by the noise of hammering and sawing that came from the workbench at the end of the wagon shed A merry noise it was to Henrietta s ears for she guessed at once what was happening Farmer Green and his son were building a pen in which she and her family were to ride to the fair The news spread like fire in sun dried grass Henrietta Hen took pains that it should She told everybody she saw that she expected to leave at any moment And she began to say good by to all her friends Since Henrietta didn t start for the fair that day before nightfall she had bade every one farewell at least a dozen times And when the following dawn Henrietta started the day not by saying Good morning but by bidding her neighbors Good by once more they began to think her a bit tiresome What Haven t you gone yet they asked her No But I expect to leave at any moment Henrietta told them She was so excited that she couldn t eat her breakfast But her chicks had no such trouble And perhaps it was just as well that Henrietta Hen had her hands full looking after them and trying to keep them all under her eye and spick and span for the journey Otherwise she would have been in more of a flutter than she was While Henrietta had an eye on her children she tried to keep the other on the barn And after what seemed to her hours of watching and waiting she saw Johnnie Green lead the old horse Ebenezer out of the door with his harness on Henrietta promptly forgot her stately manners She ran squalling across the farmyard and called to Ebenezer Where are you going I understand that I m going to the fair he told her as Johnnie Green backed him between the thills of a wagon Once I would have been hitched to a light buggy with a sulky tied behind it But now I ve got to take you and your family in this rattlety old contraption Henrietta Hen didn t wait to hear any more She turned and hurried back to gather her youngsters and bid everybody another farewell Amid a great clucking and squawking Johnnie Green and his father put Henrietta and her chicks into the pen and placed it in the back of the wagon We re all ready Henrietta cried to Ebenezer The old horse didn t even turn his head for he could see backwards as well as forwards because he wore no blinders He made no direct reply to Henrietta though he gave a sort of grunt as if the whole affair did not please him He knew that it was a long distance to the fairgrounds and the road was hilly She thinks it a lark he said to the dog Spot who hung about as if he were waiting for something She s lucky for she won t have to go on her own legs for miles and miles That s just what I intend to do Spot informed him They don t mean to take me But I m going to follow you right under the wagon where Johnnie Green and his father can t see me So they started off And they had scarcely passed through the gate when Henrietta began to clamor in her shrillest tones But nobody paid any heed to her The wagon clattered off down the road And old dog Spot smiled to himself as he trotted along beneath it Henrietta just remembered that she forgot to put on her best apron he chuckled wagon n We have to fork the hay into the wagon The muddy road bemired the wagon tiresome adj His doubts and hesitations were tiresome He was tiresome in contending for the value of his own labors promptly adv He paid the money back promptly She promptly seized the opportunity his absence gave her hitched hitch They hitched a ride in a truck We hitched a ride in a truck yesterday backwards adv He turned on the light and began to pace backwards and forwards All the girls fell over backwards to get the party ready grunt v n He lifted the heavy suitcase with a grunt I ask him what he think but he just grunt heed v n You must take heed of what he has told For the first time he had to pay heed to his appearance clattered clatter He dropped the knife and it clattered on the stone floor His hand went limp and the knife clattered to the ground trotted trot She trotted her pony around the field Anne trotted obediently beside her mother chuckled chuckle She chuckled at the memory She chuckled softly to herself as she remembered his astonished look
