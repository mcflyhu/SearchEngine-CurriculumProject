About six o clock James Canterton took leave of Guinevere and passing out through the yew hedge made his way down the rhododendron walk to the wicket gate that opened on the side of a hill On this hill side was the heath garden that tumbled when in full bloom like a cataract of purple and white wine till it broke against the shadowy edge of a larch wood The spires of the larches descended in glimmering confusion towards the stream that ran among poplars and willows in the bottom of the valley Canterton followed a path that led into the larch wood where the thousands of grey black poles were packed so close together that the eye could not see for more than thirty yards There was a faint and mysterious murmuring in the tree tops a sound as of breathing that was only to be heard when one stood still The ground was covered with thin wiry grass of a peculiarly vivid green The path curled this way and that among the larch trunks with a ribbon of blue sky mimicking it overhead The wood was called the wilderness and even when a gale was blowing it was calm and sheltered in the deeps among the trees Canterton paused now and again to examine some of the larches He had been working at the spruce gall aphis disease trying to discover a new method of combating it or of lighting upon some other creature that by preying upon the pest might be encouraged to extirpate the disease The winding path led him at last to the lip of a large dell or sunken clearing It was a pool of yellow sunlight in the midst of the green glooms palisaded round with larch trunks its banks a tangle of broom heather bracken whortleberry and furze There was a boggy spot in one corner where gorgeous mosses made a carpet of green and gold and bog asphodel grew and the sundew fed upon insects All about the clearing the woods were a blue mist when the wild hyacinth bloomed in May Down below him in a grassy hollow a child with brilliant auburn hair was feeding a fire with dry sticks She knelt intent and busy serenely alone with herself tending the fire that she had made Beside her she had a tin full of water an old saucepan two or three potatoes some tea and sugar twisted up together in the corner of a newspaper and a medicine bottle half full of milk Hallo hallo The auburn hair flashed in the sunlight and the child turned the face of a beautiful and wayward elf Daddy She sprang up and raced towards him Daddy come along I ve got to cook the supper for the fairies Canterton had never evolved a more beautiful flower than this child of his Lynette She was his in every way without a shred of her mother s nature for even her glowing little head was as different from Gertrude Canterton s as fire from clay Hallo come along He caught her up with his big hands and set her on his shoulder Now then what about Princess Puck You don t mean to say the greedy little beggars have eaten up all that pudding we cooked them last night Every little bit It must have been good And it means that we shall have to put on our aprons On the short grass at the bottom of the clearing was a fairy ring and to Lynette the whole wilderness was full of the little people The dell was her playing ground and she fled to it on those happy occasions when Miss Vance her governess had her hours of freedom As for Canterton he was just the child that she was entering into all her fancies applauding them and taking a delight in her gay elf like enthusiasm Have you seen Brer Rabbit to night No He just said How de do to me as I came through the wood And I saw old Sergeant Hedgehog taking a nap under a tuft of grass I don t like old Hedgehog I don t like prickly people do you daddy Not much Like Miss Nickleton She might be a pin cushion She s always taking out pins and putting you all tidy Now then we ve got to be very serious What s the supper to be to night Baked potatoes and tea By Jove they ll get fat Canterton set her down and threw himself into the business with an immense seriousness that made him the most convincing of playfellows He took off his coat rolled up his shirt sleeves and looked critically at the fire We want some more wood daddy Just so He went among the larches gathered an armful of dead wood and returned to the fire Lynette was kneeling and poking it with a stick her hair shining in the sunlight her pale face with its hazel eyes full of a happy seriousness Canterton knelt down beside her and they began to feed the fire Rather sulky Blow daddy He bent down and played olus getting red in the face I say what a lot of work these fairies give us But won t they be pleased I like to think of them coming out in the moonlight and feasting and then having their dance round the ring And singing Long live Lynette They heated up the water in the saucepan and made tea of a kind and baked the potatoes in the embers of the fire Lynette always spread the feast on the bottom of a bank near the fairy ring Sergeant Hedgehog black eyed field mice and an occasional rat disposed of the food but that did not matter so long as Lynette found that it had gone Canterton himself would come down early and empty the tea away to keep up the illusion I think I ll be a fairy some night Lynette Her eyes laughed up at him Fancy you being a fairy daddy Why you d eat up all the food and there wouldn t be room to dance Come now I m hurt She stroked his face You re so much better than a fairy daddy The sun slanted lower and shadows began to cover the clearing Canterton smothered the fire picked up Lynette and set her on his shoulders one black leg hanging down on either side of his cerise tie for Canterton always wore Irish tweeds and ties that showed some colour Off we go They romped through the larch wood up the hill side and into the garden Lynette s two hands clasped over her father s forehead Fernhill House showed up against the evening sky a warm old red brick building with white window frames roses and creepers covering it and little dormer windows peeping out of the tiled roof Stretches of fine turf were unfurled before it set with beds of violas and bounded by great herbaceous borders A cedar of Lebanon grew to the east a noble sequoia to the west throwing sharp black shadows on the gold green grass Gallop daddy Canterton galloped and her brilliant hair danced and her red mouth laughed They came across the grass to the house in fine uproarious style and were greeted by the sound of voices drifting through the open windows of the drawing room Their irresponsible fun was at end Canterton set the child down just as the thin primrose coloured figure came to one of the open French windows James Mrs Brocklebank has come back with me Where is Miss Vance Lynette replied for Miss Vance She had a headache mother I might have inferred something of the kind Look at the front of your dress Lynette Yes mother What have you been doing And you have got a great hole in your left stocking over the knee Yes mother so I have Lynette how often have I told you Mrs Brocklebank or no Mrs Brocklebank Canterton interposed quietly in Lynette s defence If it s anybody s fault it s mine Gertrude Let the child be a child sometimes She turned on him impatiently being only too conscious of the fact that Lynette was his child and not hers How can you expect me to have any authority And in the end the responsibility always rests with the woman Perhaps perhaps not Run along old lady I ll come and say good night presently Lynette walked off to the south door having no desire to be kissed by Mrs Brocklebank in the drawing room She turned and looked back once at her father with a demure yet inimitable twinkle of the eyes Canterton was very much part of Lynette s life Her mother only dashed into it with spasmodic earnestness and with eyes that were fussily critical For though Gertrude Canterton always spoke of woman s place being the home she was so much busied with reforming other people s homes and setting all their social machinery in order that she had very little leisure left for her own A housekeeper managed the house by letting Mrs Canterton think that she herself managed it Miss Vance was almost wholly responsible for Lynette and Gertrude Canterton s periodic plunges into the domestic routine at Fernhill were like the surprise visits of an inspector of schools Mrs Brocklebank is staying the night We have some business to discuss with regard to the Children s Home Canterton detested Mrs Brocklebank but he went in and shook hands with her She was a large woman with the look of a very serious minded white cow Her great point was her gravity It was a massive and imposing edifice which you could walk round and inspect without being able to get inside it This building was fitted with a big clock that boomed solemnly at regular intervals always making the same sound and making it as though it were uttering some new and striking note I see you are one of those Mr Canterton who like to let children run wild I suppose I am I d rather my child had fine legs and a good appetite to begin with His wife joined in Lynette could not read when she was six That was a gross crime Gertrude to be sure It might be called symptomatic Mrs Brocklebank my wife is too conscientious for some of us Can one be too conscientious Mr Canterton Well I can never imagine Gertrude with holes in her stockings or playing at honey pots I believe you wrote a prize essay when you were eleven Gertrude and the subject was How to teach children to play in earnest If you ll excuse me I have to see Lavender about one of the hothouses before I dress for dinner He left them together sitting like two solemn china figures nodding their heads over his irresponsible love of laissez faire Mrs Brocklebank had no children but she was a great authority upon them in a kind of pathological way I think you ought to make a stand Gertrude The trouble is my husband s ideas run the same way as the child s inclinations I think I must get rid of Miss Vance She is too easygoing The child ought soon to be old enough to go to school Let me see how old is she Seven Send her away next year There is that very excellent school at Cheltenham managed by Miss Sandys She was a wrangler you know and is an LL D Her ideas are absolutely sound Psychological discipline is one of her great points I must speak to James about it He is such a difficult man to deal with So immovable and always turning things into a kind of quiet laughter I know Most difficult most baffling Though three people sat down at the dinner table it was a diner deux so far as the conversation was concerned The women discussed the Primrose League F te and Lord Parallax whom Gertrude Canterton had found rather disappointing From mere local topics they travelled into the wilderness of eugenics Mrs Brocklebank treating of Mendelism and talking as though Canterton had never heard of Mendel It amused him to listen to her especially since the work of such master men as Mendel and De Vries formed part of the intimate inspiration of his own study of the strange beauty of growth Mrs Brocklebank appeared to have muddled up Mendelism with Galton s theory of averages She talked sententiously of pure dominants and recessives got her figures badly mixed and uttered some really astonishing things that would have thrilled a scientific audience Yet it was dreary stuff when devitalised by Mrs Brocklebank s pompous inexactitudes especially when accompanied by an interminable cracking of nuts She always ended lunch and dinner with nuts munching them slowly and solemnly exaggerating her own resemblance to a white cow chewing the cud Canterton escaped upstairs passed Miss Vance on the landing a motherly young woman with rich brown hair and made his way to the nursery The room was full of the twilight and through the open window came the last notes of a thrush Lynette was lying in a white bed with a green coverlet Her mother had ordered a pink bedspread but Miss Vance had thought of Lynette s hair Canterton sat on the edge of the bed Well Princess are you a pure dominant I ve said my prayers daddy Oh that s good very good I wonder how the feast is getting on in the Wilderness They won t come out yet not till the moon shines Think of their little silver slippers twinkling like dewdrops on the grass I wish I could see them daddy Have you ever seen a fairy I think I ve caught a glimpse of one now and again But you have to be ever so good to see fairies You ought to have seen lots then daddy He laughed the quiet meditative laugh of the man wise in his own humility There are more wonderful things than fairies Lynette I ll tell you about them some day Yes do She sat up in bed her hair a dark flowing mass about her slim face and throat and Canterton was reminded of some exquisite white bud that promised to be an exquisite flower Let s have some rhymes daddy What more Bed Ballads Yes What shall we start with Begin with cat All right let s see what turns up Outside the door there lay a cat Aunt Emma thought it was a mat And though poor Puss was rather fat Aunt Emma left her simply flat Oh poor Pussy Rather too realistic for you and too hard on the cat Make up something about Mister Bruin Bruin That s a stiff thing to rhyme to Let s see Now Mister Bruin Went a wooin The lady said What are you doin I m stumped I can t get any farther Oh yes you can daddy Very well Let s call him Mr Bear instead And say his mouth was very red Miss Bruin had a Paris gown on She was a sweet phenomenownon The gloves she wore were just nineteens Of course you know what that size means Mr Bear wore thirty ones But then he was so fond of buns He asked Miss B to be his wife And said I will lay down my life She answered him Now how much money Can you afford and how much honey Poor B looked rather brown at that For he was not a plutocrat My dear he said it makes me sore That I should be so very poor I ll start a bun shop if you like And buy you a new motor bike She said I know where all the buns would go And motor biking s much too low Poor Teddy flew off in disgust Saying Marry a Marquis if you must Lynette clapped her hands What a horrid Miss Bruin I hope she died an old maid No she married Lord Grizzley And he gave her twopence a week to dress on and made her give him her fur to stuff his bath chair cushions with How splendid That s just what ought to have happened daddy When he had kissed her good night and seen her snuggle down with her hair spread out over the pillow Canterton went down to the library and in passing the door of the drawing room heard Mrs Brocklebank s voice sending out its slow complacent notes This woman always had a curious psychical effect on him She smeared all the fine outlines of life and brought an unpleasant odour into the house that penetrated everywhere What was more she had the effect of making him look at his wife with that merciless candour that discovers every crudity and every trifle that is unlovely Gertrude was a most excellent woman He saw her high forehead her hat tilted at the wrong angle her hair straggling in wisps her finnicking vivacity her thin wriggling shoulders the way she mouthed her words and poked her chin forward when she talked The clarity of his vision often shocked him especially when he tried to remember her as a slim and rather over enthusiastic girl Had they both changed so vastly and why He knew that his wife had become subtly repulsive to him not in the mere gross physical sense alone but in her mental odour They ate together but slept apart He never entered her room The idea of touching her provoked some fastidious instinct within him and made him shrink from the imagined contact Sometimes he wondered whether Gertrude was aware of this strong and incipient repulsion He imagined that she felt nothing He had not lived with her for fifteen years without discovering how thick was the skin of her restless egotism Canterton had never known anyone who was so completely and actively self satisfied He never remembered having seen her in tears As for their estrangement it had come about gradually when he had chosen to change the life of the amateur for the life of the trader Then there was the child another gulf between them A tacit yet silent antagonism had grown up round Lynette On Canterton s desk in the library lay the manuscript of his Book of the English Garden He had been at work on it for two years trying to get all the mystery and colour and beauty of growth into the words he used He sat down at the desk and turned over the pages written in that strong regular and unhurried hand of his The manuscript smelt of lavender for he always kept a few sprigs between the leaves But to night something seemed lacking in the book It was too much a thing of black and white The words did not strike upon his brain and evoke a glow of living colour Roses were not red enough and the torch lily had not a sufficient flame Colour yes colour He sat back and lit his pipe I must get someone to start the plates I know just what I want but I don t quite know the person to do it He talked to himself within himself Rogers No too flamboyant not true I want truth There s Peterson No I don t like Peterson s style too niggling Loses the charm in trying to be too correct He was disturbed by the opening of a door and a sudden swelling of voices towards him He half turned in his chair with the momentary impatience of a thinker disturbed Let us look it up under hygiene The library door opened and the invasion displayed itself We want to look at the encyclop dia James It s there I always feel so stimulated when I am in a library Mr Canterton I hope you don t mind our Oh not in the least I think we might make our notes here Gertrude Gertrude Canterton was standing by a revolving book stand looking out the volume they needed Yes James you might get us the other light and put it on the table He got up fetched the portable red shaded lamp from a book stand set it on the oak table in the centre of the room and turned on the switch Oh and the ink and a pen Not one of your nibs I can t bear J s Something thinner Please Oh and some paper Some of that manuscript paper will do They established themselves at the table Mrs Brocklebank with the volume Gertrude with the pen and paper Mrs Brocklebank brought out her pince nez adjusted them half down her nose and began to turn over the pages Canterton took a book on moths from a shelf and sat down in an easy chair Hum Hygiene I find it here public health sanitary by laws hum hum sewage systems I think we shall discover what we want Ah here it is The matron told me Yes exactly They had to burn pastilles Hum hum septic tank My dear what is a septic tank Something not quite as it should be Ah exactly I understand Hum let me see Their tank must be very septic That accounts for hum for the odour Canterton watched them over the top of his book He could see his wife s face plainly She was frowning and biting the end of the pen and fidgeting with the paper He noticed the yellow tinge of the skin and the eager and almost hungry shadow lines that ran from her nose to the corners of her mouth It was a passionless face angular and restless utterly lacking in any inward imaginative glow Gertrude Canterton rushed at life fiddled at the notes with her thin fingers but had no subtle understanding of the meaning of the sounds that were produced Mrs Brocklebank read like a grave cleric at a lectern head tilted slightly back her eyes looking down through her pince nez The bacterial action should produce an effluent that is perfectly clear and odourless My dear I think hum that there is a misconception somewhere Neither of them noticed that Canterton had left them and had disappeared through the French window into the garden A full moon had risen and in one of the shrubberies a nightingale was singing The cedar of Lebanon and the great sequoia were black and mysterious and very still the lawns a soft silver dusted ever so lightly with dew Not a leaf was stirring and the pale night stood like a sweet sad ghost looking down on the world with eyes of wisdom and of wonder Canterton strolled across the grass and down through the Japanese garden where lilies floated in the still pools that reflected the moonlight All the shadows were very sharp and black the cypresses standing like obelisks the yew hedge of the rosery a wall of obsidian Canterton wandered up and down the stone paths of the rosery and knocked his pipe out in order to smell the faint perfumes that lingered in the still air He had lived so much among flowers that his sense of smell had become extraordinarily sensitive and he could distinguish many a rose in the dark by means of its perfume The full moon stared at him over the yew hedge huge and yellow in a cloudless sky and Canterton thought of Lynette s fairies down in the Wilderness tripping round the fairy ring on the dewy grass The sense of an increasing loneliness forced itself upon him as he walked up and down the paths of the rosery For of late he had come to know that he was lonely in spite of Lynette in spite of all his fascinating problems in spite of his love of life and of growth That was just it He loved the colours the scents and the miraculous complexities of life so strongly that he wanted someone to share this love someone who understood someone who possessed both awe and curiosity Lynette was very dear to him dearer than anything else on earth but she was the child and doubtless he would lose her when she became the woman He supposed that some day she would marry and the thought of it almost shocked him Good God what a lottery it was He might have to hand her over to some raw boy and if life proved unkind to her Well after all it was Nature And how did marriages come about How had his own come about What on earth had made him marry Gertrude What on earth made most men marry most women He had been shy rather diffident a big fellow in earnest and he remembered how Gertrude had made a little hero of him because of his travels Yes he supposed it had been suggestion Every woman the lure of the feminine thing a dim notion that they would be fellow enthusiasts and that the woman was what he had imagined woman to be Canterton smiled to himself but the pathetic humour of life did not make him feel any less lonely He wanted someone who would walk with him on such a night as this someone to whom it was not necessary to say trite things someone to whom a touch of the hand would be eloquent someone who had his patient watchful wonder obsessed soul He was not spending half of himself because he could not pour out one half
