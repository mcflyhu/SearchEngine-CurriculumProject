But how are we to get it to our mouths inquired the senior despondingly Father the young man has brought us straws And Margaret smiled slily Ay ay said the old man but my poor bones are stiff and indeed the fire is too hot for a body to kneel over with these short straws St John the Baptist but the young man is adroit For while he stated his difficulty Gerard removed it He untied in a moment the knot on his breast took his hat off put a stone into each corner of it then wrapping his hand in the tail of his jerkin whipped the flask off the fire wedged it in between the stones and put the hat under the old man s nose with a merry smile The other tremulously inserted the pipe of rye straw and sucked Lo and behold his wan drawn face was seen to light up more and more till it quite glowed and as soon as he had drawn a long breath Hippocrates and Galen he cried tis a soupe au vin the restorative of restoratives Blessed be the nation that invented it and the woman that made it and the young man who brings it to fainting folk Have a suck my girl while I relate to our young host the history and virtues of this his sovereign compound This corroborative young sir was unknown to the ancients we find it neither in their treatises of medicine nor in those popular narratives which reveal many of their remedies both in chirurgery and medicine proper Hector in the Ilias if my memory does not play me false Margaret Alas he s off was invited by one of the ladies of the poem to drink a draught of wine but he declined on the plea that he was just going into battle and must not take aught to weaken his powers Now if the soupe au vin had been known in Troy it is clear that in declining vinum merum upon that score he would have added in the hexameter But a soupe au vin madam I will degust and gratefully Not only would this have been but common civility a virtue no perfect commander is wanting in but not to have done it would have proved him a shallow and improvident person unfit to be trusted with the conduct of a war for men going into a battle need sustenance and all possible support as is proved by this that foolish generals bringing hungry soldiers to blows with full ones have been defeated in all ages by inferior numbers The Romans lost a great battle in the north of Italy to Hannibal the Carthaginian by this neglect alone Now this divine elixir gives in one moment force to the limbs and ardour to the spirits and taken into Hector s body at the nick of time would by the aid of Phoebus Venus and the blessed saints have most likely procured the Greeks a defeat For note how faint and weary and heart sick I was a minute ago well I suck this celestial cordial and now behold me brave as Achilles and strong as an eagle Oh father now an eagle alack Girl I defy thee and all the world Ready I say like a foaming charger to devour the space between this and Rotterdam and strong to combat the ills of life even poverty and old age which last philosophers have called the summum malum Negatur unless the man s life has been ill spent which by the bye it generally has Now for the moderns Father dear father Fear me not girl I will be brief unreasonably and unseasonably brief The soupe au vin occurs not in modern science but this is only one proof more if proof were needed that for the last few hundred years physicians have been idiots with their chicken broth and their decoction of gold whereby they attribute the highest qualities to that meat which has the least juice of any meat and to that metal which has less chemical qualities than all the metals mountebanks dunces homicides Since then from these no light is to be gathered go we to the chroniclers and first we find that Duguesclin a French knight being about to join battle with the English masters at that time of half France and sturdy strikers by sea and land drank not one but three soupes au vin in honour of the Blessed Trinity This done he charged the islanders and as might have been foretold killed a multitude and drove the rest into the sea But he was only the first of a long list of holy and hard hitting ones who have by this divine restorative been sustentated fortified corroborated and consoled Dear father prithee add thyself to that venerable company ere the soup cools And Margaret held the hat imploringly in both hands till he inserted the straw once more This spared them the modern instances and gave Gerard an opportunity of telling Margaret how proud his mother would be her soup had profited a man of learning Ay but said Margaret it would like her ill to see her son give all and take none himself Why brought you but two straws Fair mistress I hoped you would let me put my lips to your straw there being but two Margaret smiled and blushed Never beg that you may command said she The straw is not mine tis yours you cut it in yonder field I cut it and that made it mine but after that your lip touched it and that made it yours Did it Then I will lend it you There now it is yours again your lip has touched it No it belongs to us both now Let us divide it By all means you have a knife No I will not cut it that would be unlucky I ll bite it There I shall keep my half you will burn yours once you get home I doubt You know me not I waste nothing It is odds but I make a hairpin of it or something This answer dashed the novice Gerard instead of provoking him to fresh efforts and he was silent And now the bread and soup being disposed of the old scholar prepared to continue his journey Then came a little difficulty Gerard the adroit could not tie his ribbon again as Catherine had tied it Margaret after slily eyeing his efforts for some time offered to help him for at her age girls love to be coy and tender saucy and gentle by turns and she saw she had put him out of countenance but now Then a fair head with its stately crown of auburn hair glossy and glowing through silver bowed sweetly towards him and while it ravished his eye two white supple hands played delicately upon the stubborn ribbon and moulded it with soft and airy touches Then a heavenly thrill ran through the innocent young man and vague glimpses of a new world of feeling and sentiment opened on him And these new and exquisite sensations Margaret unwittingly prolonged it is not natural to her sex to hurry aught that pertains to the sacred toilet Nay when the taper fingers had at last subjugated the ends of the knot her mind was not quite easy till by a manoeuvre peculiar to the female hand she had made her palm convex and so applied it with a gentle pressure to the centre of the knot a sweet little coaxing hand kiss as much as to say Now be a good knot and stay so The palm kiss was bestowed on the ribbon but the wearer s heart leaped to meet it There that is how it was said Margaret and drew back to take one last keen survey of her work then looking up for simple approval of her skill received full in her eyes a longing gaze of such ardent adoration as made her lower them quickly and colour all over An indescribable tremor seized her and she retreated with downcast lashes and tell tale cheeks and took her father s arm on the opposite side Gerard blushing at having scared her away with his eyes took the other arm and so the two young things went downcast and conscious and propped the eagle along in silence They entered Rotterdam by the Schiedamze Poort and as Gerard was unacquainted with the town Peter directed him the way to the Hooch Straet in which the Stadthouse was He himself was going with Margaret to his cousin in the Ooster Waagen Straet so almost on entering the gate their roads lay apart They bade each other a friendly adieu and Gerard dived into the great town A profound sense of solitude fell upon him yet the streets were crowded Then he lamented too late that out of delicacy he had not asked his late companions who they were and where they lived Beshrew my shamefacedness said he But their words and their breeding were above their means and something did whisper me they would not be known I shall never see her more Oh weary world I hate you and your ways To think I must meet beauty and goodness and learning three pearls of price and never see them more Falling into this sad reverie and letting his body go where it would he lost his way but presently meeting a crowd of persons all moving in one direction he mingled with them for he argued they must be making for the Stadthouse Soon the noisy troop that contained the moody Gerard emerged not upon the Stadthouse but upon a large meadow by the side of the Maas and then the attraction was revealed Games of all sorts were going on wrestling the game of palm the quintain legerdemain archery tumbling in which art I blush to say women as well as men performed to the great delectation of the company There was also a trained bear who stood on his head and marched upright and bowed with prodigious gravity to his master and a hare that beat a drum and a cock that strutted on little stilts disdainfully These things made Gerard laugh now and then but the gay scene could not really enliven it for his heart was not in tune with it So hearing a young man say to his fellow that the Duke had been in the meadow but was gone to the Stadthouse to entertain the burgomasters and aldermen and the competitors for the prizes and their friends he suddenly remembered he was hungry and should like to sup with a prince He left the river side and this time he found the Hooch Straet and it speedily led him to the Stadthouse But when he got there he was refused first at one door then at another till he came to the great gate of the courtyard It was kept by soldiers and superintended by a pompous major domo glittering in an embroidered collar and a gold chain of office and holding a white staff with a gold knob There was a crowd of persons at the gate endeavouring to soften this official rock They came up in turn like ripples and retired as such in turn It cost Gerard a struggle to get near him and when he was within four heads of the gate he saw something that made his heart beat there was Peter with Margaret on his arm soliciting humbly for entrance My cousin the alderman is not at home they say he is here What is that to me old man If you will not let us pass in to him at least take this leaf from my tablet to my cousin See I have written his name he will come out to us For what do you take me I carry no messages I keep the gate He then bawled in a stentorian voice inexorably No strangers enter here but the competitors and their companies Come old man cried a voice in the crowd you have gotten your answer make way Margaret turned half round imploringly Good people we are come from far and my father is old and my cousin has a new servant that knows us not and would not let us sit in our cousin s house At this the crowd laughed hoarsely Margaret shrank as if they had struck her At that moment a hand grasped hers a magic grasp it felt like heart meeting heart or magnet steel She turned quickly round at it and it was Gerard Such a little cry of joy and appeal came from her bosom and she began to whimper prettily They had hustled her and frightened her for one thing and her cousin s thoughtlessness in not even telling his servant they were coming was cruel and the servant s caution however wise and faithful to her master was bitterly mortifying to her father and her And to her so mortified and anxious and jostled came suddenly this kind hand and face Hinc illae lacrimae All is well now remarked a coarse humourist she hath gotten her sweetheart Haw haw haw went the crowd She dropped Gerard s hand directly and turned round with eyes flashing through her tears I have no sweetheart you rude men But I am friendless in your boorish town and this is a friend and one who knows what you know not how to treat the aged and the weak The crowd was dead silent They had only been thoughtless and now felt the rebuke though severe was just The silence enabled Gerard to treat with the porter I am a competitor sir What is your name and the man eyed him suspiciously Gerard the son of Elias The janitor inspected a slip of parchment he held in his hand Gerard Eliassoen can enter With my company these two Nay those are not your company they came before you What matter They are my friends and without them I go not in Stay without then That will I not That we shall see We will and speedily And with this Gerard raised a voice of astounding volume and power and routed so that the whole street rang Ho PHILIP EARL OF HOLLAND Are you mad cried the porter HERE IS ONE OF YOUR VARLETS DEFIES YOU Hush hush AND WILL NOT LET YOUR GUESTS PASS IN Hush murder The Dukes there I m dead cried the janitor quaking Then suddenly trying to overpower Gerard s thunder he shouted with all his lungs OPEN THE GATE YE KNAVES WAY THERE FOR GERARD ELIASSOEN AND HIS COMPANY The fiends go with him The gate swung open as by magic Eight soldiers lowered their pikes halfway and made an arch under which the victorious three marched in triumphant The moment they had passed the pikes clashed together horizontally to bar the gateway and all but pinned an abdominal citizen that sought to wedge in along with them Once past the guarded portal a few steps brought the trio upon a scene of Oriental luxury The courtyard was laid out in tables loaded with rich meats and piled with gorgeous plate Guests in rich and various costumes sat beneath a leafy canopy of fresh cut branches fastened tastefully to golden silver and blue silken cords that traversed the area and fruits of many hues including some artificial ones of gold silver and wax hung pendant or peeped like fair eyes among the green leaves of plane trees and lime trees The Duke s minstrels swept their lutes at intervals and a fountain played red Burgundy in six jets that met and battled in the air The evening sun darted its fires through those bright and purple wine spouts making them jets and cascades of molten rubies then passing on tinged with the blood of the grape shed crimson glories here and there on fair faces snowy beards velvet satin jewelled hilts glowing gold gleaming silver and sparkling glass Gerard and his friends stood dazzled spell bound Presently a whisper buzzed round them Salute the Duke Salute the Duke They looked up and there on high under the dais was their sovereign bidding them welcome with a kindly wave of the hand The men bowed low and Margaret curtsied with a deep and graceful obeisance The Duke s hand being up he gave it another turn and pointed the new comers out to a knot of valets Instantly seven of his people with an obedient start went headlong at our friends seated them at a table and put fifteen many coloured soups before them in little silver bowls and as many wines in crystal vases Nay father let us not eat until we have thanked our good friend said Margaret now first recovering from all this bustle Girl he is our guardian angel Gerard put his face into his hands Tell me when you have done said he and I will reappear and have my supper for I am hungry I know which of us three is the happiest at meeting again Me inquired Margaret No guess again Father No Then I have no guess which it can be and she gave a little crow of happiness and gaiety The soup was tasted and vanished in a twirl of fourteen hands and fish came on the table in a dozen forms with patties of lobster and almonds mixed and of almonds and cream and an immense variety of brouets known to us as rissoles The next trifle was a wild boar which smelt divine Why then did Margaret start away from it with two shrieks of dismay and pinch so good a friend as Gerard Because the Duke s cuisinier had been too clever had made this excellent dish too captivating to the sight as well as taste He had restored to the animal by elaborate mimicry with burnt sugar and other edible colours the hair and bristles he had robbed him of by fire and water To make him still more enticing the huge tusks were carefully preserved in the brute s jaw and gave his mouth the winning smile that comes of tusk in man or beast and two eyes of coloured sugar glowed in his head St Argus what eyes so bright so bloodshot so threatening they followed a man and every movement of his knife and spoon But indeed I need the pencil of Granville or Tenniel to make you see the two gilt valets on the opposite side of the table putting the monster down before our friends with a smiling self satisfied benevolent obsequiousness for this ghastly monster was the flower of all comestibles old Peter clasping both hands in pious admiration of it Margaret wheeling round with horror stricken eyes and her hand on Gerard s shoulder squeaking and pinching his face of unwise delight at being pinched the grizzly brute glaring sulkily on all and the guests grinning from ear to ear What s to do shouted the Duke hearing the signals of female distress Seven of his people with a zealous start went headlong and told him He laughed and said Give her of the beef stuffing then and bring me Sir Boar Benevolent monarch The beef stuffing was his own private dish On these grand occasions an ox was roasted whole and reserved for the poor But this wise as well as charitable prince had discovered that whatever venison bares lamb poultry etc you skewered into that beef cavern got cooked to perfection retaining their own juices and receiving those of the reeking ox These he called his beef stuffing and took delight therein as did now our trio for at his word seven of his people went headlong and drove silver tridents into the steaming cave at random and speared a kid a cygnet and a flock of wildfowl These presently smoked before Gerard and company and Peter s face sad and slightly morose at the loss of the savage hog expanded and shone After this twenty different tarts of fruits and herbs and last of all confectionery on a Titanic scale cathedrals of sugar all gilt painted in the interstices of the bas reliefs castles with moats and ditches imitated to the life elephants camels toads knights on horseback jousting kings and princesses looking on trumpeters blowing and all these personages eating and their veins filled with sweet scented juices works of art made to be destroyed The guests breached a bastion crunched a crusader and his horse and lance or cracked a bishop cope chasuble crosier and all as remorselessly as we do a caraway comfit sipping meanwhile hippocras and other spiced drinks and Greek and Corsican wines while every now and then little Turkish boys turbaned spangled jewelled and gilt came offering on bended knee golden troughs of rose water and orange water to keep the guests hands cool and perfumed But long before our party arrived at this final stage appetite had succumbed and Gerard had suddenly remembered he was the bearer of a letter to the Princess Marie and in an under tone had asked one of the servants if he would undertake to deliver it The man took it with a deep obeisance He could not deliver it himself but would instantly give it one of the Princess s suite several of whom were about It may be remembered that Peter and Margaret came here not to dine but to find their cousin Well the old gentleman ate heartily and being much fatigued dropped asleep and forgot all about his cousin Margaret did not remind him we shall hear why Meanwhile that Cousin was seated within a few feet of them at their backs and discovered them when Margaret turned round and screamed at the boar But he forbore to speak to them for municipal reasons Margaret was very plainly dressed and Peter inclined to threadbare So the alderman said to himself Twill be time to make up to them when the sun sets and the company disperses then I will take my poor relations to my house and none will be the wiser Half the courses were lost on Gerard and Margaret They were no great eaters and just now were feeding on sweet thoughts that have ever been unfavourable to appetite But there is a delicate kind of sensuality to whose influence these two were perhaps more sensitive than any other pair in that assembly the delights of colour music and perfume all of which blended so fascinatingly here Margaret leaned back and half closed her eyes and murmured to Gerard What a lovely scene the warm sun the green shade the rich dresses the bright music of the lutes and the cool music of the fountain and all faces so happy and gay and then it is to you we owe it Gerard was silent all but his eyes observing which Now speak not to me said Margaret languidly let me listen to the fountain what are you a competitor for He told her Very well You will gain one prize at least Which which have you seen any of my work I no But you will gain a prize I hope so but what makes you think so Because you were so good to my father Gerard smiled at the feminine logic and hung his head at the sweet praise and was silent Speak not murmured Margaret They say this is a world of sin and misery Can that be What is your opinion No that is all a silly old song explained Gerard Tis a byword our elders keep repeating out of custom it is not true How can you know You are but a child said Margaret with pensive dignity Why only look round And then thought I had lost you for ever and you are by my side and now the minstrels are going to play again Sin and misery Stuff and nonsense The lutes burst out The courtyard rang again with their delicate harmony What do you admire most of all these beautiful things Gerard You know my name How is that White magic I am a witch Angels are never witches But I can t think how you Foolish boy was it not cried at the gate loud enough to deave one So it was Where is my head What do I admire most If you will sit a little more that way I ll tell you This way Yes so that the light may fall on you There I see many fair things here fairer than I could have conceived but the fairest of all to my eye is your lovely hair in its silver frame and the setting sun kissing it It minds me of what the Vulgate praises for beauty an apple of gold in a network of silver and oh what a pity I did not know you before I sent in my poor endeavours at illuminating I could illuminate so much better now I could do everything better There now the sun is full on it it is like an aureole So our Lady looked and none since her until to day Oh fie it is wicked to talk so Compare a poor coarse favoured girl like me with the Queen of Heaven Oh Gerard I thought you were a good young man And Margaret was shocked apparently Gerard tried to explain I am no worse than the rest but how can I help having eyes and a heart Margaret Gerard Be not angry now Now is it likely I love you Oh for shame you must not say that to me and Margaret coloured furiously at this sudden assault I can t help it I love you I love you Hush hush for pity s sake I must not listen to such words from a stranger I am ungrateful to call you a stranger Oh how one may be mistaken If I had known you were so bold And Margaret s bosom began to heave and her cheeks were covered with blushes and she looked towards her sleeping father very much like a timid thing that meditates actual flight Then Gerard was frightened at the alarm he caused Forgive me said he imploringly How could any one help loving you Well sir I will try and forgive you you are so good in other respects but then you must promise me never to say you to say that again Give me your hand then or you don t forgive me She hesitated but eventually put out her hand a very little way very slowly and with seeming reluctance He took it and held it prisoner When she thought it had been there long enough she tried gently to draw it away He held it tight it submitted quite patiently to force What is the use resisting force She turned her head away and her long eyelashes drooped sweetly Gerard lost nothing by his promise Words were not needed here and silence was more eloquent Nature was in that day what she is in ours but manners were somewhat freer Then as now virgins drew back alarmed at the first words of love but of prudery and artificial coquetry there was little and the young soon read one another s hearts Everything was on Gerard s side his good looks her belief in his goodness her gratitude and opportunity for at the Duke s banquet this mellow summer eve all things disposed the female nature to tenderness the avenues to the heart lay open the senses were so soothed and subdued with lovely colours gentle sounds and delicate odours the sun gently sinking the warm air the green canopy the cool music of the now violet fountain Gerard and Margaret sat hand in hand in silence and Gerard s eyes sought hers lovingly and hers now and then turned on him timidly and imploringly and presently two sweet unreasonable tears rolled down her cheeks and she smiled while they were drying yet they did not take long
