Ite missa est The high mass is finished and the antique church is emptying Outside in the yard among the tombs the assistants scatter And all the joy of a sunny noon greets them as they come out of the sombre nave where each according to his naive faculties had caught more or less a glimpse of the great mystery and of the inevitable death Wearing all the uniform national cap the men come down the exterior stairway the women slower to be captivated by the lure of the blue sky retaining still under the mourning veil a little of the dream of the church come out of the lower porticoes in black troops around a grave freshly closed some stop and weep The southern wind which is the great magician of the Basque country blows softly The autumn of yesterday has gone and it is forgotten Lukewarm breaths pass through the air vivifying healthier than those of May having the odor of hay and the odor of flowers Two singers of the highway are there leaning on the graveyard wall and they intone with a tambourine and a guitar an old seguidilla of Spain bringing here the warm and somewhat Arabic gaieties of the lands beyond the frontiers And in the midst of all this intoxication of the southern November more delicious in this country than the intoxication of the spring Ramuntcho having come down one of the first watches the coming out of the sisters in order to greet Gracieuse The sandal peddler has come also to this closing of the mass and displays among the roses of the tombs his linen foot coverings ornamented with woolen flowers Young men attracted by the dazzling embroideries gather around him to select colors The bees and the flies buzz as in June the country has become again for a few hours for a few days for as long as this wind will blow luminous and warm In front of the mountains which have assumed violent brown or sombre green tints and which seem to have advanced to day until they overhang the church houses of the village appear in relief very neat very white under their coat of kalsomine old Pyrenean houses with their wooden balconies and on their walls intercrossings of beams in the fashion of the olden time In the southwest the visible portion of Spain the denuded and red peak familiar to smugglers stands straight and near in the beautiful clear sky Gracieuse does not appear yet retarded doubtless by the nuns in some altar service As for Franchita who never mingles in the Sunday festivals she takes the path to her house silent and haughty after a smile to her son whom she will not see again until to night after the dances have come to an end A group of young men among whom is the vicar who has just taken off his golden ornaments forms itself at the threshold of the church in the sun and seems to be plotting grave projects They are the great players of the country the fine flower of the lithe and the strong it is for the pelota game of the afternoon that they are consulting and they make a sign to Ramuntcho who pensively comes to them Several old men come also and surround them caps crushed on white hair and faces clean shaven like those of monks champions of the olden time still proud of their former successes and sure that their counsel shall be respected in the national game which the men here attend with pride as on a field of honor After a courteous discussion the game is arranged it will be immediately after vespers they will play the blaid with the wicker glove and the six selected champions divided into two camps shall be the vicar Ramuntcho and Arrochkoa Gracieuse s brother against three famous men of the neighboring villages Joachim of Mendiazpi Florentino of Espelette and Irrubeta of Hasparren Now comes the convoy which comes out of the church and passes by them so black in this feast of light and so archaic with the envelope of its capes of its caps and of its veils They are expressive of the Middle Age these people while they pass in a file the Middle Age whose shadow the Basque country retains And they express above all death as the large funereal slabs with which the nave is paved express it as the cypress trees and the tombs express it and all the things in this place where the men come to pray express it death always death But a death very softly neighboring life under the shield of the old consoling symbols for life is there marked also almost equally sovereign in the warm rays which light up the cemetery in the eyes of the children who play among the roses of autumn in the smile of those beautiful brown girls who the mass being finished return with steps indolently supple toward the village in the muscles of all this youthfulness of men alert and vigorous who shall soon exercise at the ball game their iron legs and arms And of this group of old men and of boys at the threshold of a church of this mingling so peacefully harmonious of death and of life comes the benevolent lesson the teaching that one must enjoy in time strength and love then without obstinacy in enduring submit to the universal law of passing and dying repeating with confidence like these simple minded and wise men the same prayers by which the agonies of the ancestors were cradled It is improbably radiant the sun of noon in this yard of the dead The air is exquisite and one becomes intoxicated by breathing it The Pyrenean horizons have been swept of their clouds their least vapors and it seems as if the wind of the south had brought here the limpidities of Andalusia or of Africa The Basque guitar and tambourine accompany the sung seguilla which the beggars of Spain throw like a slight irony into this lukewarm breeze above the dead And boys and girls think of the fandango of to night feel ascending in them the desire and the intoxication of dancing At last here come the sisters so long expected by Ramuntcho with them advance Gracieuse and her mother Dolores who is still in widow s weeds her face invisible under a black cape closed by a crape veil What can this Dolores be plotting with the Mother Superior Ramuntcho knowing that these two women are enemies is astonished and disquiet to day to see them walk side by side Now they even stop to talk aside so important and secret doubtless is what they are saying their similar black caps overhanging like wagon hoods touch each other and they talk sheltered under them a whispering of phantoms one would say under a sort of little black vault And Ramuntcho has the sentiment of something hostile plotted against him under these two wicked caps When the colloquy comes to an end he advances touches his cap for a salute awkward and timid suddenly in presence of this Dolores whose harsh look under the veil he divines This woman is the only person in the world who has the power to chill him and never elsewhere than in her presence he feels weighing upon him the blemish of being the child of an unknown father of wearing no other name than that of his mother To day however to his great surprise she is more cordial than usual and she says with a voice almost amiable Good morning my boy Then he goes to Gracieuse to ask her with a brusque anxiety To night at eight o clock say if you will be on the square to dance with me For some time every Sunday had brought to him the same fear of being deprived of dancing with her in the evening In the week he hardly ever saw her Now that he was becoming a man the only occasion for him to have her company was this ball on the green of the square in the light of the stars or of the moon They had fallen in love with each other five years ago Ramuntcho and Gracieuse when they were still children And such loves when by chance the awakening of the senses confirms instead of destroying them become in young heads something sovereign and exclusive They had never thought of saying this to each other they knew it so well never had they talked together of the future which did not appear possible to one without the other And the isolation of this mountain village where they lived perhaps also the hostility of Dolores to their naive unexpressed projects brought them more closely together To night at eight o clock say if you will be on the square to dance with me Yes replies the little girl fixing on her friend eyes of sadness a little frightened as well as of ardent tenderness Sure asked Ramuntcho again whom these eyes make anxious Yes sure So he is quieted again this time knowing that if Gracieuse has said and decided something one may count on it And at once the weather seems to him more beautiful the Sunday more amusing life more charming The dinner hour calls the Basques now to the houses or to the inns and under the light somewhat gloomy of the noon sun the village seems deserted Ramuntcho goes to the cider mill which the smugglers and pelota players frequent There he sits at a table his cap still drawn over his eyes with his friends Arrochkoa two or three others of the mountains and the somber Itchoua their chief A festive meal is prepared for them with fish of the Nivelle ham and hares In the foreground of the hall vast and dilapidated near the windows are the tables the oak benches on which they are seated in the background in a penumbra are the enormous casks filled with new cider In this band of Ramuntcho which is there entire under the piercing eye of its chief reigns an emulation of audacity and a reciprocal fraternal devotion during their night expeditions especially they are all one to live or to die Leaning heavily benumbed in the pleasure of resting after the fatigues of the night and concentrated in the expectation of satiating their robust hunger they are silent at first hardly raising their heads to look through the window panes at the passing girls Two are very young almost children like Ramuntcho Arrochkoa and Florentino The others have like Itchoua hardened faces eyes in ambuscade under the frontal arcade expressing no certain age their aspect reveals a past of fatigues in the unreasonable obstinacy to pursue this trade of smuggling which hardly gives bread to the less skilful Then awakened little by little by the smoking dishes by the sweet cider they talk soon their words interlace light rapid and sonorous with an excessive rolling of the r They talk in their mysterious language the origin of which is unknown and which seems to the men of the other countries in Europe more distant than Mongolian or Sanskrit They tell stories of the night and of the frontier stratagems newly invented and astonishing deceptions of Spanish carbineers Itchoua the chief listens more than he talks one hears only at long intervals his profound voice of a church singer vibrate Arrochkoa the most elegant of all is in striking contrast with his comrades of the mountain His name was Jean Detcharry but he was known only by his surname which the elders of his family transmitted from father to son for centuries A smuggler for his pleasure he without any necessity and possessing beautiful lands in the sunlight the face fresh and pretty the blonde mustache turned up in the fashion of cats the eye feline also the eye caressing and fleeting attracted by all that succeeds by all that amuses by all that shines liking Ramuntcho for his triumphs in the ball game and quite disposed to give to him the hand of his sister Gracieuse even if it were only to oppose his mother Dolores And Florentino the other great friend of Ramuntcho is on the contrary the humblest of the band an athletic reddish fellow with wide and low forehead with good eyes of resignation soft as those of beasts of burden without father or mother possessing nothing in the world except a threadbare costume and three pink cotton shirts unique lover of a little fifteen year old orphan as poor as he and as primitive At last Itchoua deigns to talk in his turn He relates in a tone of mystery and of confidence a certain tale of the time of his youth in a black night on the Spanish territory in the gorges of Andarlaza Seized by two carbineers at the turn in a dark path he had disengaged himself by drawing his knife to stab a chest with it half a second a resisting flesh then crack the blade entering brusquely a jet of warm blood on his hand the man fallen and he fleeing in the obscure rocks And the voice which says these things with implacable tranquility is the same which for years sings piously every Sunday the liturgy in the old sonorous church so much so that it seems to retain a religious and almost sacred character When you are caught adds the speaker scrutinizing them all with his eyes become piercing again When you are caught What is the life of a man worth in such a case You would not hesitate either I suppose if you were caught Sure not replied Arrochkoa in a tone of infantile bravado Sure not In such a case to take the life of a carabinero no one would hesitate The debonair Florentino turned from Itchoua his disapproving eyes Florentino would hesitate he would not kill This is divined in the expression of his face You would not hesitate repeated Itchoua scrutinizing Ramuntcho this time in a special manner you would not hesitate either I suppose if you were caught would you Surely replied Ramuntcho submissively Oh no surely But his look like that of Florentino has turned from Itchoua A terror comes to him of this man of this imperious and cold influence so completely felt already an entire soft and refined side of his nature is awakened made disquiet and in revolt Silence has followed the tale and Itchoua discontented with the effect of it proposes a song in order to change the course of ideas The purely material well being which comes after dinner the cider which has been drunk the cigarettes which are lighted and the songs that begin bring back quickly confident joy in these children s heads And then there are in the band the two brothers Iragola Marcos and Joachim young men of the mountain above Mendiazpi who are renowned extemporary speakers in the surrounding country and it is a pleasure to hear them on any subject compose and sing verses which are so pretty Let us see says Itchoua you Marcos are a sailor who wishes to pass his life on the ocean and seek fortune in America you Joachim are a farm hand who prefers not to quit his village and his soil here Each of you will discuss alternately in couplets of equal length the pleasures of his trade to the tune to the tune of the Iru Damacho Go on They looked at each other the two brothers half turned toward each other on the oak bench where they sit an instant of reflection during which an imperceptible agitation of the eyelids alone betrays the working of their minds then brusquely Marcos the elder begins and they will never stop With their shaven cheeks their handsome profiles their chins which advance somewhat imperiously above the powerful muscles of the neck they recall in their grave immobility the figures engraved on the Roman medals They sing with a certain effort of the throat like the muezzins in the mosques in high tones When one has finished his couplet without a second of hesitation or silence the other begins more and more their minds are animated and inflamed Around the smugglers table many other caps have gathered and all listen with admiration to the witty or sensible things which the two brothers know how to say ever with the needed cadence and rhyme At the twentieth stanza at last Itchoua interrupts them to make them rest and he orders more cider How have you learned asked Ramuntcho of the Iragola brothers How did the knack come to you Oh replies Marcos it is a family trait as you must know Our father our grandfather were extemporary composers who were heard with pleasure in all the festivals of the Basque country and our mother also was the daughter of a grand improvisator of the village of Lesaca And then every evening in taking back the oxen or in milking the cows we practice or at the fireside on winter nights Yes every evening we make compositions in this way on subjects which one of us imagines and it is our greatest pleasure But when Florentino s turn to sing comes he knowing only the old refrains of the mountain intones in an Arabic falsetto voice the complaint of the linen weaver and then Ramuntcho who had sung it the day before in the autumn twilight sees again the darkened sky of yesterday the clouds full of rain the cart drawn by oxen going down into a sad and closed valley toward a solitary farm and suddenly the unexplained anguish returns to him the one which he had before the fear of living and of passing thus always in these same villages under the oppression of these same mountains the notion and the confused desire for other places the anxiety for unknown distances His eyes become lifeless and fixed look inwardly for several strange minutes he feels that he is an exile from what country he does not know disinherited of what he does not know sad in the depths of his soul between him and the men who surround him have come suddenly irreducible hereditary barriers Three o clock It is the hour when vespers the last office of the day comes to an end the hour when leave the church in a meditation grave as that of the morning all the mantillas of black cloth concealing the beautiful hair of the girls and the form of their waists all the woolen caps similarly lowered on the shaven faces of men on their eyes piercing or somber still plunged in the old time dreams It is the hour when the games are to begin the dances the pelota and the fandango All this is traditional and immutable The light of the day becomes more golden one feels the approach of night The church suddenly empty forgotten where persists the odor of incense becomes full of silence and the old gold of the background shines mysteriously in the midst of more shade silence also is scattered around on the tranquil enclosure of the dead where the folks this time passed without stopping in their haste to go elsewhere On the square of the ball game people are beginning to arrive from everywhere from the village itself and from the neighboring hamlets from the huts of the shepherds or of the smugglers who perch above on the harsh mountains Hundreds of Basque caps all similar are now reunited ready to judge the players to applaud or to murmur they discuss the chances comment upon the relative strength of the players and make big bets of money And young girls young women gather also having nothing of the awkwardness of the peasants in other provinces of France elegant refined graceful in costumes of the new fashions some wearing on their hair the silk kerchief rolled and arranged like a small cap others bareheaded their hair dressed in the most modern manner most of them pretty with admirable eyes and very long eyebrows This square always solemn and ordinarily somewhat sad is filled to day Sunday with a lively and gay crowd The most insignificant hamlet in the Basque country has a square for the ball game large carefully kept in general near the church under oaks But here this is a central point and something like the Conservatory of French ball players of those who become celebrated in South America as well as in the Pyrenees and who in the great international games oppose the champions of Spain So the place is particularly beautiful and pompous surprising in so distant a village It is paved with large stones between which grass grows expressing its antiquity and giving to it an air of being abandoned On the two sides are extended for the spectators long benches made of the red granite of the neighboring mountain and at this moment all overgrown with autumn scabwort And in the back the old monumental wall rises against which the balls will strike It has a rounded front which seems to be the silhouette of a dome and bears this inscription half effaced by time Blaidka haritzea debakatua The blaid game is forbidden Still the day s game is to be the blaid but the venerable inscription dates from the time of the splendor of the national game degenerated at present as all things degenerate It had been placed there to preserve the tradition of the rebot a more difficult game exacting more agility and strength and which has been perpetuated only in the Spanish province of Guipuzcoa While the graded benches are filling up the paved square which the grass makes green and which has seen the lithe and the vigorous men of the country run since the days of old remains empty The beautiful autumn sun at its decline warms and lights it Here and there some tall oaks shed their leaves above the seated spectators Beyond are the high church and the cypress trees the entire sacred corner from which the saints and the dead seem to be looking at a distance protecting the players interested in this game which is the passion still of an entire race and characterises it At last they enter the arena the Pelotaris the six champions among whom is one in a cassock the vicar of the parish With him are some other personages the crier who in an instant will sing the points the five judges selected among the experts of different villages to intervene in cases of litigation and some others carrying extra balls and sandals At the right wrist the players attach with thongs a strange wicker thing resembling a large curved fingernail which lengthens the forearm by half It is with this glove manufactured in France by a unique basket maker of the village of Ascain that they will have to catch throw and hurl the pelota a small ball of tightened cord covered with sheepskin which is as hard as a wooden ball Now they try the balls selecting the best limbering with a few points that do not count their athletic arms Then they take off their waistcoats and carry them to preferred spectators Ramuntcho gives his to Gracieuse seated in the first row on the lower bench And all except the priest who will play in his black gown are in battle array their chests at liberty in pink cotton shirts or light thread fleshings The assistants know them well these players in a moment they shall be excited for or against them and will shout at them frantically as it happens with the toreadors At this moment the village is entirely animated by the spirit of the olden time in its expectation of the pleasure in its liveliness in its ardor it is intensely Basque and very old under the great shade of the Gizune the overhanging mountain which throws over it a twilight charm And the game begins in the melancholy evening The ball thrown with much strength flies strikes the wall in great quick blows then rebounds and traverses the air with the rapidity of a bullet This wall in the background rounded like a dome s festoon on the sky has become little by little crowned with heads of children little Basques little cats ball players of the future who soon will precipitate themselves like a flight of birds to pick up the ball every time when thrown too high it will go beyond the square and fall in the fields The game becomes gradually warmer as arms and legs are limbered in an intoxication of movement and swiftness Already Ramuntcho is acclaimed And the vicar also shall be one of the fine players of the day strange to look upon with his leaps similar to those of a cat and his athletic gestures imprisoned in his priest s gown This is the rule of the game when one of the champions of the two camps lets the ball fall it is a point earned by the adverse camp and ordinarily the limit is sixty points After each point the titled crier chants with a full voice in his old time tongue The but has so much the refil has so much gentlemen The but is the camp which played first the refil is the camp opposed to the but And the crier s long clamor drags itself above the noise of the crowd which approves or murmurs On the square the zone gilt and reddened by the sun diminishes goes devoured by the shade more and more the great screen of the Gizune predominates over everything seems to enclose in this little corner of the world at its feet the very special life and the ardor of these mountaineers who are the fragments of a people very mysteriously unique without analogy among nations The shade of night marches forward and invades in silence soon it will be sovereign in the distance only a few summits still lighted above so many darkened valleys are of a violet luminous and pink Ramuntcho plays as in his life he had never played before he is in one of those instants when one feels tempered by strength light weighing nothing and when it is a pure joy to move to extend one s arms to leap But Arrochkoa weakens the vicar is fettered two or three times by his black cassock and the adverse camp at first distanced little by little catches up then in presence of this game so valiantly disputed clamor redoubles and caps fly in the air thrown by enthusiastic hands Now the points are equal on both sides the crier announces thirty for each one of the rival camps and he sings the old refrain which is of tradition immemorial in such cases Let bets come forward Give drink to the judges and to the players It is the signal for an instant of rest while wine shall be brought into the arena at the cost of the village The players sit down and Ramuntcho takes a place beside Gracieuse who throws on his shoulders wet with perspiration the waistcoat which she was keeping for him Then he asks of his little friend to undo the thongs which hold the glove of wood wicker and leather on his reddened arm And he rests in the pride of his success seeing only smiles of greeting on the faces of the girls at whom he looks But he sees also on the side opposed to the players wall on the side of the approaching darkness the archaic assemblage of Basque houses the little square of the village with its kalsomined porches and its old plane trees then the old massive belfry of the church and higher than everything dominating everything crushing everything the abrupt mass of the Gizune from which comes so much shade from which descends on this distant village so hasty an impression of night Truly it encloses too much that mountain it imprisons it impresses And Ramuntcho in his juvenile triumph is troubled by the sentiment of this by this furtive and vague attraction of other places so often mingled with his troubles and with his joys The game continues and his thoughts are lost in the physical intoxication of beginning the struggle again From instant to instant clack the snap of the pelotas their sharp noise against the glove which throws them or the wall which receives them their same noise giving the notion of all the strength displayed Clack it will snap till the hour of twilight the pelota animated furiously by arms powerful and young At times the players with a terrible shock stop it in its flight with a shock that would break other muscles than theirs Most often sure of themselves they let it quietly touch the soil almost die it seems as if they would never catch it and clack it goes off however caught just in time thanks to a marvellous precision of the eye and strikes the wall ever with the rapidity of a bullet When it wanders on the benches on the mass of woolen caps and of pretty hair ornamented with silk kerchiefs all the heads then all the bodies are lowered as if moved by the wind of its passage for it must not be touched it must not be stopped as long as it is living and may still be caught then when it is really lost dead some one of the assistants does himself the honor to pick it up and throw it back to the players The night falls falls the last golden colors scatter with serene melancholy over the highest summits of the Basque country In the deserted church profound silence is established and antique images regard one another alone through the invasion of night Oh the sadness of ends of festivals in very isolated villages as soon as the sun sets Meanwhile Ramuntcho is more and more the great conqueror And the plaudits the cries redouble his happy boldness each time he makes a point the men standing now on the old graded granite benches acclaim him with southern fury The last point the sixtieth It is Ramuntcho s and he has won the game Then there is a sudden crumbling into the arena of all the Basque caps which ornamented the stone amphitheatre they press around the players who have made themselves immovable suddenly in tired attitudes And Ramuntcho unfastens the thongs of his glove in the middle of a crowd of expansive admirers from all sides brave and rude hands are stretched to grasp his or to strike his shoulder amicably Have you asked Gracieuse to dance with you this evening asks Arrochkoa who in this instant would do anything for him Yes when she came out of the high mass I spoke to her She has promised Good I feared that mother Oh I would have arranged it in any case you may believe me A robust old man with square shoulders with square jaws with a beardless monkish face before whom all bowed with respect comes also it is Haramburu a player of the olden time who was celebrated half a century ago in America for the game of rebot and who earned a small fortune Ramuntcho blushes with pleasure at the compliment of this old man who is hard to please And beyond standing on the reddish benches among the long grasses and the November scabwort his little friend whom a group of young girls follows turns back to smile at him to send to him with her hand a gentle adios in the Spanish fashion He is a young god in this moment Ramuntcho people are proud to know him to be among his friends to get his waistcoat for him to talk to him to touch him Now with the other pelotaris he goes to the neighboring inn to a room where are placed the clean clothes of all and where careful friends accompany them to rub their bodies wet with perspiration And a moment afterward elegant in a white shirt his cap on the side he comes out of the door under the plane trees shaped like vaults to enjoy again his success see the people pass continue to gather compliments and smiles The autumnal day has declined it is evening at present In the lukewarm air bats glide The mountaineers of the surrounding villages depart one by one a dozen carriages are harnessed their lanterns are lighted their bells ring and they disappear in the little shady paths of the valleys In the middle of the limpid penumbra may be distinguished the women the pretty girls seated on benches in front of the houses under the vaults of the plane trees they are only clear forms their Sunday costumes make white spots in the twilight pink spots and the pale blue spot which Ramuntcho looks at is the new gown of Gracieuse Above all filling the sky the gigantic Gizune confused and sombre is as if it were the centre and the source of the darkness little by little scattered over all things And at the church suddenly the pious bells ring recalling to distracted minds the enclosure where the graves are the cypress trees around the belfry and the entire grand mystery of the sky of prayer of inevitable death Oh the sadness of ends of festivals in very isolated villages when the sun ceases to illuminate and when it is autumn They know very well these men who were so ardent a moment ago in the humble pleasures of the day that in the cities there are other festivals more brilliant more beautiful and less quickly ended but this is something separate it is the festival of the country of their own country and nothing can replace for them these furtive instants whereof they have thought for so many days in advance Lovers who will depart toward the scattered houses flanking the Pyrenees couples who to morrow will begin over their monotonous and rude life look at one another before separating look at one another under the falling night with regretful eyes that say Then it is finished
