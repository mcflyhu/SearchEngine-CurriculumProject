Early in March Miss Bront obtained her second and last situation as a governess This time she esteemed herself fortunate in becoming a member of a kind hearted and friendly household The master of it she especially regarded as a valuable friend whose advice helped to guide her in one very important step of her life But as her definite acquirements were few she had to eke them out by employing her leisure time in needlework and altogether her position was that of bonne or nursery governess liable to repeated and never ending calls upon her time This description of uncertain yet perpetual employment subject to the exercise of another person s will at all hours of the day was peculiarly trying to one whose life at home had been full of abundant leisure Idle she never was in any place but of the multitude of small talks plans duties pleasures c that make up most people s days her home life was nearly destitute This made it possible for her to go through long and deep histories of feeling and imagination for which others odd as it sounds have rarely time This made it inevitable that later on in her too short career the intensity of her feeling should wear out her physical health The habit of making out which had grown with her growth and strengthened with her strength had become a part of her nature Yet all exercise of her strongest and most characteristic faculties was now out of the question She could not as while she was at Miss W s feel amidst the occupations of the day that when evening came she might employ herself in more congenial ways No doubt all who enter upon the career of a governess have to relinquish much no doubt it must ever be a life of sacrifice but to Charlotte Bront it was a perpetual attempt to force all her faculties into a direction for which the whole of her previous life had unfitted them Moreover the little Bront s had been brought up motherless and from knowing nothing of the gaiety and the sportiveness of childhood from never having experienced caresses or fond attentions themselves they were ignorant of the very nature of infancy or how to call out its engaging qualities Children were to them the troublesome necessities of humanity they had never been drawn into contact with them in any other way Years afterwards when Miss Bront came to stay with us she watched our little girls perpetually and I could not persuade her that they were only average specimens of well brought up children She was surprised and touched by any sign of thoughtfulness for others of kindness to animals or of unselfishness on their part and constantly maintained that she was in the right and I in the wrong when we differed on the point of their unusual excellence All this must be borne in mind while reading the following letters And it must likewise be borne in mind by those who surviving her look back upon her life from their mount of observation how no distaste no suffering ever made her shrink from any course which she believed it to be her duty to engage in March rd I told some time since that I meant to get a situation and when I said so my resolution was quite fixed I felt that however often I was disappointed I had no intention of relinquishing my efforts After being severely baffled two or three times after a world of trouble in the way of correspondence and interviews I have at length succeeded and am fairly established in my new place The house is not very large but exceedingly comfortable and well regulated the grounds are fine and extensive In taking the place I have made a large sacrifice in the way of salary in the hope of securing comfort by which word I do not mean to express good eating and drinking or warm fire or a soft bed but the society of cheerful faces and minds and hearts not dug out of a lead mine or cut from a marble quarry My salary is not really more than l per annum though it is nominally l but the expense of washing will be deducted therefrom My pupils are two in number a girl of eight and a boy of six As to my employers you will not expect me to say much about their characters when I tell you that I only arrived here yesterday I have not the faculty of telling an individual s disposition at first sight Before I can venture to pronounce on a character I must see it first under various lights and from various points of view All I can say therefore is both Mr and Mrs seem to me good sort of people I have as yet had no cause to complain of want of considerateness or civility My pupils are wild and unbroken but apparently well disposed I wish I may be able to say as much next time I write to you My earnest wish and endeavour will be to please them If I can but feel that I am giving satisfaction and if at the same time I can keep my health I shall I hope be moderately happy But no one but myself can tell how hard a governess s work is to me for no one but myself is aware how utterly averse my whole mind and nature are for the employment Do not think that I fail to blame myself for this or that I leave any means unemployed to conquer this feeling Some of my greatest difficulties lie in things that would appear to you comparatively trivial I find it so hard to repel the rude familiarity of children I find it so difficult to ask either servants or mistress for anything I want however much I want it It is less pain for me to endure the greatest inconvenience than to go into the kitchen to request its removal I am a fool Heaven knows I cannot help it Now can you tell me whether it is considered improper for governesses to ask their friends to come and see them I do not mean of course to stay but just for a call of an hour or two If it is not absolute treason I do fervently request that you will contrive in some way or other to let me have a sight of your face Yet I feel at the same time that I am making a very foolish and almost impracticable demand yet this is only four miles from B March st You must excuse a very short answer to your most welcome letter for my time is entirely occupied Mrs expected a good deal of sewing from me I cannot sew much during the day on account of the children who require the utmost attention I am obliged therefore to devote the evenings to this business Write to me often very long letters It will do both of us good This place is far better than but God knows I have enough to do to keep a good heart in the matter What you said has cheered me a little I wish I could always act according to your advice Home sickness affects me sorely I like Mr extremely The children are over indulged and consequently hard at times to manage Do do do come and see me if it be a breach of etiquette never mind If you can only stop an hour come Talk no more about my forsaking you my darling I could not afford to do it I find it is not in my nature to get on in this weary world without sympathy and attachment in some quarter and seldom indeed do we find it It is too great a treasure to be ever wantonly thrown away when once secured Miss Bront had not been many weeks in her new situation before she had a proof of the kind hearted hospitality of her employers Mr wrote to her father and urgently invited him to come and make acquaintance with his daughter s new home by spending a week with her in it and Mrs expressed great regret when one of Miss Bront s friends drove up to the house to leave a letter or parcel without entering So she found that all her friends might freely visit her and that her father would be received with especial gladness She thankfully acknowledged this kindness in writing to urge her friend afresh to come and see her which she accordingly did June You can hardly fancy it possible I dare say that I cannot find a quarter of an hour to scribble a note in but so it is and when a note is written it has to be carried a mile to the post and that consumes nearly an hour which is a large portion of the day Mr and Mrs have been gone a week I heard from them this morning No time is fixed for their return but I hope it will not be delayed long or I shall miss the chance of seeing Anne this vacation She came home I understand last Wednesday and is only to be allowed three weeks vacation because the family she is with are going to Scarborough I should like to see her to judge for myself of the state of her health I dare not trust any other person s report no one seems minute enough in their observations I should very much have liked you to have seen her I have got on very well with the servants and children so far yet it is dreary solitary work You can tell as well as me the lonely feeling of being without a companion Soon after this was written Mr and Mrs returned in time to allow Charlotte to go and look after Anne s health which as she found to her intense anxiety was far from strong What could she do to nurse and cherish up this little sister the youngest of them all Apprehension about her brought up once more the idea of keeping a school If by this means they three could live together and maintain themselves all might go well They would have some time of their own in which to try again and yet again at that literary career which in spite of all baffling difficulties was never quite set aside as an ultimate object but far the strongest motive with Charlotte was the conviction that Anne s health was so delicate that it required a degree of tending which none but her sister could give Thus she wrote during those midsummer holidays Haworth July th We waited long and anxiously for you on the Thursday that you promised to come I quite wearied my eyes with watching from the window eye glass in hand and sometimes spectacles on nose However you are not to blame and as to disappointment why all must suffer disappointment at some period or other of their lives But a hundred things I had to say to you will now be forgotten and never said There is a project hatching in this house which both Emily and I anxiously wished to discuss with you The project is yet in its infancy hardly peeping from its shell and whether it will ever come out a fine full fledged chicken or will turn addle and die before it cheeps is one of those considerations that are but dimly revealed by the oracles of futurity Now don t be nonplussed by all this metaphorical mystery I talk of a plain and everyday occurrence though in Delphic style I wrap up the information in figures of speech concerning eggs chickens etceatera etcaeterorum To come to the point Papa and aunt talk by fits and starts of our id est Emily Anne and myself commencing a school I have often you know said how much I wished such a thing but I never could conceive where the capital was to come from for making such a speculation I was well aware indeed that aunt had money but I always considered that she was the last person who would offer a loan for the purpose in question A loan however she has offered or rather intimates that she perhaps will offer in case pupils can be secured an eligible situation obtained c This sounds very fair but still there are matters to be considered which throw something of a damp upon the scheme I do not expect that aunt will sink more than l in such a venture and would it be possible to establish a respectable not by any means a showy school and to commence housekeeping with a capital of only that amount Propound the question to your sister if you think she can answer it if not don t say a word on the subject As to getting into debt that is a thing we could none of us reconcile our mind to for a moment We do not care how modest how humble our commencement be so it be made on sure grounds and have a safe foundation In thinking of all possible and impossible places where we could establish a school I have thought of Burlington or rather of the neighbourhood of Burlington Do you remember whether there was any other school there besides that of Miss This is of course a perfectly crude and random idea There are a hundred reasons why it should be an impracticable one We have no connections no acquaintances there it is far from home c Still I fancy the ground in the East Riding is less fully occupied than in the West Much inquiry and consideration will be necessary of course before any place is decided on and I fear much time will elapse before any plan is executed Write as soon as you can I shall not leave my present situation till my future prospects assume a more fixed and definite aspect A fortnight afterwards we see that the seed has been sown which was to grow up into a plan materially influencing her future life August th This is Saturday evening I have put the children to bed now I am going to sit down and answer your letter I am again by myself housekeeper and governess for Mr and Mrs are staying at To speak truth though I am solitary while they are away it is still by far the happiest part of my time The children are under decent control the servants are very observant and attentive to me and the occasional absence of the master and mistress relieves me from the duty of always endeavouring to seem cheerful and conversable Martha it appears is in the way of enjoying great advantages so is Mary for you will be surprised to hear that she is returning immediately to the Continent with her brother not however to stay there but to take a month s tour and recreation I have had a long letter from Mary and a packet containing a present of a very handsome black silk scarf and a pair of beautiful kid gloves bought at Brussels Of course I was in one sense pleased with the gift pleased that they should think of me so far off amidst the excitements of one of the most splendid capitals of Europe and yet it felt irksome to accept it I should think Mary and Martha have not more than sufficient pocket money to supply themselves I wish they had testified their regard by a less expensive token Mary s letters spoke of some of the pictures and cathedrals she had seen pictures the most exquisite cathedrals the most venerable I hardly know what swelled to my throat as I read her letter such a vehement impatience of restraint and steady work such a strong wish for wings wings such as wealth can furnish such an urgent thirst to see to know to learn something internal seemed to expand bodily for a minute I was tantalised by the consciousness of faculties unexercised then all collapsed and I despaired My dear I would hardly make that confession to any one but yourself and to you rather in a letter than viv voce These rebellious and absurd emotions were only momentary I quelled them in five minutes I hope they will not revive for they were acutely painful No further steps have been taken about the project I mentioned to you nor probably will be for the present but Emily and Anne and I keep it in view It is our polar star and we look to it in all circumstances of despondency I begin to suspect I am writing in a strain which will make you think I am unhappy This is far from being the case on the contrary I know my place is a favourable one for a governess What dismays and haunts me sometimes is a conviction that I have no natural knack for my vocation If teaching only were requisite it would be smooth and easy but it is the living in other people s houses the estrangement from one s real character the adoption of a cold rigid apathetic exterior that is painful You will not mention our school project at present A project not actually commenced is always uncertain Write to me often my dear Nell you know your letters are valued Your loving child as you choose to call me so C B P S I am well in health don t fancy I am not but I have one aching feeling at my heart I must allude to it though I had resolved not to It is about Anne she has so much to endure far far more than I ever had When my thoughts turn to her they always see her as a patient persecuted stranger I know what concealed susceptibility is in her nature when her feelings are wounded I wish I could be with her to administer a little balm She is more lonely less gifted with the power of making friends even than I am drop the subject She could bear much for herself but she could not patiently bear the sorrows of others especially of her sisters and again of the two sisters the idea of the little gentle youngest suffering in lonely patience was insupportable to her Something must be done No matter if the desired end were far away all time was lost in which she was not making progress however slow towards it To have a school was to have some portion of daily leisure uncontrolled but by her own sense of duty it was for the three sisters loving each other with so passionate an affection to be together under one roof and yet earning their own subsistence above all it was to have the power of watching over these two whose life and happiness were ever to Charlotte far more than her own But no trembling impatience should lead her to take an unwise step in haste She inquired in every direction she could as to the chances which a new school might have of success In all there seemed more establishments like the one which the sisters wished to set up than could be supported What was to be done Superior advantages must be offered But how They themselves abounded in thought power and information but these are qualifications scarcely fit to be inserted in a prospectus Of French they knew something enough to read it fluently but hardly enough to teach it in competition with natives or professional masters Emily and Anne had some knowledge of music but here again it was doubtful whether without more instruction they could engage to give lessons in it Just about this time Miss W was thinking of relinquishing her school at Dewsbury Moor and offered to give it up in favour of her old pupils the Bront s A sister of hers had taken the active management since the time when Charlotte was a teacher but the number of pupils had diminished and if the Bront s undertook it they would have to try and work it up to its former state of prosperity This again would require advantages on their part which they did not at present possess but which Charlotte caught a glimpse of She resolved to follow the clue and never to rest till she had reached a successful issue With the forced calm of a suppressed eagerness that sends a glow of desire through every word of the following letter she wrote to her aunt thus Dear Aunt Sept th I have heard nothing of Miss W yet since I wrote to her intimating that I would accept her offer I cannot conjecture the reason of this long silence unless some unforeseen impediment has occurred in concluding the bargain Meantime a plan has been suggested and approved by Mr and Mrs the father and mother of her pupils and others which I wish now to impart to you My friends recommend me if I desire to secure permanent success to delay commencing the school for six months longer and by all means to contrive by hook or by crook to spend the intervening time in some school on the continent They say schools in England are so numerous competition so great that without some such step towards attaining superiority we shall probably have a very hard struggle and may fail in the end They say moreover that the loan of l which you have been so kind as to offer us will perhaps not be all required now as Miss W will lend us the furniture and that if the speculation is intended to be a good and successful one half the sum at least ought to be laid out in the manner I have mentioned thereby insuring a more speedy repayment both of interest and principal I would not go to France or to Paris I would go to Brussels in Belgium The cost of the journey there at the dearest rate of travelling would be l living is there little more than half as dear as it is in England and the facilities for education are equal or superior to any other place in Europe In half a year I could acquire a thorough familiarity with French I could improve greatly in Italian and even get a dash of German i e providing my health continued as good as it is now Mary is now staying at Brussels at a first rate establishment there I should not think of going to the Ch teau de Kokleberg where she is resident as the terms are much too high but if I wrote to her she with the assistance of Mrs Jenkins the wife of the British Chaplain would be able to secure me a cheap decent residence and respectable protection I should have the opportunity of seeing her frequently she would make me acquainted with the city and with the assistance of her cousins I should probably be introduced to connections far more improving polished and cultivated than any I have yet known These are advantages which would turn to real account when we actually commenced a school and if Emily could share them with me we could take a footing in the world afterwards which we can never do now I say Emily instead of Anne for Anne might take her turn at some future period if our school answered I feel certain while I am writing that you will see the propriety of what I say You always like to use your money to the best advantage You are not fond of making shabby purchases when you do confer a favour it is often done in style and depend upon it l or l thus laid out would be well employed Of course I know no other friend in the world to whom I could apply on this subject except yourself I feel an absolute conviction that if this advantage were allowed us it would be the making of us for life Papa will perhaps think it a wild and ambitious scheme but who ever rose in the world without ambition When he left Ireland to go to Cambridge University he was as ambitious as I am now I want us all to get on I know we have talents and I want them to be turned to account I look to you aunt to help us I think you will not refuse I know if you consent it shall not be my fault if you ever repent your kindness This letter was written from the house in which she was residing as governess It was some little time before an answer came Much had to be talked over between the father and aunt in Haworth Parsonage At last consent was given Then and not till then she confided her plan to an intimate friend She was not one to talk over much about any project while it remained uncertain to speak about her labour in any direction while its result was doubtful Nov nd Now let us begin to quarrel In the first place I must consider whether I will commence operations on the defensive or the offensive The defensive I think You say and I see plainly that your feelings have been hurt by an apparent want of confidence on my part You heard from others of Miss W s overtures before I communicated them to you myself This is true I was deliberating on plans important to my future prospects I never exchanged a letter with you on the subject True again This appears strange conduct to a friend near and dear long known and never found wanting Most true I cannot give you my excuses for this behaviour this word excuse implies confession of a fault and I do not feel that I have been in fault The plain fact is I was not I am not now certain of my destiny On the contrary I have been most uncertain perplexed with contradictory schemes and proposals My time as I have often told you is fully occupied yet I had many letters to write which it was absolutely necessary should be written I knew it would avail nothing to write to you then to say I was in doubt and uncertainty hoping this fearing that anxious eagerly desirous to do what seemed impossible to be done When I thought of you in that busy interval it was to resolve that you should know all when my way was clear and my grand end attained If I could I would always work in silence and obscurity and let my efforts be known by their results Miss W did most kindly propose that I should come to Dewsbury Moor and attempt to revive the school her sister had relinquished She offered me the use of her furniture At first I received the proposal cordially and prepared to do my utmost to bring about success but a fire was kindled in my very heart which I could not quench I so longed to increase my attainments to become something better than I am a glimpse of what I felt I showed to you in one of my former letters only a glimpse Mary cast oil upon the flames encouraged me and in her own strong energetic language heartened me on I longed to go to Brussels but how could I get there I wished for one at least of my sisters to share the advantage with me I fixed on Emily She deserved the reward I knew How could the point be managed In extreme excitement I wrote a letter home which carried the day I made an appeal to aunt for assistance which was answered by consent Things are not settled yet it is sufficient to say we have a chance of going for half a year Dewsbury Moor is relinquished Perhaps fortunately so In my secret soul I believe there is no cause to regret it My plans for the future are bounded to this intention if I once get to Brussels and if my health is spared I will do my best to make the utmost of every advantage that shall come within my reach When the half year is expired I will do what I can Believe me though I was born in April the month of cloud and sunshine I am not changeful My spirits are unequal and sometimes I speak vehemently and sometimes I say nothing at all but I have a steady regard for you and if you will let the cloud and shower pass by be sure the sun is always behind obscured but still existing At Christmas she left her situation after a parting with her employers which seems to have affected and touched her greatly They only made too much of me was her remark after leaving this family I did not deserve it All four children hoped to meet together at their father s house this December Branwell expected to have a short leave of absence from his employment as a clerk on the Leeds and Manchester Railway in which he had been engaged for five months Anne arrived before Christmas day She had rendered herself so valuable in her difficult situation that her employers vehemently urged her to return although she had announced her resolution to leave them partly on account of the harsh treatment she had received and partly because her stay at home during her sisters absence in Belgium seemed desirable when the age of the three remaining inhabitants of the parsonage was taken into consideration After some correspondence and much talking over plans at home it seemed better in consequence of letters which they received from Brussels giving a discouraging account of the schools there that Charlotte and Emily should go to an institution at Lille in the north of France which was highly recommended by Baptist Noel and other clergymen Indeed at the end of January it was arranged that they were to set off for this place in three weeks under the escort of a French lady then visiting in London The terms were l each pupil for board and French alone but a separate room was to be allowed for this sum without this indulgence it was lower Charlotte writes January th I consider it kind in aunt to consent to an extra sum for a separate room We shall find it a great privilege in many ways I regret the change from Brussels to Lille on many accounts chiefly that I shall not see Martha Mary has been indefatigably kind in providing me with information She has grudged no labour and scarcely any expense to that end Mary s price is above rubies I have in fact two friends you and her staunch and true in whose faith and sincerity I have as strong a belief as I have in the Bible I have bothered you both you especially but you always get the tongs and heap coals of fire upon my head I have had letters to write lately to Brussels to Lille and to London I have lots of chemises nightgowns pocket handkerchiefs and pockets to make besides clothes to repair I have been every week since I came home expecting to see Branwell and he has never been able to get over yet We fully expect him however next Saturday Under these circumstances how
