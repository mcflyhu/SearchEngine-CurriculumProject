Franchita is alone at home ill and in bed at the end of a November day And it is the third autumn since her son s departure In her hands burning with fever she holds a letter from him a letter which should have brought only joy without a cloud since it announces his return but which causes in her on the contrary tormented sentiments for the happiness of seeing him again is poisoned now by sadness by worry especially by frightful worry Oh she had an exact presentiment of the sombre future that night when returning from escorting him on the road to departure she returned to her house with so much anguish after that sort of defiance hurled at Dolores on the street it was cruelly true that she had broken then forever her son s life Months of waiting and of apparent calm had followed that scene while Ramuntcho far from his native land was beginning his military service Then one day a wealthy suitor had presented himself for Gracieuse and she to the entire village s knowledge had rejected him obstinately in spite of Dolores s will Then they had suddenly gone away the mother and the daughter pretexting a visit to relatives in the highland but the voyage had been prolonged a mystery more and more singular had enveloped this absence and suddenly the rumor had come that Gracieuse was a novice among the sisters of Saint Mary of the Rosary in a convent of Gascony where the former Mother Superior of Etchezar was the abbess Dolores had reappeared alone in her home mute with a desolate and evil air None knew what influence had been exercised over the little girl with the golden hair nor how the luminous doors of life had been closed before her how she had permitted herself to be walled in that tomb but as soon as the period of novitiate had been accomplished without seeing even her brother she had taken her vows there while Ramuntcho in a far off colonial war ever distant from the post offices of France among the forests of a Southern island won the stripes of a sergeant and a military medal Franchita had been almost afraid that he would never return her son But at last he was coming back Between her fingers thin and warm she held the letter which said I start day after to morrow and I will be with you Saturday night But what would he do at his return what would he make of his life so sadly changed In his letters he had obstinately refrained from writing of this Anyway everything had turned against her The farmers her tenants had left Etchezar leaving the barn empty the house more lonely and naturally her modest income was much diminished Moreover in an imprudent investment she had lost a part of the money which the stranger had given for her son Truly she was too unskilful a mother compromising in every way the happiness of her beloved Ramuntcho or rather she was a mother upon whom justice from above fell heavily to day because of her past error And all this had vanquished her all this had hastened and aggravated the malady which the physician called too late did not succeed in checking Now therefore waiting for the return of her son she was stretched on her bed burning with fever tormented The knowledge of his guilt
