The local committee of a society for the propagation of something or other had taken possession of Canterton s library and Mrs Brocklebank was the dominant lady The amount of business done at these meetings was infinitesimal for Mrs Brocklebank and Gertrude Canterton were like battleships that kept up a perpetual booming of big guns hardly troubling to notice the splutter of suggestions fired by the lesser vessels The only person on the committee who had any idea of business was little Miss Whiffen the curate s sister She was one of those women who are all profile a busy short sighted argumentative creature who did her best to prevent Mrs Brocklebank and Gertrude Canterton from claiming the high seas as their own She fussed about like a torpedo boat launching her torpedoes and scoring hits that should have blown most battleships out of the water But Mrs Brocklebank was unsinkable and Gertrude Canterton was protected by the net of her infinite self satisfaction Whatever Miss Whiffen said they just kept on booming Sometimes they squabbled politely while old Lady Marchendale who was deaf sat and dozed in her chair They were squabbling this afternoon over a problem that strange to say had something to do with the matter in hand Miss Whiffen had contradicted Mrs Brocklebank and so they proceeded to argue Every thinking person ought to realise that there are a million more women than men in the country I wasn t questioning that Therefore the female birth rate must be higher than the male Miss Whiffen retorted with figures She was always attacking Mrs Brocklebank with statistics If you look up the records you will find that there are about a hundred and five boys born to every hundred girls That does not alter the situation Oh of course not This scheme of helping marriageable young women to emigrate Mrs Brocklebank paused and turned the big gun on Miss Whiffen I said marriageable young women Have you any objection to the term Miss Whiffen Oh not in the least But does it follow that because they marry when they get to the Colonies What follows Why children Marriages are more fruitful in a young country But are they When my married sister was home from Australia last time she told me Gertrude Canterton joined in Yes it s just the prevailing selfishness the decadence of home life Men are so much more selfish than they used to be I think the women are as bad And of course the question of population Old Lady Marchendale who had dozed off in her arm chair by the window woke up caught a few fragmental words and created a digression They ought to be made to have them by law But my dear Lady Marchendale I see her ladyship s point Every girl ought to have her own room Of course most certainly But in the matter of emigration Emigration What has emigration to do with the Shop Girls Self Help Society My dear Lady Marchendale we are discussing the scheme for sending young women to the Colonies Bless me I must have been asleep I remember Look at that lad of yours Mrs Canterton out there in the garden I m sure he has cut his hand Lady Marchendale might be rather deaf but she had unusually sharp eyes and Gertrude Canterton rising in her chair saw one of the lads employed in the home garden running across the lawn and wrapping a piece of sacking round his left hand and wrist She hurried to the window What is the matter Pennyweight Cut m wrist mum swappin the hedge How careless I will come and see what wants doing There had been First Aid classes in the village In fact Gertrude Canterton had started them Miss Whiffen and several members of the committee followed her into the garden and surrounded the lad Pennyweight who looked white and scared Take that dirty sacking away Pennyweight Don t you know such things are full of microbes It s bleedin so bad mum Let me see The lad obeyed her uncovering his wrist gingerly his face flinching The inner swathings of sacking were being soaked with blood from the steady pumping of a half severed artery Miss Whiffen made a little sibilant sound Sssf sssf dear dear A nasty cut Pennyweight hesitated between restive fright and awe of all these gentlewomen Hadn t I better go t Mr Lavender mum It does bleed Nonsense Pennyweight Miss Ronan would you mind going in and ringing for the housekeeper Tell her I want some clean linen and some hot water and boracic acid Miss Whiffen was interested but alarmed It s a cut artery We ought to compress the brachial artery Isn t it the femoral No that s in the leg You squeeze the arm just Exactly Along the inside seam of the sleeve But he has no coat on This was a poser Gertrude Canterton looked annoyed Where s your coat Pennyweight Down by t hedge mum If he had his coat on we should know just where to compress the artery No one noticed Canterton and Lynette till the man and the child were within five yards of the group What s the matter The lad faced round sharply appeared to disentangle himself from the women and to turn instinctively to Canterton Cut m wrist sir with the swap ook We must stop that bleeding He pulled out a big bandanna handkerchief passed it round the lad s arm knotted it and took a folding foot rule from his pocket Hold that just there Bob He made another knot over the rule on the inside of the arm and then twisted the extemporised tourniquet till the lad winced Hurt No sir That s stopped it Gertrude send one of the maids down to the office and tell Griggs to ride down on his bicycle for Kearton Feel funny Bob Just a bit sir Lie down flat in the shade there I ll get you a glass of grog Lynette solemn and sympathetic had stood watching her father disassociating herself from her mother and Miss Whiffen and the members of the committee Wasn t it a good thing I found daddy Bob It was miss The old ladies might have let you bleed to death mightn t they Bob looked sheepish and Gertrude Canterton called Lynette away Go to the nursery Lynette It is tea time Lynette chose to enter the house by the library window and finding old Lady Marchendale sitting there in the arm chair put up her face to be kissed She liked Lady Marchendale because she had pretty white hair and eyes that twinkled Did you see Bob s bloody hand What my dear Did you see Bob s bloody hand I can t quite hear dear Lynette put her mouth close to Lady Marchendale s ear and spoke with emphasis Did you see Bob s bloody hand Lynette you must not use such words Gertrude Canterton stood at the open window and Lady Marchendale was laughing What words mother Such words as bloody But it was bloody mother Bless the child how fresh Come and give me another kiss dear Lynette gave it with enthusiasm I do like your white hair It is not so pretty as yours my dear Now run along We are very busy She watched Lynette go nodding her head at her and smiling I am so sorry Lady Marchendale The child is such a little savage I think she s a pet You don t want to make a little prig of her do you She s so undisciplined Oh fudge What you call being savage is being healthy and natural You don t want to make the child a woman before she s been a child The gong rang for tea Eve was painting in the rosery when Mrs Brocklebank persuaded the members of the committee that she and therefore they wanted to see Mr Canterton s roses It was a purely perfunctory pilgrimage so far as Gertrude Canterton was concerned and her voice struck a note of passive disapproval I think there is much too much time and money wasted upon flowers Oh Mrs Canterton But isn t this just sweet I don t know very much about roses but I believe my husband s are supposed to be wonderful She sighted Eve stared and diverged towards her down a side path smiling with thin graciousness Miss Carfax Eve did not offer to explain her presence She supposed that Gertrude Canterton knew all about her husband s book and the illustrations that were needed You are making a study of flowers Yes That s right I hope you will find plenty of material here Mr Canterton was kind enough to let me come in and see what I could do Exactly May I see She minced round behind Eve and looked over the girl s shoulder at the sketch she had on her lap That s quite nice quite nice But what a lot of colour you have put into it There is rather a lot of colour in the garden itself Yes but I m afraid I can t see what you have put on paper Miss Whiffen was clamouring to be told the name of a certain rose Mrs Canterton Mrs Canterton Yes dear Do tell me the name of this rose I ll come and look I can t burden my memory with the names of flowers Perhaps it is labelled Everything ought to be labelled It is such a saving of time Eve smiled and turning to glance at the rose bed she was painting discovered a big woman in black hanging a large white face over the one particular rose in the garden Mrs Brocklebank had discovered Guinevere and a cherished flower that was just opening to the sunlight Mrs Brocklebank always carried a black vanity bag though it did not contain such things as mirror papier poudre violet powder hairpins and scent A notebook two or three neat twists of string a pair of scissors a mother of pearl card case pince nez and a little bottle of corn solvent that she had just bought in Basingford these were the occupants Eve saw her open the bag take out the scissors and bend over Guinevere Eve dared to intervene Excuse me but that rose must not be touched Perhaps she put her protest crudely but Mrs Brocklebank showed hauteur Indeed I believe Mr Canterton wants that flower What is it Philippa Mrs Canterton had returned and came wriggling and edging behind Eve There is rather a nice bud here and I was going to steal it but this young lady Miss Carfax Eve felt her face flushing I believe Mr Canterton wants that flower Nonsense Why there are hundreds here Take it my dear by all means take it I don t want to interfere with I insist James is absolutely foolish about his flowers He won t let me send a maid down with a basket And we had such a quarrel once about the orchid house Eve turned and went back to her stool Mrs Brocklebank s eyes followed her with solemn disapproval That s a rather forward young
