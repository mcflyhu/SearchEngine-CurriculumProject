It was a curious coincidence that Mrs Carfax should have come to the end of her white wool that night put her pins aside and left her work unfinished It was the last time that Eve heard the familiar clicking of the ivory pins for Mrs Carfax died quietly in her sleep and was found with a placid smile on her face her white hair neatly parted into two plaits and her hands lying folded on the coverlet She had died like a child dreaming and smiling in the midst of her dreams For the moment Eve was incredulous as she bent over the bed for her mother s face looked so fresh and tranquil Then the truth came to her and she stood there shocked and inarticulate trying to realise what had happened Sudden and poignant memories rose up and stung her She remembered that she had almost despised the little old lady who lay there so quietly and now in death she saw her as the child a pathetic creature who had never escaped from a futile childishness who had never known the greater anguish and the greater joys of those whose souls drink of the deep waters A great pity swept Eve away a choking compassion an inarticulate remorse She was conscious of sudden loneliness All the memories of long ago evoked by the dead face rose up and wounded her She knelt down hid her face against the pillow uttering in her heart that most human cry of Mother Canterton was strangely restless that morning Up at six he wandered about the gardens and nurseries and Lavender who came to him about some special work that had to be done in one of the glasshouses found him absent and vague The life of the day seemed in abeyance remaining poised at yesterday when the moon hung over the black ridge of the fir woods by Orchards Corner Daylight had come but Canterton was still in the moonlight sitting in that chair on the dew wet grass dreaming to be startled again by Eve s sudden presence He wondered what she had thought whether she had suspected that he had been imagining her his wife Orchards Corner their home and he the man sitting there in the moonlight while the woman he loved let down her dark hair before the mirror in their room If Lavender could not wake James Canterton breakfast and Gertrude Canterton did There were half a dozen of Gertrude s friends staying in the house serious women who had travelled with batches of pamphlets and earnest minded magazines and who could talk sociology even at breakfast Canterton came in early and found Gertrude scribbling letters at the bureau in the window None of her friends were down yet and a maid was lighting the spirit lamps under the egg boiler and the chafing dishes Oh James Yes She was sitting in a glare of light and Canterton was struck by the thinness of her neck and the way her chin poked forward She had done her hair in a hurry and it looked streaky and meagre and the colour of wet sand And this sunny morning the physical repulsion she inspired in him came as a shock to his finer nature It might be ungenerous and even shameful but he could not help considering her utter lack of feminine delicacy and the hard gaunt outlines of her face and figure I want you to take Mrs Grigg Batsby round the nurseries this morning She is such an enthusiast I ll see what time I have Do try to find time to oblige me sometimes I don t think you know how much work you make for me especially when you find some eccentric way of insulting everybody at once What do you mean Gertrude The maid had left the room and Gertrude Canterton half turned in her chair Her shoulders were wriggling and she kept fidgeting with her pen rolling it to and fro between her thumb and forefinger Can t you imagine what people say when you put up wire fences and have the gates locked on the day of our garden party Do you think that Whiteley would hold a party in his business premises Oh don t be so absurd I wonder why people come here I really don t know Certainly not to look at the flowers Then why be so eccentrically offensive Because there are always a certain number of enthusiastic ladies who like to get something for nothing I believe it is a feminine characteristic Mrs Grigg Batsby came sailing into the room gracious as a great galleon freighted with the riches of Peru She was an extremely wealthy person and her consciousness of wealth shone like a golden lustre a holy effulgence that penetrated into every corner Her money had made her important and filled her with a sort of after dinner self satisfaction She issued commands with playful regality ordered the clergy hither and thither and had a half humorous and half stately way of referring to any male thing as It My dear Mrs Batsby I have just asked James to take you round this morning The lady rustled and beamed And is It agreeable I have always heard that Its time is so precious James will be delighted Obliging thing Canterton was reserved and a little stiff I shall be ready at eleven I can give you an hour Mrs Batsby It is really a humorist Mrs Canterton That barbed wire I don t think I ever came across anything so delightfully original Gertrude frowned and screwed her shoulders I cannot see the humour But I think Mrs Batsby does I have a good many original plants on my premises Oh you wicked witty thing And original sin Yes it is still rather prevalent There was no queen s progress through the Fernhill grounds for Mrs Grigg Batsby that morning for by ten o clock her very existence had been forgotten and she was left reading the Athen um and wondering with hauteur what had become of the treacherous It Women like Mrs Grigg Batsby have a way of exacting as a right what the average man would not presume to ask as a favour That they should happen to notice anything is in itself a sufficient honour conferred upon the recipient who becomes a debtor to them in service Canterton had drifted in search of Eve had failed to find her and was posing himself with various questions when one of the under gardeners brought him a letter It had taken the man twenty minutes of hide and seek to trace Canterton s restless wanderings Just come from Orchards Corner sir The young lady brought it Miss Carfax No sir the young lady I see All right Gibbs Canterton opened the letter and stood reading it in the shade of a row of cypresses Dear Mr Canterton Mother died in the night She must have died in her sleep I always knew it might happen but I never suspected that it would happen so suddenly It has numbed me and yet made me think I wanted you to know why I did not come to day Eve Carfax Canterton stood stock still his eyes staring at Eve s letter He was moved strongly moved as all big hearted people must be by the sudden and capricious presence of Death The little white haired chattering figure had seemed so much alive the night before so far from the dark waters with her child s face and busy hands And Eve had written to tell him the news to warn him why she had not come to Fernhill This letter of hers it asked nothing and yet its very muteness craved more than any words could ask To Canterton it was full of many subtle and intimate messages She wanted him to know why she had stayed away though she did not ask him to come to her She had let him know that she was stricken and that was all He put the letter in his pocket forgot about Mrs Grigg Batsby and started for Orchards Corner All the blinds were down and the little house had a blank and puzzled look The chair that he had used the previous night still stood in the middle of one of the lawns Canterton opened and closed the gate noiselessly and walked up the gravel path Eve herself came to the door He had had a feeling that she had expected him to come to her and when he looked into her eyes he knew that he had not been wrong She was pale and quite calm though her eyes looked darker and more mysterious Will you come in There was no hesitation no formalism Each seemed to be obeying an inevitable impulse Canterton remained silent Eve opened the door of the drawing room and he followed her She sat down on one of the green plush chairs and the dim light seemed part of the silence I thought you might come Of course I came He put his hat on the round table Eve glanced round the room at the pictures the furniture and the ornaments I have been sitting here in this room I came in here because I realised what a ghastly prig I have been at times I wanted to be hurt and hurt badly Isn t it wonderful how death strips off one s conceit He leant forward with his elbows on his knees a listener one who understood How I used to hate these things and to sneer at them I called them Victorian and felt superior Tell me what right have we ever to feel superior We are all guilty of that Guilty of despising other colour schemes that don t tone with ours I suppose each generation is more or less colour blind in its sympathies Why she was just a child just a child that had never grown up and these were her toys Oh I understand it now I understood it when I looked at her child s face as she lay dead The curse of being one of the clever little people You are not that She lay back and covered her eyes with her hands It was a still grief the grief of a pride that humbles itself and makes no mere empty outcry Canterton watched her still as a statue But his eyes and mouth were alive and within him the warm blood seemed to mount and tremble in his throat I think she was quite happy Did I do very much She was very proud of you in her way I could see that Don t You are making things too deep too difficult You say She was just a child Her hands dropped from her face Yes Your moods passed over her and were not noticed Some people are not conscious of clouds She mused Yes but that does not make me feel less guilty It might make you feel less bitter regret Canterton sat back in his chair spreading his shoulders and drawing in a deep breath Have you wired to your relatives They don t exist Father was an only son and mother had only one brother He is a doctor in a colliery town and one of the unlucky mortals It would puzzle him to find the train fare He married when he was fifty and has about seven children Very well you will let me do everything He did not speak as a petitioner but as a man who was calmly claiming a most natural right She glanced at him and his eyes dominated hers But I can t bother you I can arrange everything If you will tell me what you wish what your mother would have wished It will have to be very quiet You see we I understand all that Would you like Lynette to come and see you Yes oh yes I should like Lynette to come He pondered a moment staring at the carpet with its crude patterning of colours and when again he began to speak he did not raise his head to look at her Of course this will make no difference to the future I don t know Tell me exactly All mother s income dies with her I have the furniture and a little money in hand Would you live on here or take rooms She hesitated Perhaps His eyes rose to meet hers I want you to stay We can work together I m not inventing work for you It s there It has been there for the last two or three years He spoke very gently and yet some raw surface within her was touched and hurt Her mouth quivered with sensitive cynicism A woman when she is alone must get money somehow It is bitter bread that many of us have to eat I did not mean to make it taste bitter Her mouth and eyes softened instantly You No You are different And that Well And that makes it more difficult in a way Why should it It does She bent her head as though trying to hide her face from him He did not seem to be conscious of what was happening and of what might happen His eyes were clear and far sighted but they missed the foreground and its complex details He left his chair and came and stood by her Eve Yes Did I say one word about money Well let s have it out and the dross done with I ask you to be my illustrator colour expert garden artist call it what you like The work is there more work than you can manage I offer you five hundred a year She still hid her face from him That is preposterous But it is like you in its generosity But I Think You and I see things as no two other people see them It is an age of gardens and I am being more and more pestered by people who want to buy plants and ideas Why you and I could create some of the finest things in colour Think of it You only want a little more technical knowledge The genius is there She appealed to him with a gesture of the hand Stop let me think He walked to the window and waited Presently Eve
