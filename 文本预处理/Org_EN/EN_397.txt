Achilles Alexandrakis was arranging the fruit on his stall in front of his little shop on Clark Street It was a clear breezy morning cool for October but not cold enough to endanger the fruit that Achilles handled so deftly in his dark slender fingers As he built the oranges into their yellow pyramid and grouped about them figs and dates melons and pears and grapes and pineapples a look of content held his face This was the happiest moment of his day Already half an hour ago Alcibiades and Yaxis had departed with their pushcarts one to the north and one to the south calling antiphonally as they went in clear high voices that came fainter and fainter to Achilles among his fruit They would not return until night and then they would come with empty carts and jingling in their pockets coppers and nickels and dimes The breath of a sigh escaped Achilles s lips as he stood back surveying the stall Something very like homesickness was in his heart He had almost fancied for a minute that he was back once more in Athens He raised his eyes and gave a quick deep glance up and down the street soot and dirt and grime frowning buildings and ugly lines and overhead a meagre strip of sky Over Athens the sky hung glorious a curve of light from side to side His soul flew wide to meet it Once more he was swinging along the Street of the Winds his face lifted to the Parthenon on its Acropolis his nostrils breathing the clear air Chicago had dropped from him like a garment his soul rose and floated Athens everywhere column and cornice and long delicate lines and colour of marble and light He drew a full sweet breath Achilles moved with quick gliding step taking orders filling bags making change always with his dark eyes seeking a little wistfully something that did not come to them It was all so different this new world Achilles had been in Chicago six months now but he had not yet forgotten a dream that he had dreamed in Athens Sometimes he dreamed it still and then he wondered whether this about him were not all a dream this pushing scrambling picking hurrying choosing crowd dropping pennies and dimes into his curving palm swearing softly at slow change and flying fast from street to street It was not thus in his dream He had seen a land of new faces turned ever to the West with the light on them He had known them in his dream eager faces full of question and quick response His soul had gone out to them and musing in sunny Athens he had made ready for them Each morning when he rose he had lifted his glance to the Parthenon studying anew the straight lines that were yet not straight the mysterious dismantled beauty the mighty lift of its presence When they should question him in this new land he must not fail them They would be hungry for the beauty of the ancient world they who had no ruins of their own He knew in his heart how it would be with them the homesickness for the East all its wonder and its mystery Yes he would carry it to them He Achilles Alexandrakis should not be found wanting This new world was to give him money wealth better education for his boys a competent old age But he too had something to give in exchange He must make himself ready against the great day when he should travel down the long way of the Piraeus for the last time and set sail for America He was in America now He knew when he stopped to think that this was not a dream He had been here six months in the little shop on Clark Street but no one had yet asked him of the Parthenon Sometimes he thought that they did not know that he was Greek Perhaps if they knew that he had been in Athens had lived there all his life from a boy they would question him The day that he first thought of this he had ordered a new sign painted It bore his name in Greek characters and it was beautiful in line and colour It caused his stand to become known far and wide as the Greek Shop and within a month after it was put up his trade had doubled but no one had asked about the Parthenon He had really ceased to hope for it now He only dreamed the dream a little wistfully as he went in and out and his thought dwelt always on Athens and her beauty The images stamped so carefully on his sensitive brain became his most precious treasures Over and over he dwelt on them Ever in memory his feet climbed the steps to the Acropolis or walked beneath stately orange trees beating a soft rhythm to the sound of flute and viol For Achilles was by nature one of the lightest hearted of children In Athens his laugh had been quick to rise and fresh as the breath of rustling leaves It was only here under the sooty sky of the narrow street that his face had grown a little sad At first the days had been full of hope and the face of each newcomer had been scanned with eager eyes The fruit sold so courteously and freely was hardly more than an excuse for the opening of swift talk But the talk had never come There was the inevitable and never varying How much the passing of coin and hurrying feet Soon a chill had crept into the heart of Achilles They did not ask of Athens They did not know that he was Greek They did not care that his name was Achilles They did not see him standing there with waiting eyes He might have been a banana on its stem a fig leaf against the wall the dirt that gritted beneath their feet for all that their eyes took note Yet they were not cruel or thoughtless Sometimes there came a belated response half surprised but cordial to his gentle good day Sometimes a stranger said The day is warm or The breeze from the Lake is cool to day Then the eyes of Achilles glowed like soft stars in their places Surely now they would speak They would say Is it thus in Greece But they never spoke And the days hurried their swift feet through the long dirty streets A tall woman in spectacles was coming toward him sniffing the air a little as she moved Have you got any bananas Yes They nice He led the way into the shop and reached to the swinging bunch You like some he said encouragingly She sniffed a step nearer Too ripe decisively Yes s But here and here He twirled the bunch skilfully on its string These not ripe and these His sunny smile spread their gracious acceptableness before her She wrinkled her forehead at them Well you might as well cut me off six A pleasure madame He had seized the heavy knife Give me that one It was a large one near the centre and this one here and here When the six were selected and cut off they were the cream of the bunch She eyed him doubtfully still scowling a little Yes I ll take these The Greek bowed gravely over the coin she dropped into his palm Thank you madame It was later now and the crowd moved more slowly with longer pauses between the buyers A boy with a bag of books stopped for an apple Two children with their nurse halted a moment looking at the glowing fruit The eyes of the children were full of light and question Somewhere in their depths Achilles caught a flitting shadow of the Parthenon Then the nurse hurried them on and they too were gone He turned away with a little sigh arranging the fruit in his slow absent way Something at the side of the stall caught his eye a little movement along the board in and out through the colour and leaves He lifted a leaf to see It was a green and black caterpillar crawling with stately hunch to the back of the stall Achilles watched him with gentle eyes Then he leaned over the stall and reached out a long finger The caterpillar poised in midair remained swaying back and forth above the dark obstruction Slowly it descended and hunched itself anew along the finger It travelled up the motionless hand and reached the sleeve With a smile on his lips Achilles entered the shop He took down an empty fig box and transferred the treasure to its depths dropping in after it one or two leaves and a bit of twig He fitted the lid to the box leaving a little air and taking the pen from his desk wrote across the side in clear Greek letters Then he placed the box on the shelf behind him where the wet ink of the lettering glistened faintly in the light It was a bit of the heart of Athens prisoned there and many times through the cold and snow and bitter sleet of that winter Achilles took down the fig box and peered into its depths at a silky bit of grey cradle swung from the side of the box by its delicate
