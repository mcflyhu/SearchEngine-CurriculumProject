Leslie Branch was asleep when O Reilly returned to their room but he awoke sufficiently to listen to the latter s breathless account of the dinner party I m rattled Johnnie confessed Why that girl just bounced right into the middle of everything and and I can t bounce her out again You say she s young and PRETTY and RICH Leslie was incredulous Y yes All of that Um m Doctor Alvarado must mix a good cocktail Why Because you re drunk and delirious They don t come that way my boy When they re rich they re old and ugly I tell you this girl is young and stunning Of course she is Branch agreed soothingly Now go to sleep and don t think any more about her there s a good boy Everything will be all right in the morning Perhaps it never happened perhaps you didn t meet any woman at all The speaker yawned and turned over Don t be an ass Johnnie cried impatiently What are we going to do with a woman on our hands WE Don t divide her with me What are YOU going to do The truth is plain this Miss Evans is in love with you and you don t know it She sees in you her soul mate Well if you don t want her I want her I ll eat her medicine I ll even marry the poor old soul if she s rich O Reilly arose early the next morning and hurried down to the office of the Junta hoping that he could convince Mr Enriquez of the folly of allowing Norine Evans to have her way By the light of day Miss Evans s project seemed more hare brained than ever and he suspected that Enriquez had acquiesced in it only because of a natural inability to refuse anything to a pretty woman that was typically Cuban But his respect for Miss Evans s energy and initiative deepened when on arriving at New Street he discovered that she had forestalled him and was even then closeted with the man he had come to see Johnnie waited uneasily he was dismayed when the girl finally appeared with Enriquez in tow for the man s face was radiant It s all settled she announced at sight of O Reilly I ve speeded them up You re an early riser the latter remarked I hardly expected Enriquez broke in Such enthusiasm Such ardor She whirls a person off his feet It seems that the Junta lacks money for another expedition so I ve made up the deficit We ll be off in a week Really Then you re actually going Of course It was like a gift from Heaven Enriquez cried Our last embarrassment is removed and But Johnnie interrupted him You re crazy both of you he declared irritably Cuba is no place for an American girl I m not thinking so much about the danger of capture on the way down as the hardship after she gets there and the fact that she will be thrown among all sorts of men The elder man lifted his head Every Cuban will know who Miss Evans is and what she has done for our cause You do not seem to have a high regard for our chivalry sir There Norine was triumphant There is bound to be some danger of course Enriquez continued for the coast is well patrolled but once the expedition is landed Miss Evans will be among friends She will be as safe in our camps as if she were in her own home Don t be hateful and argumentative or I ll begin to think you re a born chaperon Miss Evans exclaimed Come Make up your mind to endure me And now you re going to help me buy my tropical outfit With a smile and a nod at Enriquez she took O Reilly s arm and bore him away In spite of his panic struck protestations that he knew less than nothing about woman s requirements she led him up town And she kept him at her side all that morning while she made her purchases then when she had loaded him down with parcels she invited him to take her to lunch The girl was so keenly alive and so delighted with the prospect of adventure that Johnnie could not long remain displeased with her She had an irresistible way about her and he soon found himself sharing her good spirits She had a healthy appetite too when O Reilly set out for his lodgings after escorting her home he walked in order to save car fare Clams consomme chicken salad French pastry and other extravagances had reduced his capital to zero The days of idle waiting that followed were trying even to one of O Reilly s philosophic habit of mind He could learn nothing about the Junta s plans and owing to his complete uncertainty he was unable to get work Leslie Branch too failed to find steady employment though he managed by the sale of an occasional column to keep them both from actual suffering His cough meanwhile grew worse day by day for the spring was late and raw As a result his spirits rose and he became the best of all possible good companions Johnnie who was becoming constantly more fond of him felt his anxiety increase in proportion to this improvement in mood it seemed to him that Branch was on the very verge of a collapse At last there came a message which brought them great joy Enriquez directed them to be in readiness to leave Jersey City at seven o clock the following morning Neither man slept much that night As they waited in the huge barn like station Enriquez appeared with Norine Evans upon his arm The girl s color was high she was tremulous with excitement Leslie Branch who saw her for the first time emitted a low whistle of surprise Glory be That goddess he cried And I called her a poor old soul When Norine took his bony bloodless hand in her warm grasp and flashed him her frank friendly smile he capitulated instantly In hyperbolical terms he strove to voice his pleasure at the meeting but he lost the thread of his thought and floundered so hopelessly among his words that Norine said laughingly Now Mr Branch bold buccaneers don t make pretty speeches Hitch up your belt and say Hello Norine I ll call you Leslie Don t call me Leslie he begged Call me often Then he beamed upon the others as if this medieval pun were both startling and original It was plain that he wholly and inanely approved of Norine Evans Enriquez was introducing a new comer now one Major Ramos a square jawed forceful Cuban who it seemed was to be in command of the expedition My duties end here Enriquez explained Major Ramos will take charge of you and you must do exactly as he directs Ask no questions for he won t answer them Do you think you can follow instructions Certainly not I sha n t even try Norine told him I m fairly bursting with curiosity at this moment Remember Ramos not a word I promise smiled the major Good by and good luck Enriquez shook hands all around then he bowed and kissed Miss Evans s fingers I shall pray that you escape all danger senorita and I shall see that Cuba remembers her debt to you When he had gone the three Americans followed their new guide through the iron gates Major Ramos proved that he knew how to obey orders even though the other members of his party did not He remained utterly deaf to Miss Evans s entreaties that he let her know something about the plans of the expedition he would not even tell her where he was taking her where the other filibusters had assembled or from what port their ship would sail He did go so far however as to explain that an inkling of the Junta s plans had leaked out and that determined efforts to upset them were being made efforts which necessitated the greatest care on his part This of course whetted the girl s curiosity but to her most artful queries he opposed a baffling silence When Philadelphia Washington then Baltimore and finally Richmond were left behind Miss Evans was in truth ready to explode and her two companions were in a similar frame of mind Major Ramos was not naturally a silent man he had all the loquacity of the Latin and all the Latin s appreciation of a pretty woman he made no secret of the fact that his orders irked him Despite his official reserve he proved himself a pleasant traveling companion and he talked freely on all but one subject He played a good game of cards too and he devoted himself with admirable courtesy to Norine s comfort It was not until the train was approaching Charleston that he finally announced Now then my first command This is the end of our journey the other members of the expedition are here But I must ask you not to talk with them or with any strangers for our friends are being watched by detectives in the employ of the Spanish minister at Washington and by United States deputy marshals One little indiscretion might ruin everything Spies Oh goody cried Miss Evans The local authorities intend to seize any vessel we try to sail on We must be careful The hotel to which Major Ramos led his guests appeared to be well filled there were many Cubans in the lobby and the air was heavy with the aroma of their strong black cigarettes As the major entered they turned interested and expectant faces toward him and they eyed his companions with frank curiosity Miss Evans became the target for more than one warmly admiring glance As for O Reilly the familiar odor of those Cuban cigarettes the snatches of Spanish conversation which he overheard awoke in him a great excitement he realized with an odd thrill that these eager dark visaged men were now his friends and comrades and that those Americans loitering watchfully among them were his enemies the spies of whom Ramos had spoken There were at least a score of the latter and all were plainly stamped with the distinctive marks of their calling That they too were interested in the latest arrivals was soon made evident by their efforts to get acquainted To Norine Evans it was all immensely exciting The attention she evoked delighted her vastly and she was almost offended when O Reilly threatened one particularly forward sleuth with a thrashing thereby ending her fun It was a strangely restless gathering The Cubans sat in groups or in pairs with their heads together smoking furiously and whispering pausing now and then to glare balefully at some detective who drew within ear shot Every hour increased the strain On the street it became known that a party of filibusters was in the city and curious townspeople came to investigate while others journeyed to the water front to stare at the big ocean going tug which had slipped into the harbor on the evening previous When they learned that she was none other than the Dauntless that most famous of Cuban blockade runners and that Dynamite Johnny O Brien himself was in command interest grew The exploits of that redoubtable mariner were familiar to the citizens of Charleston and their sympathies were quite naturally with the cause he served therefore they were disappointed to behold a revenue cutter at anchor close alongside the Dauntless Her steam was up she was ready for instant action it seemed impossible for Dynamite Johnny to get his cargo and his passengers aboard under her very nose Some imaginative person claimed to have a tip that the Dauntless intended to ram the revenue cutter and a warning to that effect appeared in the evening paper together with the rumor that a Spanish cruiser was waiting just outside the three mile limit Charleston awoke with a start and the Cuban patriots who found themselves the object of this sudden interest buzzed like flies They muttered and whispered more mysteriously than ever and consumed even greater quantities of tobacco The detectives became painfully alert To O Reilly and his two companions it seemed that the expedition had already failed Through some blunder its plans had evidently become known and all was ruined That was the worst of these Cubans they couldn t keep a secret Branch stalked the hotel lobby like a restless wraith O Reilly was furious Of the entire party Ramos alone maintained an unruffled pleasantry he spent the evening in Miss Evans s company quite oblivious to the general feeling of dismay On the next afternoon word was quietly passed to get ready and the filibusters carrying their scant hand baggage began to leave the hotel in groups followed of course by the watchful spies As the three Americans prepared for departure Norine whispered Listen Everything is all right We re not going aboard the Dauntless at all she s here as a blind Are you sure O Reilly shot her a quick glance Major Ramos himself gave that story to the news papers it s all a part of his plan I promised not to tell but I just can t help myself Gee I m having a good time Leslie Branch shook his head mournfully You may enjoy it but I don t he grumbled We ll end by being pinched and that will finish me One week in a damp cell with my lungs O Reilly whose spirits had risen magically clapped him heartily on the back crying Congratulations You re feeling better I never felt worse the other complained Nonsense That s the first kick you ve made since we hit cold weather By the time we reach Cuba you ll be nice and melancholy and your cough will be all gone Ramos led his three charges to the railroad station and into the rear coach of a south bound train where the other members of the expedition had already found seats As they climbed aboard a Secret Service agent essayed to follow them but he was stopped by a brakeman who said You can t ride in here this is a special car Some sort of a picnic party They re wops or Greeks or something Other detectives who attempted to invade the privacy of that rear coach after the train had gotten under way were also denied Meanwhile the filibusters cast restraint aside and for the first time intermingled freely Evening came then night and still the party was jerked along at the tail of the train without a hint as to its destination About midnight those who were not dozing noted that they had stopped at an obscure pine woods junction and that when the train got under way once more their own car did not move The ruse was now apparent owing to the lateness of the hour it was doubtful if any one in the forward coaches was aware that the train was lighter by one car There was a brief delay then a locomotive crept out from a siding coupled up to the standing car and drew it off upon another track Soon the excursion party was being rushed swiftly toward the coast some twenty miles away Major Ramos came down the aisle laughing and spoke to his American protege s Well what do you think of that eh Imagine the feelings of those good deputy marshals when they wake up I bet they ll rub their eyes Miss Evans bounced excitedly in her seat she clapped her hands You must have friends in high places O Reilly grinned and the Cuban agreed Yes I purposely drew attention to us in Charleston while our ship was loading She s ready and waiting for us now and by daylight we ought to be safely out to sea Meanwhile the Dauntless has weighed anchor and is steaming north followed I hope by all the revenue cutters hereabouts It was the darkest time of the night when the special train came to a stop at a bridge spanning one of the deep Southern rivers In the stream below dimly outlined in the gloom lay the Fair Play a small tramp steamer her crew were up and awake The new arrivals were hurried aboard and within a half hour she was feeling her way seaward With daylight caution gave way to haste and the rusty little tramp began to drive forward for all she was worth She cleared the three mile limit safely and then turned south Not a craft was in sight not a smudge of smoke discolored the sky line It had been a trying night for the filibusters and when the low coast line was dropped astern they began to think of sleep Breakfast of a sort was served on deck after which those favored ones who had berths sought them while their less fortunate companions stretched out wherever they could find a place Johnnie O Reilly was not one of those who slept he was too much elated Already he could see the hills of Cuba dozing behind their purple veils in fancy he felt the fierce white heat from close walled streets and scented the odors of mangly swamps He heard the ceaseless sighing of royal palms How he had hungered for it all how he had raged at his delays Cuba s spell was upon him he knew now that he loved the island and that he would never feel at rest on other soil It had seemed so small a matter to return it had seemed so easy to seek out Rosa and to save her Yet the days had grown into weeks the weeks had aged into months Well he had done his best he had never rested from the moment of Rosa s first appeal Her enemies had foiled him once but there would be no turning back this time rather a firing squad or a dungeon in Cabanas than that O Reilly had taken his bitter medicine as becomes a man he had maintained a calm if not a cheerful front but now that every throb of the propeller bore him closer to his heart s desire he felt a growing jubilation a mounting restlessness that was hard to master His pulse was pounding his breath swelled in his lungs Sleep That was for those who merely risked their lives for Cuba Hunger No food could satisfy a starving soul Rest He would never rest until he held Rosa Varona in his arms This rusty sluggish tub was standing still Into the midst of his preoccupation Norine Evans forced herself announcing breathlessly Oh but I m excited They re hoisting a cannon out of the hold and putting it together so that we can fight if we have to Now don t you wish you d stayed at home O Reilly smiled at her Good heavens no I m having the time of my life I nearly died of curiosity at first until I found Major Ramos s tongue Hm m You found it all right He appears to be completely conquered I I m afraid so the girl acknowledged with a little grimace You d think he d never seen a woman before He s very intense Very You don t expect me as your chaperon to approve of your behavior Why you ve been flirting outrageously I had to flirt a little I simply had to know what was going on But I fixed him Indeed I couldn t let him spoil my fun could I Of course not Well I put a damper on him I told him about you about us O Reilly was puzzled What do you mean he inquired You won t be angry will you When he waxed romantic I told him he had come into my life too late I confessed that I was in love with another man with you As her hearer drew back in dismay Miss Evans added quickly Oh don t be frightened that isn t half Of course you re joking Johnnie stammered Indeed I m not I thought it would discourage him but it didn t So I told him a whopper I said we were engaged The speaker tittered She was delighted with herself Engaged To be MARRIED Certainly People aren t engaged to to go fishing are they I had to tell him something he was getting positively feverish If he d kept it up I d have told him we were secretly married This may be funny the young man said stiffly but I don t see it Oh don t look so glum I m not going to hold you to it you know Why Miss Evans s bantering manner ceased and she said earnestly Doctor Alvarado told me your story and I think it is splendid I m going to help you find that little Rosa if you ll let me You were thinking about her when I came up weren t you Johnnie nodded You might talk to me about her if you care to O Reilly s voice was husky and low as he said I daren t trust myself I m afraid She s so young so sweet so beautiful and these are war times I m almost afraid to think Norine saw her companion s cheeks blanch slowly saw his laughing eyes grow grave saw the muscular brown hand upon the rail tighten until the knuckles were white impulsively she laid her palm over his Don t let yourself worry she said If money would buy her safety you could have all that I have Just be brave and true and patient and you ll find her I m sure you will And in the mean time don t mind my frivolity it s just my way You see this is my first taste of life and it has gone to my head The Spoilers The
