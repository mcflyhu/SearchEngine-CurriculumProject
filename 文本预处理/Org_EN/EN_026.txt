After her visit to Manchester she had to return to a re opening of the painful circumstances of the previous winter as the time drew near for Mr Nicholl s departure from Haworth A testimonial of respect from the parishioners was presented at a public meeting to one who had faithfully served them for eight years and he left the place and she saw no chance of hearing a word about him in the future unless it was some second hand scrap of intelligence dropped out accidentally by one of the neighbouring clergymen I had promised to pay her a visit on my return from London in June but after the day was fixed a letter came from Mr Bront saying that she was suffering from so severe an attack of influenza accompanied with such excruciating pain in the head that he must request me to defer my visit until she was better While sorry for the cause I did not regret that my going was delayed till the season when the moors would be all glorious with the purple bloom of the heather and thus present a scene about which she had often spoken to me So we agreed that I should not come to her before August or September Meanwhile I received a letter from which I am tempted to take an extract as it shows both her conception of what fictitious writing ought to be and her always kindly interest in what I was doing July th Thank you for your letter it was as pleasant as a quiet chat as welcome as spring showers as reviving as a friend s visit in short it was very like a page of Cranford A thought strikes me Do you who have so many friends so large a circle of acquaintance find it easy when you sit down to write to isolate yourself from all those ties and their sweet associations so as to be your OWN WOMAN uninfluenced or swayed by the consciousness of how your work may affect other minds what blame or what sympathy it may call forth Does no luminous cloud ever come between you and the severe Truth as you know it in your own secret and clear seeing soul In a word are you never tempted to make your characters more amiable than the Life by the inclination to assimilate your thoughts to the thoughts of those who always FEEL kindly but sometimes fail to SEE justly Don t answer the question it is not intended to be answered Your account of Mrs Stowe was stimulatingly interesting I long to see you to get you to say it and many other things all over again My father continues better I am better too but to day I have a headache again which will hardly let me write coherently Give my dear love to M and M dear happy girls as they are You cannot now transmit my message to F and J I prized the little wild flower not that I think the sender cares for me she DOES not and CANNOT for she does not know me but no matter In my reminiscences she is a person of a certain distinction I think hers a fine little nature frank and of genuine promise I often see her as she appeared stepping supreme from the portico towards the carriage that evening we went to see Twelfth Night I believe in J s future I like what speaks in her movements and what is written upon her face Towards the latter end of September I went to Haworth At the risk of repeating something which I have previously said I will copy out parts of a letter which I wrote at the time It was a dull drizzly Indian inky day all the way on the railroad to Keighley which is a rising wool manufacturing town lying in a hollow between hills not a pretty hollow but more what the Yorkshire people call a bottom or botham I left Keighley in a car for Haworth four miles off four tough steep scrambling miles the road winding between the wavelike hills that rose and fell on every side of the horizon with a long illimitable sinuous look as if they were a part of the line of the Great Serpent which the Norse legend says girdles the world The day was lead coloured the road had stone factories alongside of it grey dull coloured rows of stone cottages belonging to these factories and then we came to poor hungry looking fields stone fences everywhere and trees nowhere Haworth is a long straggling village one steep narrow street so steep that the flag stones with which it is paved are placed end ways that the horses feet may have something to cling to and not slip down backwards which if they did they would soon reach Keighley But if the horses had cats feet and claws they would do all the better Well we the man horse car and I clambered up this street and reached the church dedicated to St Autest who was he then we turned off into a lane on the left past the curate s lodging at the Sexton s past the school house up to the Parsonage yard door I went round the house to the front door looking to the church moors everywhere beyond and above The crowded grave yard surrounds the house and small grass enclosure for drying clothes I don t know that I ever saw a spot more exquisitely clean the most dainty place for that I ever saw To be sure the life is like clock work No one comes to the house nothing disturbs the deep repose hardly a voice is heard you catch the ticking of the clock in the kitchen or the buzzing of a fly in the parlour all over the house Miss Bront sits alone in her parlour breakfasting with her father in his study at nine o clock She helps in the housework for one of their servants Tabby is nearly ninety and the other only a girl Then I accompanied her in her walks on the sweeping moors the heather bloom had been blighted by a thunder storm a day or two before and was all of a livid brown colour instead of the blaze of purple glory it ought to have been Oh those high wild desolate moors up above the whole world and the very realms of silence Home to dinner at two Mr Bront has his dinner sent into him All the small table arrangements had the same dainty simplicity about them Then we rested and talked over the clear bright fire it is a cold country and the fires were a pretty warm dancing light all over the house The parlour had been evidently refurnished within the last few years since Miss Bront s success has enabled her to have a little more money to spend Everything fits into and is in harmony with the idea of a country parsonage possessed by people of very moderate means The prevailing colour of the room is crimson to make a warm setting for the cold grey landscape without There is her likeness by Richmond and an engraving from Lawrence s picture of Thackeray and two recesses on each side of the high narrow old fashioned mantelpiece filled with books books given to her books she has bought and which tell of her individual pursuits and tastes NOT standard books She cannot see well and does little beside knitting The way she weakened her eyesight was this When she was sixteen or seventeen she wanted much to draw and she copied niminipimini copper plate engravings out of annuals stippling don t the artists call it every little point put in till at the end of six months she had produced an exquisitely faithful copy of the engraving She wanted to learn to express her ideas by drawing After she had tried to DRAW stories and not succeeded she took the better mode of writing but in so small a hand that it is almost impossible to decipher what she wrote at this time But now to return to our quiet hour of rest after dinner I soon observed that her habits of order were such that she could not go on with the conversation if a chair was out of its place everything was arranged with delicate regularity We talked over the old times of her childhood of her elder sister s Maria s death just like that of Helen Burns in Jane Eyre of those strange starved days at school of the desire almost amounting to illness of expressing herself in some way writing or drawing of her weakened eyesight which prevented her doing anything for two years from the age of seventeen to nineteen of her being a governess of her going to Brussels whereupon I said I disliked Lucy Snowe and we discussed M Paul Emanuel and I told her of s admiration of Shirley which pleased her for the character of Shirley was meant for her sister Emily about whom she is never tired of talking nor I of listening Emily must have been a remnant of the Titans great grand daughter of the giants who used to inhabit earth One day Miss Bront brought down a rough common looking oil painting done by her brother of herself a little rather prim looking girl of eighteen and the two other sisters girls of sixteen and fourteen with cropped hair and sad dreamy looking eyes Emily had a great dog half mastiff half bull dog so savage etc This dog went to her funeral walking side by side with her father and then to the day of its death it slept at her room door snuffing under it and whining every morning We have generally had another walk before tea which is at six at half past eight prayers and by nine all the household are in bed except ourselves We sit up together till ten or past and after I go I hear Miss Bront comedown and walk up and down the room for an hour or so Copying this letter has brought the days of that pleasant visit very clear before me very sad in their clearness We were so happy together we were so full of interest in each other s subjects The day seemed only too short for what we had to say and to hear I understood her life the better for seeing the place where it had been spent where she had loved and suffered Mr Bront was a most courteous host and when he was with us at breakfast in his study or at tea in Charlotte s parlour he had a sort of grand and stately way of describing past times which tallied well with his striking appearance He never seemed quite to have lost the feeling that Charlotte was a child to be guided and ruled when she was present and she herself submitted to this with a quiet docility that half amused half astonished me But when she had to leave the room then all his pride in her genius and fame came out He eagerly listened to everything I could tell him of the high admiration I had at any time heard expressed for her works He would ask for certain speeches over and over again as if he desired to impress them on his memory I remember two or three subjects of the conversations which she and I held in the evenings besides those alluded to in my letter I asked her whether she had ever taken opium as the description given of its effects in Villette was so exactly like what I had experienced vivid and exaggerated presence of objects of which the outlines were indistinct or lost in golden mist etc She replied that she had never to her knowledge taken a grain of it in any shape but that she had followed the process she always adopted when she had to describe anything which had not fallen within her own experience she had thought intently on it for many and many a night before falling to sleep wondering what it was like or how it would be till at length sometimes after the progress of her story had been arrested at this one point for weeks she wakened up in the morning with all clear before her as if she had in reality gone through the experience and then could describe it word for word as it had happened I cannot account for this psychologically I only am sure that it was so because she said it She made many inquiries as to Mrs Stowe s personal appearance and it evidently harmonised well with some theory of hers to hear that the author of Uncle Tom s Cabin was small and slight It was another theory of hers that no mixtures of blood produced such fine characters mentally and morally as the Scottish and English I recollect too her saying how acutely she dreaded a charge of plagiarism when after she had written Jane Eyre she read the thrilling effect of the mysterious scream at midnight in Mrs Marsh s story of the Deformed She also said that when she read the Neighbours she thought every one would fancy that she must have taken her conception of Jane Eyre s character from that of Francesca the narrator of Miss Bremer s story For my own part I cannot see the slightest resemblance between the two characters and so I told her but she persisted in saying that Francesca was Jane Eyre married to a good natured Bear of a Swedish surgeon We went not purposely but accidentally to see various poor people in our distant walks From one we had borrowed an umbrella in the house of another we had taken shelter from a rough September storm In all these cottages her quiet presence was known At three miles from her home the chair was dusted for her with a kindly Sit ye down Miss Bront and she knew what absent or ailing members of the family to inquire after Her quiet gentle words few though they might be were evidently grateful to those Yorkshire ears Their welcome to her though rough and curt was sincere and hearty We talked about the different courses through which life ran She said in her own composed manner as if she had accepted the theory as a fact that she believed some were appointed beforehand to sorrow and much disappointment that it did not fall to the lot of all as Scripture told us to have their lines fall in pleasant places that it was well for those who had rougher paths to perceive that such was God s will concerning them and try to moderate their expectations leaving hope to those of a different doom and seeking patience and resignation as the virtues they were to cultivate I took a different view I thought that human lots were more equal than she imagined that to some happiness and sorrow came in strong patches of light and shadow so to speak while in the lives of others they were pretty equally blended throughout She smiled and shook her head and said she was trying to school herself against ever anticipating any pleasure that it was better to be brave and submit faithfully there was some good reason which we should know in time why sorrow and disappointment were to be the lot of some on earth It was better to acknowledge this and face out the truth in a religious faith In connection with this conversation she named a little abortive plan which I had not heard of till then how in the previous July she had been tempted to join some friends a married couple and their child in an excursion to Scotland They set out joyfully she with especial gladness for Scotland was a land which had its roots deep down in her imaginative affections and the glimpse of two days at Edinburgh was all she had as yet seen of it But at the first stage after Carlisle the little yearling child was taken with a slight indisposition the anxious parents fancied that strange diet disagreed with it and hurried back to their Yorkshire home as eagerly as two or three days before they had set their faces northward in hopes of a month s pleasant ramble We parted with many intentions on both sides of renewing very frequently the pleasure we had had in being together We agreed that when she wanted bustle or when I wanted quiet we were to let each other know and exchange visits as occasion required I was aware that she had a great anxiety on her mind at this time and being acquainted with its nature I could not but deeply admire the patient docility which she displayed in her conduct towards her father Soon after I left Haworth she went on a visit to Miss Wooler who was then staying at Hornsea The time passed quietly and happily with this friend whose society was endeared to her by every year To Miss WOOLER Dec th I wonder how you are spending these long winter evenings Alone probably like me The thought often crosses me as I sit by myself how pleasant it would be if you lived within a walking distance and I could go to you sometimes or have you to come and spend a day and night with me Yes I did enjoy that week at Hornsea and I look forward to spring as the period when you will fulfil your promise of coming to visit me I fear you must be very solitary at Hornsea How hard to some people of the world it would seem to live your life how utterly impossible to live it with a serene spirit and an unsoured disposition It seems wonderful to me because you are not like Mrs phlegmatic and impenetrable but received from nature feelings of the very finest edge Such feelings when they are locked up sometimes damage the mind and temper They don t with you It must be partly principle partly self discipline which keeps you as you are Of course as I draw nearer to the years so recently closed it becomes impossible for me to write with the same fulness of detail as I have hitherto not felt it wrong to use Miss Bront passed the winter of in a solitary and anxious manner But the great conqueror Time was slowly achieving his victory over strong prejudice and human resolve By degrees Mr Bront became reconciled to the idea of his daughter s marriage There is one other letter addressed to Mr Dobell which developes the intellectual side of her character before we lose all thought of the authoress in the timid and conscientious woman about to become a wife and in the too short almost perfect happiness of her nine months of wedded life Haworth near Keighley Feb rd My dear Sir I can hardly tell you how glad I am to have an opportunity of explaining that taciturnity to which you allude Your letter came at a period of danger and care when my father was very ill and I could not leave his bedside I answered no letters at that time and yours was one of three or four that when leisure returned to me and I came to consider their purport it seemed to me such that the time was past for answering them and I laid them finally aside If you remember you asked me to go to London it was too late either to go or to decline I was sure you had left London One circumstance you mentioned your wife s illness which I have thought of many a time and wondered whether she is better In your present note you do not refer to her but I trust her health has long ere now been quite restored Balder arrived safely I looked at him before cutting his leaves with singular pleasure Remembering well his elder brother the potent Roman it was natural to give a cordial welcome to a fresh scion of the same house and race I have read him He impressed me thus he teems with power I found in him a wild wealth of life but I thought his favourite and favoured child would bring his sire trouble would make his heart ache It seemed to me that his strength and beauty were not so much those of Joseph the pillar of Jacob s age as of the Prodigal Son who troubled his father though he always kept his love How is it that while the first born of genius often brings honour the second as almost often proves a source of depression and care I could almost prophesy that your third will atone for any anxiety inflicted by this his immediate predecessor There is power in that character of Balder and to me a certain horror Did you mean it to embody along with force any of the special defects of the artistic character It seems to me that those defects were never thrown out in stronger lines I did not and could not think you meant to offer him as your cherished ideal of the true great poet I regarded him as a vividly coloured picture of inflated self esteem almost frantic aspiration of a nature that has made a Moloch of intellect offered up in pagan fires the natural affections sacrificed the heart to the brain Do we not all know that true greatness is simple self oblivious prone to unambitious unselfish attachments I am certain you feel this truth in your heart of hearts But if the critics err now as yet I have seen none of their lucubrations you shall one day set them right in the second part of Balder You shall show them that you too know better perhaps than they that the truly great man is too sincere in his affections to grudge a sacrifice too much absorbed in his work to talk loudly about it too intent on finding the best way to accomplish what he undertakes to think great things of himself the instrument And if God places seeming impediments in his way if his duties sometimes seem to hamper his powers he feels keenly perhaps writhes under the slow torture of hindrance and delay but if there be a true man s heart in his breast he can bear submit wait patiently Whoever speaks to me of Balder though I live too retired a life to come often in the way of comment shall be answered according to your suggestion and my own impression Equity demands that you should be your own interpreter Good bye for the present and believe me Faithfully and gratefully CHARLOTTE BRONT Sydney Dobell Esq A letter to her Brussels schoolfellow gives an idea of the external course of things during this winter March th I was very glad to see your handwriting again It is I believe a year since I heard from you Again and again you have recurred to my thoughts lately and I was beginning to have some sad presages as to the cause of your silence Your letter happily does away with all these it brings on the whole glad tidings both of your papa mama your sisters and last but not least your dear respected English self My dear father has borne the severe winter very well a circumstance for which I feel the more thankful as he had many weeks of very precarious health last summer following an attack from which he suffered in June and which for a few hours deprived him totally of sight though neither his mind speech nor even his powers of motion were in the least affected I can hardly tell you how thankful I was when after that dreary and almost despairing interval of utter darkness some gleam of daylight became visible to him once more I had feared that paralysis had seized the optic nerve A sort of mist remained for a long time and indeed his vision is not yet perfectly clear but he can read write and walk about and he preaches TWICE every Sunday the curate only reading the prayers YOU can well understand how earnestly I wish and pray that sight may be spared him to the end he so dreads the privation of blindness His mind is just as strong and active as ever and politics interest him as they do YOUR papa The Czar the war the alliance between France and England into all these things he throws himself heart and soul they seem to carry him back to his comparatively young days and to renew the excitement of the last great European struggle Of course my father s sympathies and mine too are all with Justice and Europe against Tyranny and Russia Circumstanced as I have been you will comprehend that I have had neither the leisure nor the inclination to go from home much during the past year I spent a week with Mrs Gaskell in the spring and a fortnight with some other friends more recently and that includes the whole of my visiting since I saw you last My life is indeed very uniform and retired more so than is quite healthful either for mind or body yet I find reason for often renewed feelings of gratitude in the sort of support which still comes and cheers me on from time to time My health though not unbroken is I sometimes fancy rather stronger on the whole than it was three years ago headache and dyspepsia are my worst ailments Whether I shall come up to town this season for a few days I do not yet know but if I do I shall hope to call in P Place In April she communicated the fact of her engagement to Miss Wooler Haworth April th My dear Miss Wooler The truly kind interest which you always taken in my affairs makes me feel that it is due to you to transmit an early communication on a subject respecting which I have already consulted you more than once I must tell you then that since I wrote last papa s mind has gradually come round to a view very different to that which he once took and that after some correspondence and as the result of a visit Mr Nicholls paid here about a week ago it was agreed that he was to resume the curacy of Haworth as soon as papa s present assistant is provided with a situation and in due course of time he is to be received as an inmate into this house It gives me unspeakable content to see that now my father has once admitted this new view of the case he dwells on it very complacently In all arrangements his convenience and seclusion will be scrupulously respected Mr Nicholls seems deeply to feel the wish to comfort and sustain his declining years I think from Mr Nicholls character I may depend on this not being a mere transitory impulsive feeling but rather that it will be accepted steadily as a duty and discharged tenderly as an office of affection The destiny which Providence in His goodness and wisdom seems to offer me will not I am aware be generally regarded as brilliant but I trust I see in it some germs of real happiness I trust the demands of both feeling and duty will be in some measure reconciled by the step in contemplation It is Mr Nicholls wish that the marriage should take place this summer he urges the month of July but that seems very soon When you write to me tell me how you are I have now decidedly declined the visit to London the ensuing three months will bring me abundance of occupation I could not afford to throw away a month Papa has just got a letter from the good and dear bishop which has touched and pleased us much it expresses so cordial an approbation of Mr Nicholls return to Haworth respecting which he was consulted and such kind gratification at the domestic arrangements which are to ensue It seems his penetration discovered the state of things when he was here in June She expressed herself in other letters as thankful to One who had guided her through much difficulty and much distress and perplexity of mind and yet she felt what most thoughtful women do who marry when the first flush of careless youth is over that there was a strange half sad feeling in making announcements of an engagement for cares and fears came mingled inextricably with hopes One great relief to her mind at this time was derived from the conviction that her father took a positive pleasure in all the thoughts about and preparations for her wedding He was anxious that things should be expedited and was much interested in every preliminary arrangement for the reception of Mr Nicholls into the Parsonage as his daughter s husband This step was rendered necessary by Mr Bront s great age and failing sight which made it a paramount obligation on so dutiful a daughter as Charlotte to devote as much time and assistance as ever in attending to his wants Mr Nicholls too hoped that he might be able to add some comfort and pleasure by his ready presence on any occasion when the old clergyman might need his services At the beginning of May Miss Bront left home to pay three visits before her marriage The first was to us She only remained three days as she had to go to the neighbourhood of Leeds there to make such purchases as were required for her marriage Her preparations as she said could neither be expensive nor extensive consisting chiefly in a modest replenishing of her wardrobe some re papering and re painting in the Parsonage and above all converting the small flagged passage room hitherto used only for stores which was behind her sitting room into a study for her husband On this idea and plans for his comfort as well as her father s her mind dwelt a good deal and we talked them over with the same unwearying happiness which I suppose all women feel in such discussions especially when money considerations call for that kind of contrivance which Charles Lamb speaks of in his Essay on Old China as forming so great an addition to the pleasure of obtaining a thing at last Haworth May nd Since I came home I have been very busy stitching the little new room is got into order and the green and white curtains are up they exactly suit the papering and look neat and clean enough I had a letter a day or two since announcing that Mr Nicholls comes to morrow I feel anxious about him more anxious on one point than I dare quite express to myself It seems he has again been suffering sharply from his rheumatic affection I hear this not from himself but from another quarter He was ill while I was in Manchester and B He uttered no complaint to me dropped no hint on the subject Alas he was hoping he had got the better of it and I know how this contradiction of his hopes will sadden him For unselfish reasons he did so earnestly wish this complaint might not become chronic I fear I fear but if he is doomed to suffer so much the more will he need care and help Well come what may God help and strengthen both him and me I look forward to to morrow with a mixture of impatience and anxiety Mr Bront had a slight illness which alarmed her much Besides all the weight of care involved in the household preparations pressed on the bride in this case not unpleasantly only to the full occupation of her time She was too busy to unpack her wedding dresses for several days after they arrived from Halifax yet not too busy to think of arrangements by which Miss Wooler s journey to be present at the marriage could be facilitated I write to Miss Wooler to day Would it not be better dear if you and she could arrange to come to Haworth on the same day arrive at Keighley by the same train then I could order the cab to meet you at the station and bring you on with your luggage In this hot weather walking would be quite out of the question either for you or for her and I know she would persist in doing it if left to herself and arrive half killed I thought it better to mention this arrangement to you first and then if you liked it you could settle the time etc with Miss Wooler and let me know Be sure and give me timely information that I may write to the Devonshire Arms about the cab Mr Nicholls is a kind considerate fellow With all his masculine faults he enters into my wishes about having the thing done quietly in a way that makes me grateful and if nobody interferes and spoils his arrangements he will manage it so that not a soul in Haworth shall be aware of the day He is so thoughtful too about the ladies that is you and Miss Wooler Anticipating too the very arrangements I was going to propose to him about providing for your departure etc He and Mr S come to the evening before write me a note to let me know they are there precisely at eight in the morning they will be in the church and there we are to meet them Mr and Mrs Grant are asked to the breakfast not to the ceremony It was fixed that the marriage was to take place on the th of June Her two friends arrived at Haworth Parsonage the day before and the long summer afternoon and evening were spent by Charlotte in thoughtful arrangements for the morrow and for her father s comfort during her absence from home When all was finished the trunk packed the morning s breakfast arranged the wedding dress laid out just at bedtime Mr Bront announced his intention of stopping at home while the others went to church What was to be done Who was to give the bride away There were only to be the officiating clergyman the bride and bridegroom the bridesmaid and Miss Wooler present The Prayer book was referred to and there it was seen that the Rubric enjoins that the Minister shall receive the woman from her father s or FRIEND S hands and that nothing is specified as to the sex of the friend So Miss Wooler ever kind in emergency volunteered to give her old pupil away The news of the wedding had slipt abroad before the little party came out of church and many old and humble friends were there seeing her look like a snow drop as they say Her dress was white embroidered muslin with a lace mantle and white bonnet trimmed with green leaves which perhaps might suggest the resemblance to the pale wintry flower Mr Nicholls and she went to visit his friends and relations in Ireland and made a tour by Killarney Glengariff Tarbert Tralee and Cork seeing scenery of which she says some parts exceeded all I had ever imagined I must say I like my new relations My dear husband too appears in a new light in his own country More than once I have had deep pleasure in hearing his praises on all sides Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person for that I have got one of the best gentlemen in the country I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice and I pray to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful honourable man Henceforward the sacred doors of home are closed upon her married life We her loving friends standing outside caught occasional glimpses of brightness and pleasant peaceful murmurs of sound telling of the gladness within and we looked at each other and gently said After a hard and long struggle after many cares and many bitter sorrows she is tasting happiness now We thought of the slight astringencies of her character and how they would turn to full ripe sweetness in that calm sunshine of domestic peace We remembered her trials and were glad in the idea that God had seen fit to wipe away the tears from her eyes Those who saw her saw an outward change in her look telling of inward things And we thought and we hoped and we prophesied in our great love and reverence But God s ways are not as our ways Hear some of the low murmurs of happiness we who listened heard I really seem to have had scarcely a spare moment since that dim quiet June morning when you E and myself all walked down to Haworth Church Not that I have been wearied or oppressed but the fact is my time is not my own now somebody else wants a good portion of it and says we must do so and so We DO so and so accordingly and it generally seems the right thing We have had many callers from a distance and latterly some little occupation in the way of preparing for a small village entertainment Both Mr Nicholls and myself wished much to make some response for the hearty welcome and general goodwill shown by the parishioners on his return accordingly the Sunday and day scholars and teachers the church ringers singers etc to the number of five hundred were asked to tea and supper in the School room They seemed to enjoy it much and it was very pleasant to see their happiness One of the villagers in proposing my husband s health described him as a consistent Christian and a kind gentleman I own the words touched me deeply and I thought as I know YOU would have thought had you been present that to merit and win such a character was better than to earn either wealth or fame or power I am disposed to echo that high but simple eulogium My dear father was not well when we returned from Ireland I am however most thankful to say that he is better now May God preserve him to us yet for some years The wish for his continued life together with a certain solicitude for his happiness and health seems I scarcely know why even stronger in me now than before I was married Papa has taken no duty since we returned and each time I see Mr Nicholls put on gown or surplice I feel comforted to think that this marriage has secured papa good aid in his old age September th Yes I am thankful to say my husband is in improved health and spirits It makes me content and grateful to hear him from time to time avow his happiness in the brief plain phrase of sincerity My own life is more occupied than it used to be I have not so much time for thinking I am obliged to be more practical for my dear Arthur is a very practical as well as a very punctual and methodical man Every morning he is in the National School by nine o clock he gives the children religious instruction till half past ten Almost every afternoon he pays visits amongst the poor parishioners Of course he often finds a little work for his wife to do and I hope she is not sorry to help him I believe it is not bad for me that his bent should be so wholly towards matters of life and active usefulness so little inclined to the literary and contemplative As to his continued affection and kind attentions it does not become me to say much of them but they neither change nor diminish Her friend and bridesmaid came to pay them a visit in October I was to have gone also but I allowed some little obstacle to intervene to my lasting regret I say nothing about the war but when I read of its horrors I cannot help thinking that it is one of the greatest curses that ever fell upon mankind I trust it may not last long for it really seems to me that no glory to be gained can compensate for the sufferings which must be endured This may seem a little ignoble and unpatriotic but I think that as we advance towards middle age nobleness and patriotism have a different signification to us to that which we accept while young You kindly inquire after Papa He is better and seems to gain strength as the weather gets colder indeed of late years health has always been better in winter than in summer We are all indeed pretty well and for my own part it is long since I have known such comparative immunity from headache etc as during the last three months My life is different from what it used to be May God make me thankful for it I have a good kind attached husband and every day my own attachment to him grows stronger Late in the autumn Sir James Kay Shuttleworth crossed the border hills that separate Lancashire from Yorkshire and spent two or three days with them About this time Mr Nicholls was offered a living of much greater value than his curacy at Haworth and in many ways the proposal was a very advantageous one but he felt himself bound to Haworth as long as Mr Bront lived Still this offer gave his wife great and true pleasure as a proof of the respect in which her husband was held Nov I intended to have written a line yesterday but just as I was sitting down for the purpose Arthur called to me to take a walk We set off not intending to go far but though wild and cloudy it was fair in the morning when we had got about half a mile on the moors Arthur suggested the idea of the waterfall after the melted snow he said it would be fine I had often wished to see it in its winter power so we walked on It was fine indeed a perfect torrent racing over the rocks white and beautiful It began to rain while we were watching it and we returned home under a streaming sky However I enjoyed the walk inexpressibly and would not have missed the spectacle on any account She did not achieve this walk of seven or eight miles in such weather with impunity She began to shiver soon after her return home in spite of every precaution and had a bad lingering sore throat and cold which hung about her and made her thin and weak Did I tell you that our poor little Flossy is dead She drooped for a single day and died quietly in the night without pain The loss even of a dog was very saddening yet perhaps no dog ever had a happier life or an easier death On Christmas day she and her husband walked to the poor old woman whose calf she had been set to seek in former and less happy days carrying with them a great spice cake to make glad her heart On Christmas day many a humble meal in Haworth was made more plentiful by her gifts Early in the new year Mr and Mrs Nicholls went to visit Sir James Kay Shuttleworth at Gawthorpe They only remained two or three days but it so fell out that she increased her lingering cold by a long walk over damp ground in thin shoes Soon after her return she was attacked by new sensations of perpetual nausea and ever recurring faintness After this state of things had lasted for some time she yielded to Mr Nicholls wish that a doctor should be sent for He came and assigned a natural cause for her miserable indisposition a little patience and all would go right She
