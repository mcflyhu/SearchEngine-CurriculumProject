Achilles saw her and moved forward swiftly But she ignored him her eyes were on the short square man seated at the table and she came to him bending close You must pay Phil she said The words held themselves in her reddened eyes and her fingers picked a little at the lace on her dress then they trembled and reached out to him You must pay she said hoarsely But the man did not stir The woman lifted her eyes and looked at Achilles There was no recognition in the glance only a kind of impatience that he was there The Greek moved toward the door but the great man stayed him Don t go he said He reached up a hand to his wife laying it on her shoulder We can t pay dearest he said slowly Her open lips regarded him and the quick tears were in her eyes She brushed them back and looked at him Let me pay she said fiercely I will give up everything and pay She had crouched to him her groping fingers on his arm Above her head the glances of the two men met Her husband bent to her speaking very slowly to a child Listen Louie they might give her back to day if we paid but they would take her again to morrow next week next year We shall never be safe if we pay Nobody will be safe Her face was on his arm sobbing close I hate it she said brokenly I hate your money I want Betty The cry went through the room and the man was on his feet looking down at her Don t Louie he said don t dear I can t bear that See dear sit down He had placed her in the chair and was crooning to her bending to her We shall have her back soon now The telephone was whirring and he sprang to it The woman lifted her face staring at it The Greek s deep eyes fixed themselves on it The room was so still they could hear the tiny ironic words flinging themselves spitefully in the room and biting upon the air Time s up the Thing tittered Make it fifty thousand now for a day Fifty thousand down and the child delivered safe Br r r r The woman sprang forward Tell them we ll pay Phil give it to me Yes yes we ll pay She struggled a little but the hand had thrust her back and the receiver was on its hook We shall not pay said the man sternly not if they make it a million I think they make it a million said Achilles quietly They looked up at him with startled eyes They know you rich His hands flung themselves So rich They make you pay yes they make everyone pay I think His dark eyes were on the woman significantly What do you mean she said swiftly If you pay they steal them everywhere little children His eyes seemed to see them at play in the sunshine and the dark shadows stealing upon them The woman s eyes were on his face breathless They have taken Betty she said It was a broken cry We find her said Achilles simply Then little children play happy He turned to go But the woman stayed him Her face trembled to hold itself steady under his glance I want to save the children too she said I will be brave Her husband s startled face was turned to her and she smiled to it bravely Help me Phil she said She reached out her hands to him and he took them tenderly He had not been so near her for years She was looking in his face smiling still across the white line of her lip I shall help she said slowly But you must not trust me dear not too far I want my little girl There were tears in the eyes of the two men and the Greek went softly out closing the door Down the wide hallway out of the great door with its stately carvings and the two pink stone lions that guarded the way out to the clear night of stars The breeze blew in a little breath from the lake that lapped upon the breakwater and died out Achilles stood very still lifting his face to it Behind him in the city little children were asleep and in the great house the man and the woman waited alone for the help that was coming to them running with swift feet in the night It sped upon iron rails and crept beneath the ground and whispered in the air and in the heart of Achilles it dreamed under the quiet stars hoarsely adv Excuse me he said hoarsely Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross s service impatience n He expressed impatience at the slow rate of progress He gave a stamp of impatience crouched v crouch He crouched down beside her The lion crouched ready to pounce bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them sobbing lt gt adj I heard a child sobbing loudly Her eyes were red with recent sobbing fixed adj Have you two fixed on a date for the wedding yet Once the aim is fixed we should not change it arbitrarily ironic adj That is a summary and ironic end People used to call me Mr Popularity at high school but they were being ironic carvings n carving The desk was ornamented with many carvings Shell carvings are a specialty of the town
