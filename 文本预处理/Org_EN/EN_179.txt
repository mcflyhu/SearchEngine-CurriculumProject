It was some time before Terry could sleep though it was now very late When he put out the light and slipped into the bed the darkness brought a bright flood of memories of the day before him It seemed to him that half a lifetime had been crowded into the brief hours since he was fired on the ranch that morning Behind everything stirred the ugly face of Denver as a sort of controlling nemesis It seemed to him that the chunky little man had been pulling the wires all the time while he Terry Hollis danced in response Not a flattering thought Nervously Terry got out of bed and went to the window The night was cool cut crisp rather than chilling His eye went over the velvet blackness of the mountain slope above him to the ragged line of the crest then a dizzy plunge to the brightness of the stars beyond The very sense of distance was soothing it washed the gloom and the troubles away from him He breathed deep of the fragrance of the pines and then went back to his bed He had hardly taken his place in it when the sleep began to well up over his brain waves of shadows running out of corners of his mind And then suddenly he was wide awake alert Someone had opened the door There had been no sound merely a change in the air currents of the room but there was also the sense of another presence so clearly that Terry almost imagined he could hear the breathing He was beginning to shrug the thought away and smile at his own nervousness when he heard that unmistakable sound of a foot pressing the floor And then he remembered that he had left his gun belt far from the bed In a burning moment that lesson was printed in his mind and would never be forgotten Slowly as possible and without sound he drew up his feet little by little spread his arms gently on either side of him and made himself tense for the effort Whoever it was that entered they might be taken by surprise He dared not lift his head to look and he was on the verge of leaping up and at the approaching noise when a whisper came to him softly Black Jack The soft voice the name itself thrilled him He sat erect in the bed and made out dimly the form of Kate Pollard in the blackness She would have been quite invisible save that the square of the window was almost exactly behind her He made out the faint whiteness of the hand which held her dressing robe at the breast She did not start back though she showed that she was startled by the suddenness of his movement by growing the faintest shade taller and lifting her head a little Terry watched her bewildered I been waiting to see you said Kate I want to I mean to talk to you He could think of nothing except to blurt with sublime stupidity It s good of you Won t you sit down The girl brought him to his senses with a sharp Easy Don t talk out Do you know what d happen if Dad found me here I began Terry But she helped him smoothly to the logical conclusion He d blow your head off Black Jack and he d do it pronto If you are going to talk talk soft like me She sat down on the side of the bed so gently that there was no creaking They peered at each other through the darkness for a time She was not whispering but her voice was pitched almost as low and he wondered at the variety of expression she was able to pack in the small range of that murmur I suppose I m a fool for coming But I was born to love chances Born for it She lifted her head and laughed It amazed Terry to hear the shaken flow of her breath and catch the glinting outline of her face He found himself leaning forward a little and he began to wish for a light though perhaps it was an unconscious wish First she said what d you know about Dad and Denver Pete Practically nothing She was silent for a moment and he saw her hand go up and prop her chin while she considered what she could say next They s so much to tell she confessed that I can t put it short I ll tell you this much Black Jack That isn t my name if you please It ll be your name if you stay around these parts with Dad very long she replied with an odd emphasis But where you been raised Terry And what you been doing with yourself He felt that this giving of the first name was a tribute in some subtle manner It enabled him for instance to call her Kate and he decided with a thrill that he would do so at the first opportunity He reverted to her question I suppose he admitted gloomily that I ve been raised to do pretty much as I please and the money I ve spent has been given to me The girl shook her head with conviction It ain t possible she declared Why not No son of Black Jack would live off somebody s charity He felt the blood tingle in his cheeks and a real anger against her rose Yet he found himself explaining humbly You see I was taken when I wasn t old enough to decide for myself I was only a baby And I was raised to depend upon Elizabeth Cornish I I didn t even know the name of my father until a few days ago The girl gasped You didn t know your father not your own father She laughed again scornfully Terry I ain t green enough to believe that He fell into a dignified silence and presently the girl leaned closer as though she were peering to make out his face Indeed it was now possible to dimly make out objects in the room The window was filled with an increasing brightness and presently a shaft of pale light began to slide across the floor little by little The moon had pushed up above the crest of the mountain Did that make you mad queried the girl Why You seemed to doubt what I said he remarked stiffly Why not You ain t under oath or anything are you Then she laughed again You re a queer one all the way through This Elizabeth Cornish got anything to do with the Cornish ranch I presume she owns it very largely The girl nodded You talk like a book You must of studied a terrible pile Not so much really H m said the girl and seemed to reserve judgment Then she asked with a return of her former sharpness How come you gambled today at Pedro s I don t know It seemed the thing to do to kill time you know Kill time At Pedro s Well you are green Terry I suppose I am Kate He made a little pause before her name and when he spoke it in spite of himself his voice changed became softer The girl straightened somewhat and the light was now increased to such a point that he could make out that she was frowning at him through the dimness First you been adopted then you been raised on a great big place with everything you want mostly and now you re out playing at Pedro s How come Terry I was sent away said Terry faintly as all the pain of that farewell came flooding back over him Why I shot a man Ah said Kate You shot a man It seemed to silence her Why Terry He had killed my father he explained more softly than ever I know It was Minter And they turned you out for that There was a trembling intake of her breath He could catch the sparkle of her eyes and knew that she had flown into one of her sudden fiery passions And it warmed his heart to hear her I d like to know what kind of people they are anyway I d like to meet up with that Elizabeth Cornish the She s the finest woman that ever breathed said Terry simply You say that she pondered slowly after she sent you away She did only what she thought was right She s a little hard but very just Kate She was shaking her head the hair had become a dull and wonderful gold in the faint moonshine I dunno what kind of a man you are Terry I didn t ever know a man could stick by folks after they d been hurt by em I couldn t do it I ain t got much Bible stuff in me Terry Why when somebody does me a wrong I hate em I hate em And I never forgive em till I get back at em She sighed But you re different I guess I begin to figure that you re pretty white Terry Hollis There was something so direct about her talk that he could not answer It seemed to him that there was in her a cross between a boy and a man the simplicity of a child and the straightforward strength of a grown man and all this tempered and made strangely delightful by her own unique personality But I guessed it the first time I looked at you she was murmuring I guessed that you was different from the rest She had her elbow on her knee now and with her chin cupped in the graceful hand she leaned toward him and studied him When they re clean cut on the outside they re spoiled on the inside They re crooks hard ones out for themselves never giving a rap about the next gent in line But mostly they ain t even clean on the outside and you can see what they are the first time you look at em Oh I ve liked some of the boys now and then but I had to make myself like em But you re different I seen that when you started talking You didn t sulk and you didn t look proud like you wanted to show us what you could do and you didn t boast none I kept wondering at you while I was at the piano And you made an awful hit with me Terry Again he was too staggered to reply And before he could gather his wits the girl went on Now is they any real reason why you shouldn t get out of here tomorrow morning It was a blow of quite another sort But why should I go She grew very solemn with a trace of sadness in her voice I ll tell you why Terry Because if you stay around here too long they ll make you what you don t want to be another Black Jack Don t you see that that s why they like you Because you re his son and because they want you to be another like him Not that I have anything against him I guess he was a fine fellow in his way She paused and stared directly at him in a way he found hard to bear He must of been But that isn t the sort of a man you want to make out of yourself I know You re trying to go straight Well Terry nobody that ever stepped could stay straight long when they had around em Denver Pete and my father She said the last with a sob of grief He tried to protest but she waved him away I know And it s true He d do anything for me except change himself Believe me Terry you got to get out of here pronto Is they anything to hold you here A great deal Three hundred dollars I owe your father She considered him again with that mute shake of the head Then Do you mean it I see you do I don t suppose it does any good for me to tell you that he cheated you out of that money If I was fool enough to lose it that way I won t take it back I knew that too I guessed it Oh Terry I know a pile more about the inside of your head than you d ever guess Well I knew that and I come with the money so s you can pay back Dad in the morning Here it is and they s just a mite more to help you on your way She laid the little handful of gold on the table beside the bed and rose Don t go said Terry when he could speak Don t go Kate I m not that low I can t take your money She stood by the bed and stamped lightly Are you going to be a fool about this too Your father offered to give me back all the money I d won I can t do it Kate He could see her grow angry beautifully angry Is they no difference between Kate Pollard and Joe Pollard Something leaped into his throat He wanted to tell her in a thousand ways just how vast that difference was Man you d make a saint swear and I ain t a saint by some miles You take that money and pay Dad and get on your way This ain t no place for you Terry Hollis I he began She broke in Don t say it You ll have me mad in a minute Don t say it I have to I can t take money from you Then take a loan He shook his head Ain t I good enough to even loan you money she cried fiercely The shaft of moonlight had poured past her feet she stood in a pool of it Good enough said Terry Good enough Something that had been accumulating in him now swelled to bursting flooded from his heart to his throat He hardly knew his own voice it was so transformed with sudden emotion There s more good in you than in any man or woman I ve ever known Terry are you trying to make me feel foolish I mean it and it s true You re kinder more gentle Gentle Me Oh Terry But she sat down on the bed and she listened to him with her face raised as though music were falling on her a thing barely heard at a perilous distance They ve told you other things but they don t know I know Kate The moment I saw you I knew and it stopped my heart for a beat the knowing of it That you re beautiful and true as steel that you re worthy of honor and that I honor you with all my heart That I love your kindness your frankness your beautiful willingness to help people Kate I ve lived with a woman who taught me what was true You ve taught me what s glorious and worth living for Do you understand Kate And no answer but a change in her face that stopped him I shouldn t of come she whispered at length and I I shouldn t have let you talk the way you ve done But oh Terry when you come to forget what you ve said don t forget it all the way keep some of the things tucked away in you somewhere She rose from the bed and slipped across the white brilliance of the shaft of moonlight It made a red gold fire of her hair Then she flickered into the shadow Then she was swallowed by the darkness ranch n He went to work on a ranch The ranch is in the middle of a large plateau nemesis n
