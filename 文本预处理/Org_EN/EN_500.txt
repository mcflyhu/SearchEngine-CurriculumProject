During the next few days O Reilly had reason to bless the happy chance which had brought Norine Evans to Cuba During the return journey from San Antonio de los Banos he had discovered how really ill Esteban Varona was how weak his hold upon life The young man showed the marks of wasting illness and of cruel abuse starvation neglect and disease had all but done for him After listening to his ravings O Reilly began to fear that the poor fellow s mind was permanently affected It was an appalling possibility one to which he could not reconcile himself To think that somewhere in that fevered brain was perhaps locked the truth about Rosa s fate if not the secret of her whereabouts and yet to be unable to wring an intelligent answer to a single question was intolerable The hours of that ride were among the longest O Reilly had ever passed But Norine Evans gave him new heart She took complete charge of the sick man upon his arrival in camp then in her brisk matter of fact way she directed O Reilly to go and get some much needed rest Esteban was ill very ill she admitted there was no competent doctor near and her own facilities for nursing were primitive indeed nevertheless she expressed confidence that she could cure him and reminded O Reilly that nature has a blessed way of building up a resistance to environment As a result of her good cheer O Reilly managed to enjoy a night s sleep Leslie Branch was later than the others in arriving for the baby proved to be a trial and a handicap His comrades had refused him any assistance on the homeward journey They expressed a deep hoarse condemnation of his conduct and pretended to consider that he had sacrificed all claims to their friendship and regard Branch took this seriously and he was in a state bordering upon desperation when he reached camp In the hope of unloading his unwelcome burden upon Norine Evans he hurried directly to her tent But Norine had heard the story Lopez had warned her therefore she waved him away Don t ask me to mother your stolen child she said Oh but you ve GOT to he declared in a panic You ve just GOT to Well I won t In the first place I have a sick man in my tent But look Listen This baby dislikes me I ve nearly dropped it a dozen times I I m going to leave it anyhow But Norine remained firm in her refusal You sha n t leave your foundling at MY door If you intend to steal babies you should make up your mind to take care of them She was itching to seize the hungry little mite but she restrained the impulse Go ahead and keep it amused until the cow arrives she told him Keep it AMUSED Amuse a starving brat tragically cried the man In Heaven s name how Why play with it cuddle it give it your watch anything But don t allow it to cry it may injure itself Branch glared resentfully then he changed his tactics and began to plead Oh Norine he implored I just can t do it I m all fagged out now and besides I ve got the only watch in camp that keeps time I didn t sleep any last night and it ll keep me awake all to night It s a nice baby really It needs a woman Norine parted the flaps of her tent and pointed inside where Esteban Varona lay upon her cot His eyes were staring his lips were moving Mrs Ruiz and I will have our hands full with that poor chap For all we know he may have some contagious disease Branch was utterly shameless utterly selfish and uncompassionate I m sick too sicker than he is Have a heart Remember I risked my life to get you something nice to eat Yes The most ridiculous procedure I ever heard of What ever made you do such a crazy thing Norine was honestly indignant now I did it for you It seems to me that the least you can do in return The least and the most I can do is to try and save this poor man s life she firmly reasserted Now run along I d take the baby if I could but I simply can t It ll die on me Branch protested Nonsense It s the healthiest little thing I ever saw Wait until it has its supper You ll see She disappeared into her tent and Branch reluctantly turned away Next he bore the infant to Judson and O Reilly in turn but both gruffly refused to assume the least responsibility for it In the matter of advice concerning its welfare however they were more obliging They were willing to discuss the theory of child rearing with him as long as he would listen but their advice merely caused him to glare balefully and to curse them Nor did he regard it as a mark of friendship on their part when they collected an audience that evening to watch him milk the cow a procedure by the way not devoid of excitement and hazard inasmuch as Branch s knowledge of cows was even more theoretical than his knowledge of babies Leslie had begun by this time to realize that there existed a general conspiracy against him he met it with sullen resentment He deeply regretted his ignorance of the Spanish language however for a thousand epithets and insults clamored for translation Now there are cows which an amateur can milk and there are other kinds This particular cow was shy apprehensive peevish Branch s unpractised fumbling irritated her Being herself a nomad of the savannas she was accustomed to firm masterful men therefore when Leslie attempted courteously apologetically to separate her from her milk she turned and hooked him El Demonio s audience who had been looking on with rapt attention applauded this show of spirit Branch was unwontedly meek He acknowledged his total inexperience and begged his friends almost politely to call for a substitute Judson explained gravely These Cubans don t know any more about cows than you do O Reilly agreed They re good bull fighters but they can t milk Leslie eyed the speakers white with rage he was trembling You think you re damned funny don t you You re having a jubilee with me Well I m game I ll go through with it If you ll hold her I ll milk her I ll milk her till she hollers Obligingly O Reilly took the animal by the horns and Judson laid hold of her tail Stretch her tight Leslie commanded Don t give her an inch of slack or I ll quit When his friends had braced themselves he moved toward the cow once more but this time from the opposite quarter Noting the direction of his approach the onlookers gave vent to a low murmur of expectancy They drew closer Strangely enough the animal stood quiet for a time lost in amazement perhaps and Leslie managed to cover the bottom of his big tin cup with milk But at last the outrage proved too much for her she slowly lifted one hind foot and poised it jerkily She seemed to consider the next move for a moment then she kicked forward and sent Branch flying Can you beat that O Reilly exclaimed in apparent wonderment Why she walloped you with the back of her hand Judson too affected great amazement Most cows are left handed he declared Try her on the other side Branch dried the milk from his face then in a shaking voice cried Have a good time with me It s your last chance It seemed for a while that the enterprise was doomed to failure but at last a pint or more of milk was secured and this Leslie proceeded to dilute with warm water from a near by camp fire Even then however his difficulties were not over He had supposed that any baby knew enough to drink It took him half an hour to discover his mistake Having long since given up the hope of any active assistance from his audience he doggedly set to work to fashion a nursing bottle He succeeded in due time after making use of a flask the stem of an unused cigarette holder and a handkerchief When he finally took seat and began awkwardly coaxing the fretful child to drink the Cubans voiced their appreciation of the picture They were courteous they did not laugh nevertheless the sight of their eccentric irascible rebellious El Demonio tamely nursing a child in the fire light filled them with luxurious soul satisfying enjoyment O Reilly was up at daylight to offer his services in caring for Esteban Varona but Norine declined them His fever is down a little and he has taken some nourishment she reported That food you boys risked your silly lives for may come in handy after all I dare say he won t be able to talk to me to day O Reilly ventured Not to day nor for many days I m afraid If you don t mind then I ll hang around and listen to what he says he told her wistfully He might drop a word about Rosa To be sure So far he s scarcely mentioned her I can t understand much that he says of course but Mrs Ruiz tells me it s all jumbled and quite unintelligible How is Leslie s baby this morning Oh it passed a good night It was awake and had ordered breakfast when I got up Leslie was making a fire to scald out its bottle He says he didn t close his eyes all night Poor fellow I m going to help him Norine declared Please don t Lopez wants to teach him a lesson and this is the best thing that could possibly have happened We have told him that there s no chance of returning the baby and he thinks he s elected to keep it indefinitely As a matter of fact Jacket is going to take a letter to the comandante at San Antonio this morning advising him that the child is safe and asking him to send for it at once Isn t that risky Norine inquired Won t the comandante attack us if he learns where we are Lopez doesn t think so Those Spaniards are usually pretty scrupulous on points of honor There was some difficulty in getting a messenger but Jacket volunteered He volunteers for anything that boy They wouldn t be likely to hurt a kid like him If they should why we have the baby you see Although Norine had pretended to wash her hands of all responsibility for Branch s little charge she was by no means so inhuman as she appeared During the day she kept a jealous eye upon it and especially upon its diet Fortunately for all concerned it was a good natured child so long as its stomach was full it was contented It slept a good deal and what time it was awake it sucked its fist and suffered itself to be variously entertained by the men There were of course a number of fellows who could see no humor at all in El Demonio s plight nor any reason for adding to his embarrassments These came to his aid in numerous ways It was an idle day there was nothing to do except play with the baby before night came the child had established itself as a general favorite Even Branch himself had become interested in it Say I ve learned a lot about kids from this one he confided to O Reilly at dinner time I always thought young babies were just damp sour smelling little animals but this one has character She knows me already and I m getting so I can pick her up without feeling that I m going to puncture her She s full of dimples too Got em everywhere What do you think we d better name her She probably has a name Do you expect to keep her permanently Branch considered I wouldn t have thought of such a thing yesterday but how are we going to get rid of her That s the question We can t just leave her with the first family we come to These country people have more kids than they know what to do with Thinking about taking her on the march with us O Reilly looked up much amused I don t see why it couldn t be done The men wouldn t mind and she d make a dandy mascot O Reilly shook his head This isn t a baseball team What about the baby s mother Bullets Fine mother SHE was to desert her child I ll bet she s glad to get rid of it People like that don t have any more affection than cattle They don t deserve to have children What s more they don t know how to care for them I d like to raise this kid according to my own ideas Branch s face lightened suddenly Say I ve just thought of a name for her What Bullets Are you swearing or naming her Wouldn t that be a good name It s new and it means something Raid battle rain of bullets See Bullets Branch that doesn t sound bad With deliberate malice O Reilly said gravely Of course if you adopt her you can name her what you choose but she s a mighty brown baby I have my suspicions that she s a mulatto Branch was shocked indignant That child s as white as you are he sputtered Then noting the twinkle in O Reilly s eyes he turned away muttering angrily Strangely enough Leslie s fantastic suggestion found echo in more than one quarter and many of his camp mates began to argue that El Demonio s baby would certainly bring the troop good luck if it could keep her Adoption of some sort was gravely discussed that evening around more than one camp fire After breakfast on the following morning the baby was bathed This was an event and it had been advertised as such An interested and admiring group of swarthy cigarette smokers looked on while Branch officiated Norine s offer to perform the service less publicly having been refused Leslie was just drying off the chubby form when he was unexpectedly interrupted Jacket had made his round trip in safety but instead of bringing a squad of the enemy s soldiers with him he had brought the child s parents which was a much more sensible thing to do The storekeeper and his wife arrived unheralded they gave no warning of their coming and they exchanged no amenities with the ravagers of their home Hearing the shrill petulant voice of their beloved they made directly for it as eagles swoop from the sky at threat to their nest Branch looked up at the sound of some swift approach He beheld an entirely strange woman bearing down upon him Her face was white frantic terrible her arms were outstretched she gave utterance to a peculiar distressing cry Snatching the baby from his lap without so much as by your leave she clutched it to a billowing brown bosom Leslie rose protesting just in time to receive the full onslaught of the child s distracted father He went down in a swirl of arms and legs he felt himself kicked pounded trampled beaten scratched until his friends came to the rescue and dragged him to his feet He rose to behold a small fat disheveled Spaniard who had turned from assaulting him and now appeared to be engaged in biting mouthfuls from such portions of the baby s anatomy as were not hidden in its mother s embrace A clamor of voices breaking the Sabbath calm of the morning brought Norine Evans running from her tent One look and its cause was plain Fifty men were talking loudly fifty pairs of arms were waving In consequence of the torrent of words that beat upon their ears it was some time before the merchant and his wife could be made to fully understand the peculiar circumstances of the kidnapping and that no harm had been intended to their darling Slowly bit by bit they learned the truth but even then the mother could not look upon Leslie Branch without a menacing dilation of the eyes and a peculiar expression of restrained ferocity The father was more reasonable however once he was assured of his daughter s safety his thankfulness sought outlet He began by embracing every one within his reach He kissed Norine he kissed O Reilly he kissed Judson he made a rush at Leslie himself but the latter suspicious of his intent fled Unmindful of the fact that these were the men who had relieved him of a considerable stock of goods and profaned his holy of holies he recklessly distributed among them what money he had upon his person and then gave away the remaining contents of his pockets He swore his undying love for them all Smiting his breast excitedly he urged them as a personal favor and a mark of his overflowing gratitude to return to San Antonio de los Banos make themselves masters of all his worldly possessions and then burn his store While this was going on Jacket was proudly advertising his share of the enterprise not failing to give himself full credit By I made a big hit with that comandante he told his American friends Those people in San Antonio say I m the bravest boy they ever seen and they give me more n a thousand cigars When I rode away I saluted the comandante then I yelled Vive Cuba Libre and everybody laughed like hell I guess those people never seen nobody like me before That afternoon when it came time for the merchant and his little family to set out for home a crowd of regretful Insurrectos assembled to bid them farewell and to look for the last time upon the baby By now the mother s apprehensions had given way to pride and she could bring herself to smile at the compliments showered upon her offspring and to answer in kind those which were aimed at herself She even permitted El Demonio to kiss the child good by Her husband since his arrival in camp had heard much about the eccentric American and now after apologizing abjectly for his unwarranted attack he invited Branch to visit his store when this hideous war was over and Cuba was free Finally in spite of Leslie s frantic struggles he embraced him and planted a moist kiss upon either cheek Amid loud and repeated good wishes and a cheer for the baby the visitors rode away Lopez linked his arm within O Reilly s as they turned back into the palm grove With a smile he said Well I hope this has taught your friend to steal no more babies I m afraid he ll steal the very next one he sees He fell in love with that one and wanted to keep it Oh he wasn t alone in that It s queer how sentimental soldiers become I ve often noticed it When I was in the Rubi Hills some of my fellows adopted a goat We had to eat it finally but those men wouldn t touch a piece of the flesh and they were starving By the way how is Varona doing About the same Lopez frowned I shall have to send him to Cubitas to morrow for we must be under way If he has to be moved let me do it I d like to be with him when he comes out of his fever and learn what he knows about his sister O Reilly s appeal was earnest The colonel readily yielded Go by all means Report to General Gomez and he no doubt will let you stay until the boy can talk He may have news from Matanzas by that time O Reilly pressed his colonel s hand gratefully You re mighty good said he There s one thing more Will you look out for Branch while I m gone and hold him down Lopez laughed lightly Oh he ll soon get over his recklessness This life agrees with him Why he s a different man already When he gets well and has something to live for he will want to live You ll see The Spoilers The Barrier permanently adv The accident left him permanently scarred The ship
