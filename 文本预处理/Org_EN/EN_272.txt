Frona turned to St Vincent as the last of the crowd filed out He clutched her hands spasmodically like a drowning man Do believe me Frona Promise me Her face flushed You are excited she said or you would not say such things Not that I blame you she relented I hardly imagine the situation can be anything else but exciting Yes and well I know it he answered bitterly I am acting like a fool and I can t help it The strain has been terrible And as though the horror of Borg s end were not enough to be considered the murderer and haled up for mob justice Forgive me Frona I am beside myself Of course I know that you will believe me Then tell me Gregory In the first place the woman Bella lied She must have been crazed to make that dying statement when I fought as I did for her and Borg That is the only explanation Begin at the beginning she interrupted Remember I know nothing He settled himself more comfortably on the stool and rolled a cigarette as he took up the history of the previous night It must have been about one in the morning when I was awakened by the lighting of the slush lamp I thought it was Borg wondered what he was prowling about for and was on the verge of dropping off to sleep when though I do not know what prompted me I opened my eyes Two strange men were in the cabin Both wore masks and fur caps with the flaps pulled down so that I could see nothing of their faces save the glistening of the eyes through the eye slits I had no first thought unless it was that danger threatened I lay quietly for a second and deliberated Borg had borrowed my pistol and I was actually unarmed My rifle was by the door I decided to make a rush for it But no sooner had I struck the floor than one of the men turned on me at the same time firing his revolver That was the first shot and the one La Flitche did not hear It was in the struggle afterwards that the door was burst open which enabled him to hear the last three Well I was so close to the man and my leap out of the bunk was so unexpected that he missed me The next moment we grappled and rolled on the floor Of course Borg was aroused and the second man turned his attention to him and Bella It was this second man who did the killing for my man naturally had his hands full You heard the testimony From the way the cabin was wrecked you can picture the struggle We rolled and tossed about and fought till stools table shelves everything was smashed Oh Frona it was terrible Borg fighting for life Bella helping him though wounded and groaning and I unable to aid But finally in a very short while I began to conquer the man with whom I was struggling I had got him down on his back pinioned his arms with my knees and was slowly throttling him when the other man finished his work and turned on me also What could I do Two to one and winded So I was thrown into the corner and they made their escape I confess that I must have been badly rattled by that time for as soon as I caught my breath I took out after them and without a weapon Then I collided with La Flitche and John and and you know the rest Only he knit his brows in puzzlement only I cannot understand why Bella should accuse me He looked at her appealingly and though she pressed his hand sympathetically she remained silent weighing pro and con what she had heard She shook her head slowly It s a bad case and the thing is to convince them But my God Frona I am innocent I have not been a saint perhaps but my hands are clean from blood But remember Gregory she said gently I am not to judge you Unhappily it rests with the men of this miners meeting and the problem is how are they to be convinced of your innocence The two main points are against you Bella s dying words and the blood on your sleeve The place was areek with blood St Vincent cried passionately springing to his feet I tell you it was areek How could I avoid floundering in it fighting as I was for life Can you not take my word There there Gregory Sit down You are truly beside yourself If your case rested with me you know you would go free and clean But these men you know what mob rule is how are we to persuade them to let you go Don t you see You have no witnesses A dying woman s words are more sacred than a living man s Can you show cause for the woman to die with a lie on her lips Had she any reason to hate you Had you done her or her husband an injury He shook his head Certainly to us the thing is inexplicable but the miners need no explanation To them it is obvious It rests with us to disprove the obvious Can we do it The correspondent sank down despondently with a collapsing of the chest and a drooping forward of the shoulders Then am I indeed lost No it s not so bad as that You shall not be hanged Trust me for that But what can you do he asked despairingly They have usurped the law have made themselves the law In the first place the river has broken That means everything The Governor and the territorial judges may be expected in at any moment with a detachment of police at their backs And they re certain to stop here And furthermore we may be able to do something ourselves The river is open and if it comes to the worst escape would be another way out and escape is the last thing they would dream of No no impossible What are you and I against the many But there s my father and Baron Courbertin Four determined people acting together may perform miracles Gregory dear Trust me it shall come out well She kissed him and ran her hand through his hair but the worried look did not depart Jacob Welse crossed over the back channel long before dark and with him came Del the baron and Corliss While Frona retired to change her clothes in one of the smaller cabins which the masculine owners readily turned over to her her father saw to the welfare of the mail carrier The despatches were of serious import so serious that long after Jacob Welse had read and re read them his face was dark and clouded but he put the anxiety from him when he returned to Frona St Vincent who was confined in an adjoining cabin was permitted to see them It looks bad Jacob Welse said on parting for the night But rest assured St Vincent bad or not you ll not be stretched up so long as I ve a hand to play in the rumpus I am certain you did not kill Borg and there s my fist on it A long day Corliss remarked as he walked back with Frona to her cabin And a longer to morrow she answered wearily And I m so sleepy You re a brave little woman and I m proud of you It was ten o clock and he looked out through the dim twilight to the ghostly ice drifting steadily by And in this trouble he went on depend upon me in any way In any way she queried with a catch in her voice If I were a hero of the melodrama I d say To the death but as I m not I ll just repeat in any way You are good to me Vance I can never repay Tut tut I do not put myself on sale Love is service I believe She looked at him for a long time but while her face betrayed soft wonder at heart she was troubled she knew not why and the events of the day and of all the days since she had known him came fluttering through her mind Do you believe in a white friendship she asked at last For I do hope that such a bond may hold us always A bright white friendship a comradeship as it were And as she asked she was aware that the phrase did not quite express what she felt and would desire And when he shook his head she experienced a glad little inexplicable thrill A comradeship he questioned When you know I love you Yes she affirmed in a low voice I am afraid after all that your knowledge of man is very limited Believe me we are not made of such clay A comradeship A coming in out of the cold to sit by your fire Good But a coming in when another man sits with you by your fire No Comradeship would demand that I delight in your delights and yet do you think for a moment that I could see you with another man s child in your arms a child which might have been mine with that other man looking out at me through the child s eyes laughing at me through its mouth I say do you think I could delight in your delights No no love cannot shackle itself with white friendships She put her hand on his arm Do you think I am wrong he asked bewildered by the strange look in her face She was sobbing quietly You are tired and overwrought So there good night You must get to bed No don t go not yet And she arrested him No no I am foolish As you say I am tired But listen Vance There is much to be done We must plan to morrow s work Come inside Father and Baron Courbertin are together and if the worst comes we four must do big things Spectacular Jacob Welse commented when Frona had briefly outlined the course of action and assigned them their parts But its very unexpectedness ought to carry it through A coup d etat was the Baron s verdict Magnificent Ah I feel warm all over at the thought Hands up I cry thus and very fierce And if they do not hold up their hands he appealed to Jacob Welse Then shoot Never bluff when you re behind a gun Courbertin It s held by good authorities to be unhealthy And you are to take charge of La Bijou Vance Frona said Father thinks there will be little ice to morrow if it doesn t jam to night All you ve to do is to have the canoe by the bank just before the door Of course you won t know what is happening until St Vincent comes running Then in with him and away you go Dawson So I ll say good night and good by now for I may not have the opportunity in the morning And keep the left hand channel till you re past the bend Jacob Welse counselled him then take the cut offs to the right and follow the swiftest water Now off with you and into your blankets It s seventy miles to Dawson and you ll have to make it at
