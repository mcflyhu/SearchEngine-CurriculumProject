Esteban Varona made slow progress toward recovery In the weeks following O Reilly s departure from Cubitas his gain was steady but beyond a certain point he seemed unable to go Then he began to lose strength Norine was the first to realize the truth but it was some time before she would acknowledge it even to herself At last however she had to face the fact that Esteban s months of prison fare the abuse the neglect he had suffered in Spanish hands had left him little more than a living corpse It seemed as if fever had burned him out or else some dregs of disease still lingered in his system and had all but quenched that elusive spark which for want of a better name we call vitality Esteban too awoke to the fact that he was losing ground and his dismay was keen for a wonderful thing had come into his life and he spent much of his time in delicious contemplative day dreams concerning it waiting for the hour when he would dare translate those dreams into realities It seemed to him that he had always loved Norine certainly she had enshrined herself in his heart long before his mind had regained its clarity for he had come out of his delirious wanderings with his love full grown There had been no conscious beginning to it he had emerged from darkness into dazzling glory all in an instant Not until he found himself slipping backward did he attempt to set a guard upon himself for up to that hour he had never questioned his right to love He found his new task heavy almost too much for him to bear That he attempted it spoke well for the fellow s strength of character The time came finally when he could no longer permit the girl to deceive herself or him with her brave assumption of cheerfulness Norine had just told him that he was doing famously but he smiled and shook his weary head Let s be honest he said You know and I know that I can t get well Norine was engaged in straightening up the interior of the bark hut in which her patient was installed she ceased her labors to inquire with lifted brows Tut Tut Pray what do you mean by that There s something desperately wrong with me and I realized it long ago So did you but your good heart wouldn t let you Norine crossed quickly to the hammock and laid her cool hand upon the sick man s forehead You mustn t be discouraged she told him earnestly Remember this is a trying climate and we have nothing to do with Even the food is wretched Esteban s smile became wistful That isn t why my fever lasts If there were any life any health left in me you would rekindle it No there s something desperately wrong and we re wasting time You simply MUSTN T talk like this she cried Then at the look in his eyes she faltered for the briefest instant You ll undo all that we ve done Oh if I had you where I could take proper care of you If we were anywhere but here you d see I believe you But unfortunately we are not elsewhere I m going to take you away she exclaimed forcefully Esteban stroked her hand softly You can t do that Miss Evans You have been wonderful to me and I can t begin to express my gratitude Norine stirred but he retained his grasp of her fingers gaining courage from the contact to proceed I have been trying for a long time to tell you something Will you listen Norine possessed a dominant personality she had a knack of tactfully controlling and directing situations but of a sudden she experienced a panic stricken nutter and she lost her air of easy confidence Not now she exclaimed with a visible lessening of color Don t bother to tell me now I ve waited too long I must speak Norine was amazed at her own confusion which was nothing less than girlish she had actually gone to pieces at threat of something she had long expected to hear I know how tired of this work you have become the man was saying I know you re eager to get back to your own work and your own life Well You have stayed on here just to nurse me Isn t that true She nodded somewhat doubtfully Now then you must stop thinking about me and make your arrangements to go home Norine eyed the speaker queerly Is THAT what you have been trying so long to tell me she inquired Yes Is that all There was a moment of silence Yes You see I know how tired you are of this misery this poverty this hopeless struggle You re not a Cuban and our cause isn t yours Expeditions come from the United States every now and then and the Government will see that you are put safely aboard the first ship that returns I ll manage to get well somehow Norine s color had returned She stood over the hammock looking down mistily Don t you need me want me any more she inquired Esteban turned his tired eyes away fearing to betray in them his utter wretchedness You have done all there is to do I want you to go back into your own world and forget A sudden impulse seized the girl She stopped and gathered the sick man into her young strong arms Don t be silly she cried My world is your world Esteban dear I ll never never leave you Miss Evans NORINE Varona tried feebly to free himself You mustn t Norine was laughing through her tears If you won t speak I suppose I must but it is very embarrassing Don t you suppose I know exactly how much you love me Why you ve told me a thousand times Please PLEASE he cried in a shaking voice This is wrong I won t let you you a girl with everything Hush She drew him closer You re going to tell me that you have nothing can offer me nothing You re going to do the generous noble thing Well I hate generous people I m selfish utterly selfish and spoiled and I don t propose to be robbed of anything I want least of all my happiness You do love me don t you Esteban s cry was eloquent he clasped his arms about her and she held him fiercely to her breast Well then why don t you tell me so I I can t keep on proposing It isn t ladylike We re quite mad quite insane he told her after a while This only makes it harder to give you up You re not going to give me up and you re not going to die I sha n t let you Think what you have to live for I did wrong to surrender It was I who surrendered Come Must I say it all Aren t you going to ask me What Why to marry you of course Esteban gasped he looked deeply into Norine s eyes then he closed his own He shook his head Not that he whispered Oh not that We re going to be married and I m going to take you out of this miserable place What happiness he murmured If I were well But I won t let you marry a dying man Norine rose her face aglow with new strength new determination She dried her eyes and readjusted her hair with deft unconscious touch smiling down meanwhile at the man I brought you back when you were all but gone I saved you after the others had given you up and now you are mine to do with as I please You belong to me and I sha n t consult you She turned for a figure had darkened the door it was one of her English speaking convalescents who was acting as a sort of orderly Senorita the man said with a flash of white teeth we have another sick man and you d never guess who It is that American El Demonio Mr Branch Si The very same He has just come from the front Is he sick or wounded Esteban inquired Shot by a Spanish bullet He asked at once for our senorita Of course I ll come in an instant When the messenger had gone Norine bent and pressed her lips to Esteban s Remember you re mine to do with as I please she said then she fled down the grassy street Branch was waiting at Norine s quarters a soiled figure of dejection His left arm lay in a sling across his breast He looked up at her approach but she scarcely recognized him so greatly changed was he Leslie had filled out There was a healthy color beneath his deep tan his flesh was firm his eyes clear and bright Hello Norine he cried Well they got me Norine paused in astonishment Way LESLIE I was so frightened But you can t be badly hurt Bad enough so that Lopez sent me in A fellow gets flyblown if he stays in the field so I beat it Has your arm been dressed No I wouldn t let these rough and tumble doctors touch it They d amputate at the shoulder for a hang nail I don t trust em Then I ll look at it But Leslie shrugged Oh it s feeling fine right now I d rather leave it alone I just wanted to see you You mustn t neglect it there s danger of Gee You re looking great he interrupted It s better than a banquet just to look at you And YOU Norine scanned the invalid appraisingly Why you re another man Sure Listen to this He thumped his chest Best pair of bellows in Cuba The open air did it What a pity you were hurt just at such a time But you would take insane risks Now then let s have a look at your wound She pushed him protesting into her cabin It doesn t hurt really he declared It s only a scratch Of course you d say so Sit down Please don t bother If you don t mind But I do mind If you won t trust me I ll run for a doctor I tell you I can t stand em They ll probe around and give a fellow gangrene Then behave yourself Norine forced the patient into a chair and withdrew his arm from the sling Then despite his weak resistance she deftly removed the bandage From his expression she felt sure that she must be hurting him but when the injury was exposed she looked up in wonderment Leslie she exclaimed What in the world Well You insisted on seeing it he grumbled I told you it wasn t much He tried to meet her eyes but failed There was a moment s pause then Norine inquired curiously What is the trouble You d better fess up Branch struggled with himself he swallowed hard then said I m going to You can see now why I didn t go to a doctor I did it shot myself You won t give me away Why I don t understand Oh I m in trouble I simply had to get away and this was all I could think of I wanted to blow a real hole through myself and I tried three times But I missed myself Missed yourself How Why Branch wiped the sweat from his face I flinched shut my eyes and pulled the trigger Norine seated herself weakly she stared in bewilderment at the unhappy speaker Afraid You El Demonio Why you aren t afraid of anything Say You don t believe all that stuff do you I m afraid of my shadow and always have been I m not brave and never was They told me I was going to die and it scared me so that I tried to end things quickly I couldn t bear to die slowly to KNOW that I was dying by inches But Lord It scared me even worse to go into battle I was blind with fright all the time and I never got over it Why the sight of a gun gives me a chill and I jump every time one goes off God how I ve suffered I went crazy at our first engagement crazy with fear I didn t know where I was or what happened or anything Afterward when they hailed me as a hero I thought they were kidding that everybody must know how frightened I was After a time I saw that I d fooled them and that shamed me Then I had to keep it up or become ridiculous But it nearly killed me If you re speaking the truth I m not sure you re such a coward as you make out Norine said Oh yes I am Wait Before I knew it I had a reputation Then I had to live up to it The speaker groaned It wasn t so bad as long as I felt sure I was going to die anyhow but when I discovered I was getting well Branch raised a pair of tragic eyes his tone changed I ll tell you what cured me I SCARED myself well Those bugs in my lungs died from suffocation for I never breathed as long as there was a Spaniard in the same county with me One day I found that I couldn t cough if I tried I got strong I slept well And EAT Huh I gobbled my share of food and whined for more I stole what belonged to the others I began to enjoy myself to have fun Life opened up nice and rosy I fell in love with my new self and the joy of living Then I didn t want to die never had you understand except to cheat the bugs it gave me the horrors to think of the chances I d taken To be strong to be healthy and free from pain to tear my food like a wild animal and to enjoy hard work was all new and strange and wonderful I was drunk with it To think of being cut down crippled reduced to the useless miserable thing I had been was intolerable I was twice as scared then as I d ever been for I had more to lose You understand I forced myself to do the insane things expected of me when people were looking natural pride I suppose but when they weren t looking oh how I dogged it I crawled on my belly and hid in holes like a snake How funny Norine exclaimed You ve got a blamed queer idea of humor Branch flashed with a show of his former irritability And so you shot yourself Yep I tried to select a good spot where it wouldn t hurt or prove too inconvenient but there isn t a place to spare on a fellow s whole body He needs every inch of himself every minute I was going to shoot myself in the foot but my feet are full of bones and I saw myself on crutches the rest of my life Why didn t you resign from the service You didn t regularly enlist and you ve surely earned your discharge Branch nodded I thought of that but I ve gained a reputation that I don t deserve and strangely enough I m madly jealous of it I thought if I were really shot by a regular bullet I d be mourned as a hero and have a chance to walk out with colors flying I want to tell my children if I ever have any what a glorious man I was and how I helped to free Cuba Oh I d lie like a thief to my own children Now you see why I don t want a doctor There s only one thing I want and that s HOME Leslie heaved a deep sigh Gee I m homesick So am I Norine feelingly declared I think I understand how you feel and I can t blame you for wanting to live now that you ve learned what a splendid thing life is If O Reilly had been with me I think I could have managed somehow for he would have understood too I I ll never go back to the front alone they can shoot me if they want to Have you heard anything from him Not a word Cuba swallowed him up Oh Leslie it is a cruel country It is taking the best and the youngest I want to go away He smiled mirthlessly I m fed up on it too I want to be where I can shave when I need to and wear something besides canvas pajamas I m cured of war I want a policeman to stop the traffic and help me across the street I want to put my feet under a breakfast table rustle a morning paper and slap an egg in the face That s all the excitement I hunger for Norine filled a basin with clean water and taking a fresh bandage wrapped up the self inflicted hurt Branch watching her anxiously Now and again he flinched like a child when she touched his wound At last he inquired apprehensively Is it infected No Lord I m glad Wouldn t it be just my luck to get blood poisoning Norine surprised her patient by inquiring irrelevantly Leslie is there anybody here who can marry people Eh Why of course Then suddenly his somber face lightened and he cried NORINE DO YOU MEAN IT Not you I wouldn t marry you Why not I m perfectly well Please answer me Leslie settled back in his chair I dare say some of the Cuban Cabinet officers could put up a good bluff at a marriage ceremony A bluff wouldn t do Who s going to be married I am Branch started to his feet once more his mouth fell open You Nonsense When she nodded his face darkened Who is he Some Cuban I ll bet one of these greasers It is poor Esteban Poor Esteban Damn it they re all poor That s the very reason he asked you He s after your money He didn t ask me I asked him He s dying Leslie There was a pause I m going to marry him and take him home where he can get well What will O Reilly say I m afraid we ll never see O Reilly again Cuba frightens me It has taken him it will take Esteban and that would break my heart Do you love him as much as that Norine raised her eyes and in their depths Branch read her answer Well that ends the rest of us he sighed There s a Minister of Justice here I believe he sounds as if he could perform most any kind of a ceremony We ll find out for sure It so happened that the President and well nigh the entire Provisional Cabinet were in Cubitas Leslie and Norine went directly to the former The supreme official was eager to oblige in every way the guest of his Government and her dare devil countryman El Demonio He promptly sent for the Minister of Justice who in turn gallantly put himself at Norine s disposal He declared that although he had never performed the marriage ceremony he would gladly try his hand at it In no time the news had spread and there was subdued excitement throughout the camp When Norine left headquarters she was the target of smiles and friendly greetings Women nodded and chattered at her ragged soldiers swept her salutes with their jipi japa hats children clung to her and capered by her side It was vastly embarrassing this shameless publicity but it was touching too for there was genuine affection and good will behind every smile Norine was between tears and laughter when she ran panting into Esteban s cabin leaving Branch to wait outside At sight of her Esteban uttered a low cry of happiness Dearest I ve been lying in a stupor of delight The world has become bright I hear people laughing What a change And how is El Demonio He s all right he s waiting to see you but first I ve arranged everything The President and his Cabinet are coming to witness the ceremony Esteban poised petrified upon his elbow his face was a study What have you arranged he managed to inquire Sh h Norine laid a finger upon his lips The guest of the Republic is to be married to day Dignitaries magistrates nabobs are turning out in her honor They are shaving and borrowing clean shirts for the occasion The Minister of Justice has a brand new pair of tan shoes and he has promised to wear them come rain or shine NORINE Oh my dear quavered the sick man I can t let you do this mad thing Think I m ready for the grave This will make you well We re going away when the very next expedition arrives But still Varona protested No no Who am I I have nothing to offer nothing to give I m poorer than a peon Thank goodness I can do all the giving I ve never told you Esteban but I m quite rich Holding the man away she smiled into his eyes Yes richer than I have any right to be I had no need to come to Cuba it was just the whim of an irresponsible spoiled young woman I gave a huge amount of money to the New York Junta and that s why I was allowed to come You re not a a trained nurse Oh dear no Except when it amuses me to pretend How strange The invalid was dazed but after a moment he shook his head It is hard to say this but I don t know whether you really love me or whether your great heart has been touched You have learned my feelings and perhaps think in this way to make me well Is that it No no I m thoroughly selfish and must have what I want I want you So don t let s argue about it Norine tenderly enfolded the weak figure in her arms You must you SHALL get well or I shall die too I haven t the strength to refuse Esteban murmured And yet how can I leave Cuba What right have I to accept happiness and leave Rosa This was a subject which Norine dreaded a question to which she knew no answer She was not in a mood to discuss it and made no attempt to do so Instead she laid the invalid upon his pillow saying Leslie is waiting to wish you joy and a quick recovery May I ask him in She stepped to the door only to behold her late companion making off down the village street in great haste and evident excitement Surprised offended she checked her impulse to call him back A moment then she stepped out into the full sunlight and stared after him for she saw that which explained his desertion Approaching between the drunken rows of grass huts was a little knot of people Even as Norine watched it grew into a considerable crowd for men and women and children came hurrying from their tasks There were three figures in the lead a man and two boys and they walked slowly ploddingly as if weary from a long march Norine decided that they were not villagers but ragged pacificos upon the verge of exhaustion She saw Branch break into a swifter run and heard him shout something then through eyes suddenly dimmed she watched him fall upon the tallest of the three strangers and embrace him The crowd grew thicker It surrounded them Esteban Norine cried in a voice she scarcely recognized She retreated into the doorway with one hand upon her leaping heart Esteban Look Some one has just arrived Leslie has gone She cleared her vision with a shake of her head and her tongue grew thick with excitement They re coming HERE Yes It s it s O REILLY Young Varona struggled from his hammock ROSA he called loudly ROSA Norine ran and caught him or he would have fallen prone He pawed and fumbled in a weak attempt to free himself from her restraining arms a wildness was upon him he shook as if with palsy Did he bring her with him Is she here Why don t you answer me Rosa He began to mutter unintelligibly his vitality flared up and it was with difficulty that Norine could hold him down His gaze fixed upon the square of sunlight framed by the low doorway was blazing with excitement To Norine it seemed as if his spirit in the uncertainty of this moment was straining to leap forth in an effort to learn his sister s fate The crowd was near at hand now There came the scuffling of feet and murmur of many voices Esteban fell silent he closed his hot bony hands upon Norine s wrists in a painful grip He bent forward his soul centered in his tortured eyes There came a shadow then in the doorway the figure of a man a tattered scarecrow of a man whose feet were bare and whose brown calves were exposed through flapping rags His breast was naked where thorns had tried to stay him his beard even his hair were matted and unkempt and the mud of many trails lay caked upon his garments It was O Reilly He peered blinking into the obscurity then he turned and drew forward a frail hunchbacked boy whose face was almost a mulatto hue Hand in hand they stepped into the hut and once again Esteban Varona s soul found outlet in his sister s name He held out his shaking hungry arms and the misshapen lad ran into them Dumb with amazement blind with tears Norine found herself staring upward into O Reilly s face and heard him saying I told you I would bring her home The next instant she lay upon his breast
