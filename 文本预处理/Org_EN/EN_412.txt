The morning was alive in the hospital The sun glinted in Pale faces lifted on their pillows turned toward it and Achilles passing with light step between the rows smiled at them Alcibiades was better They had told him in the office that he might talk to him to day a little while and his face glowed with the joy of it The boy hailed him from far down the ward his weak voice filled with gladness and Achilles hurried He dropped into the chair beside him and took the thin hand in his strong dark one holding it while he talked gentle words full of the morning and of going home The boy s eyes brightened watching his father s face Pain gone he said all gone His hand lifted to his forehead Achilles bent forward and touched it lightly brushing the hair across it You are well now he said gratefully The boy smiled his dark eyes fixed absently on his thoughts They bad men he said abruptly Achilles leaned forward with anxious look but the boy s eyes were clear They run down he said quietly and go fast like wind I try I run They shout and hit cart and swear and I lie on ground His lifted eyes seemed to be looking up at some great object passing close above him and a look of dread held them He drew a quick breath They bad men he said Little girl cry Achilles bent forward holding his breath What was it Alcie The boy s eyes turned toward him trustingly They hurt bad he said I try I run And the little girl suggested Achilles gently His voice would not have turned the breath of a dream but Alcibiades wrinkled his forehead She cry he said She look at me and cry quick They hurt that little girl Yes she cry His eyes closed sleepily The nurse came forward Better not talk any more she said Achilles got to his feet He bent over the boy his heart beating fast Good bye Alcie To morrow you tell me more all about the little girl The words dropped quietly into the sleeping ear and the boy turned his face To morrow tell about little girl he murmured and was asleep Achilles passed swiftly out of the hospital through the sun glinting wards out to the free air his heart choking him At the corner he caught a car bound for the South side and boarded it And at the same moment Philip Harris in his office in the works was summoning the Chief of Police to instruct him to open negotiations with the kidnappers But Achilles reached the office first and before noon every member of the force knew that a clue had been found a clue light as a child s breath between sleep and waking but none the less a clue and to morrow more would be known So Philip Harris stayed his hand because of the muttered half incoherent word of a Greek boy drowsing in a great sunny ward the millionaire waited and little children were safer that night ward n vt The hospital has a medical ward and a surgical ward During the evening picnic I ll carry a torch to ward off the bugs bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them fixed adj Have you two fixed on a date for the wedding yet Once the aim is fixed we should not change it arbitrarily abruptly adv He gestured abruptly for Virginia to get in the car I was abruptly notified that a half hour speech was expected of me dread vt n We all dread to think what will happen if the company closes Her heart was relieved of its blankest dread wards ward This hospital has medical [surgical] wards [ ] It was a big constituency divided into three wards negotiations negotiation negotiations for a durable peace Negotiations have failed to establish any middle ground kidnappers n kidnapper They were freed yesterday by their kidnappers unharmed The kidnappers had threatened to behead all four unless their jailed comrades were released
