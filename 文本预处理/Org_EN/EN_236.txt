Inside an hour O Mally Babbitts and I were on our way to Philadelphia All friction was forgotten a bigger issue had extinguished the sparks that had come near bursting into flame A mutual desire united us the finding of Barker The train an express seemed to crawl like a tortoise but the way I felt I guess the flight of an a roplane would have been slow I had hideous fears that he might give us the slip but O Mally was confident One of his men had got a lead on Barker through a vendor of newspapers from whom the capitalist twice in the last week had purchased the big New York dailies It had taken several days to locate his place of hiding a quiet boarding house far removed from the center of the city which was now under surveillance As we swung through the night shut close in a smoke filled compartment we speculated as to whether he would try and throw a bluff or see the game was up and tell the truth At the station O Mally s man met us and the four of us piled into a taxi and started on a run across town It was moonlight and going down those quiet streets lined with big houses and then with little houses still dwindling vistas sleeping in the silver radiance seemed to me the longest drive I d ever taken in my life As we sped the detective gave us further particulars By his instructions the newsstand man who left the morning papers at the boarding house had got into communication with the servant a colored girl From her he had learnt that Barker he passed under the name of Joseph Sammis had been away for twenty four hours and had come back that morning so ill that a doctor had been called in The doctor had said the man s heart was weak and that his condition looked like the result of strain or shock Questioned further the girl had said he was A pleasant civil spoken old gentleman giving no trouble to anybody He went out very little sitting in his room most of the time reading the papers He received no mail there but that he did get letters she had found out as she had seen one on his table addressed to the General Delivery The house was on a street quiet and deserted at this early hour one of a row all built alike As we climbed out of the taxi the moon was bright the shadows lying like black velvet across the lonely roadway On the opposite side loitering slow was a man who raising a hand to his hat passed on into the darkness along the area railings Though it was only a little after nine many of the houses showed the blankness of unlit windows but in the place where we had stopped a fan light over the door glowed in a yellow semicircle As the taxi moved off we three O Mally s detective slipped away into the shadow like a ghost walked up a little path to the front door where I pulled an old fashioned bell handle I could hear the sound go jingling through the hall loud and cracked and then steps languid and dragging come from somewhere in the rear I was to act as spokesman my cue being to ask for Mr Sammis on a matter of urgent business The door was opened by the colored girl who looked at us stupidly and then said she d call Miss Graves the landlady as she didn t think anyone could see Mr Sammis Standing back from the door she let us into a hall with a hatrack on one side and a flight of stairs going up at the back The light was dim coming from a globe held aloft by a figure that crowned the newel post The paper on the walls some dark striped pattern seemed to absorb what little radiance there was and the whole place smelled musty and was as quiet as a church The colored girl had disappeared down a long passage and presently a door opened back there and a woman came out tall and thin in a skimpy black dress She approached us as we stood in a group by the hatrack leaning forward near sightedly and blinking at us through silver rimmed spectacles My maid says you want to see Mr Sammis she said in an unamiable voice Yes I answered We ve come from New York and it s imperative we see him this evening But you can t she snapped He s sick The doctor says he mustn t be disturbed Talking it over afterward we all confessed that we were seized by the same idea that this lanky old spinster might be in the game and Barker s illness was a fake Feeling as I did I was ready to leap forward grab her and lock her in her own parlor while the others chased up the stairs I could sense the slight uneasy stir of the two men beside me and I tried to inject a determination into my voice that while it was civil was also informing I m sorry but it s absolutely necessary that we transact our business with him now Can t you give me a message she demurred squinting her eyes up behind the glasses I ll see that it s delivered in the morning No Madam This is important and can t wait We won t be long we only have to consult with him for a few minutes She gave a shrug as much as to say Well this is your affair and drawing back pointed to the stairs He s up there fourth floor front second door to your left To each of us the suspicion that she was in with Barker had grown with every minute The idea once lodged in our minds possessed them and we went up those stairs slow at first and then as we got out of earshot faster and faster It was a run on the second flight and a gallop on the third On this landing there was no gas lit but a window at the end of the passage let in a square of moonlight that lay bright on the floor and showed us the hall s dim length and the outlines of closed doors It was the second of these on the left hand side and creeping toward it we stood for a moment getting our wind The place was very cold as if a window was open and there was not a sound Standing by the door O Mally knocked softly There was no answer In that half lit passage chilled with the icy breath of the winter night and held in a strange stillness I was seized by a grisly sense of impending horror If I d been a small boy my teeth would have begun to chatter At thirty years of age that doesn t happen but I doubt whether anyone whose body was supplied with an ordinarily active nervous system would not have felt something sinister in that cold dark place in the silence behind that close shut door O Mally knocked again and again there was no answer Try it I whispered and the detective turned the handle Locked he breathed back then Stand away there I m going to break it There s something wrong here He turned sideways bracing his shoulder against the door There was a cracking sound and the lock embedded in old soft wood gave way the door swinging in with O Mally hanging to the handle The room was unlit but for the silver moonlight that came from the window uncurtained and open At that sight the same thought seized the three of us the man was gone and O Mally fumbling in his pocket for matches broke into furious profanity I had a box and as I dug round for it took a look about and saw the shapes of a chair with garments hanging over it an open desk and against the opposite wall the bed It was only a pale oblong and looked irregular as if the clothes were heaped on it as the man had thrown them back I could have joined O Mally in his swearing Gone when our fingers were closing on him Then I found the matches and the gas burst out over our heads My eyes were on the bed and O Mally s must have been for simultaneously I gave an exclamation and he leaped forward There asleep under the covers lay a man Quick as a flash of lightning the detective was beside him bending to look close at the face then he drew back with a sound a cry of amazement disbelief and pulling off the bed clothes laid his hand on the sleeper s chest God in Heaven he gasped turning to us He s dead Babbitts and I made a rush for the bed I to the head where I leaned low to make sure staring into the gray pale face with its prominent nose and sunken eyes Then it was my turn to cry out to stagger back looking from one man to the other aghast at what I d seen It s not Barker at all For a moment we stared at one another jaws fallen eyes stony Not a word came from one of us the silence broken by the hissing rush of the gas turned up full cock in a sputtering ribbon of flame I came to myself first turned from them back to the dead face its marble calm in strange contrast to the stunned consternation of the living faces It s not he I repeated I ve often seen him It s not the man Well well stammered O Mally coming out of his stupor Who on earth is it How do I know Sammis I suppose It s like him the nose the eyes and the eyebrows and the mustache But I looked at them gazing like two stupefied animals at the head on the pillow it s not Johnston Barker O Mally with a groan of baffled desperation fell into a chair his hands hanging over the arms his feet limp on the floor before him Babbitts stood paralyzed leaning on the foot of the bed It was an extraordinary situation three live men hot on the chase of a fourth and in the moment of victory faced by the most inscrutable and solemn thing that life holds a dead man We couldn t get over it couldn t seem to think or act grouped round the bed with the whistling rush of the gas loud on the silence Then suddenly another and more distant sound broke up our stupefaction Someone was coming up the stairs It jerked us back to life and I made a run for the door O Mally s whisper hissing after me If it s that woman keep her away for a while I want to go over the room It was Miss Graves ascending slowly with the help of the balustrade I caught her on the landing and told her what we d found She was not greatly surprised the doctor had warned her I explained the broken door by telling her we had been alarmed by the silence and had forced our way in That too she took quietly and turned away gliding shadowlike down the stairs to send out the servant for the doctor When I re ntered the room its aspect was changed A sheet covered the dead man and O Mally and Babbitts with all the burners in the chandelier blazing had started looking over the room The detective was already at work on the papers in the desk Babbitts going through the clothes over the chair and the few others that hung in the cupboard Hustle and get busy said O Mally as he heard me come in If this isn t Johnston Barker it s the man we ve been trailing and I m pretty sure it s the one that attacked Ford There was a table by the bedside with a reading lamp and some books on it Moving these I came upon two newspaper clippings relating to the suicide of Harland In both Anthony Ford was mentioned The reporters had evidently spoken to him that night on the street gleaning any fragments of information they could One alluded to the fact that he was employed in the offices below Harland s the Azalea Woods Estates These words were heavily underlined in pencil Looks like it from this I said showing the clipping to O Mally He glanced at it and grunted going back to his inspection of a sheaf of papers he had found in one of the desk pigeonholes Meantime Babbitts had found in the coat that hung over the chair a wallet containing a hundred dollars a tailor s bill for a suit and coat receipted and bearing a New York address and Tony Ford s house and street number written in pencil on a neatly folded sheet of note paper Besides these there was one letter dated January typed and bearing no signature Its contents was as follows Enclosed please find one hundred dollars in two bills of fifty Will send same amount on same date next month if work should be still delayed Will communicate further later The envelope also addressed in typewriting was directed to Joseph Sammis General Delivery Philadelphia and bore a New York postmark We were working too quickly for much comment but Babbitts held out the paper with Ford s address on it toward O Mally This bears it out too he said O Mally looked at it and snapped the elastic back on the documents he d been going over From what I ve seen here he said Sammis was the man Ford was with in the real estate business These are all contracts bills and some correspondence the records of a small venture that went to smash he pushed the roll back in its pigeonhole not another thing There s not another thing in the room I answered except two novels and a stack of New York papers on the floor there by the bureau Hist quiet There were feet coming up the stairs In a twinkling everything was as it had been Babbitts and O Mally withdrew to the window and I went out to see who was coming It was Miss Graves and the doctor I explained the situation and found the doctor brusquely business like and matter of fact It was what might have been expected When he had been called in that morning he had found Mr Sammis a very sick man suffering from angina pectoris and a general condition of debility and exhaustion He had asked him if he had been subjected to any recent exertion or strain but been told no other than a trip the day before to Washington Miss Graves said it was undoubtedly this trip that had done the damage He had been well when he started on Tuesday morning but on returning twenty four hours later had been so weak and enfeebled that one of the other lodgers had had to assist him to his room An examination proved that he had been dead some hours Who his relations were or where he came from Miss Graves had no idea and would turn the matter over to the authorities It was close on midnight when we left and there being no vehicle in sight we walked up the street The moon was as bright as day and swinging along between those two lines of black houses with here and there a light shining yellow in an upper window we were silent each occupied by his own thoughts I could guess those of the other two Babbitts chagrin at once again losing his big story O Mally s sullen indignation at having followed a clue that led to such a blind alley But their disappointment and bitterness were nothing to mine All my hopes gone again and this last puzzle
