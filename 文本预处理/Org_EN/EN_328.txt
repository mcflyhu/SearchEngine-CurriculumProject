Daylight showed us how solitary the inn stood It was plainly hard upon the sea yet out of all view of it and beset on every side with scabbit hills of sand There was indeed only one thing in the nature of a prospect where there stood out over a brae the two sails of a windmill like an ass s ears but with the ass quite hidden It was strange after the wind rose for at first it was dead calm to see the turning and following of each other of these great sails behind the hillock Scarce any road came by there but a number of footways travelled among the bents in all directions up to Mr Bazin s door The truth is he was a man of many trades not any one of them honest and the position of his inn was the best of his livelihood Smugglers frequented it political agents and forfeited persons bound across the water came there to await their passages and I daresay there was worse behind for a whole family might have been butchered in that house and nobody the wiser I slept little and ill Long ere it was day I had slipped from beside my bedfellow and was warming myself at the fire or walking to and fro before the door [pg ]Dawn broke mighty sullen but a little after sprang up a wind out of the west which burst the clouds let through the sun and set the mill to the turning There was something of spring in the sunshine or else it was in my heart and the appearing of the great sails one after another from behind the hill diverted me extremely At times I could hear a creak of the machinery and by half past eight of the day Catriona began to sing in the house At this I would have cast my hat in the air and I thought this dreary desert place was like a paradise For all which as the day drew on and nobody came near I began to be aware of an uneasiness that I could scarce explain It seemed there was trouble afoot the sails of the windmill as they came up and went down over the hill were like persons spying and outside of all fancy it was surely a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be brought to dwell in At breakfast which we took late it was manifest that James More was in some danger or perplexity manifest that Alan was alive to the same and watched him close and this appearance of duplicity upon the one side and vigilance upon the other held me on live coals The meal was no sooner over than James seemed to come to a resolve and began to make apologies He had an appointment of a private nature in the town it was with the French nobleman he told me and we would please excuse him till about noon Meanwhile he carried [pg ]his daughter aside to the far end of the room where he seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen without much inclination I am caring less and less about this man James said Alan There s something no right with the man James and I wouldnae wonder but what Alan Breck would give an eye to him this day I would like fine to see yon French nobleman Davie and I daresay you could find an employ to yoursel and that would be to speer at the lassie for some news of your affair Just tell it to her plainly tell her ye re a muckle ass at the off set and then if I were you and ye could do it naitural I would just mint to her I was in some kind of a danger a weemenfolk likes that I cannae lee Alan I cannae do it naitural says I mocking him The more fool you says he Then ye ll can tell her that I recommended it that ll set her to the laughing and I wouldnae wonder but what that was the next best But see to the pair of them If I didnae feel just sure of the lassie and that she was awful pleased and chief with Alan I would think there was some kind of hocus pocus about yon And is she so pleased with ye then Alan I asked She thinks a heap of me says he And I m no like you I m one that can tell That she does she thinks a heap of Alan And troth I m thinking a [pg ]good deal of him mysel and with your permission Shaws I ll be getting a wee yont amang the bents so that I can see what way James goes One after another went till I was left alone beside the breakfast table James to Dunkirk Alan dogging him Catriona up the stairs to her own chamber I could very well understand how she should avoid to be alone with me yet was none the better pleased with it for that and bent my mind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned Upon the whole the best appeared to me to do like Alan If I was out of view among the sand hills the fine morning would decoy her out and once I had her in the open I could please myself No sooner said than done nor was I long under the bield of a hillock before she appeared at the inn door looked here and there and seeing nobody set out by a path that led directly seaward and by which I followed her I was in no haste to make my presence known the further she went I made sure of the longer hearing to my suit and the ground being all sandy it was easy to follow her unheard The path rose and came at last to the head of a knowe Thence I had a picture for the first time of what a desolate wilderness that inn stood hidden in where was no man to be seen nor any house of man except just Bazin s and the windmill Only a little further on the sea appeared and two or three ships upon it pretty as a drawing One of [pg ]these was extremely close in to be so great a vessel and I was aware of a shock of new suspicion when I recognized the trim of the Seahorse What should an English ship be doing so near in France Why was Alan brought into her neighbourhood and that in a place so far from any hope of rescue and was it by accident or by design that the daughter of James More should walk that day to the seaside Presently I came forth behind her in the front of the sand hills and above the beach It was here long and solitary with a man o war s boat drawn up about the middle of the prospect and an officer in charge and pacing the sands like one who waited I sat immediately down where the rough grass a good deal covered me and looked for what should follow Catriona went straight to the boat the officer met her with civilities they had ten words together I saw a letter changing hands and there was Catriona returning At the same time as if this was all her business on the Continent the boat shoved off and was headed for the Seahorse But I observed the officer to remain behind and disappear among the bents I liked the business little and the more I considered of it liked it less Was it Alan the officer was seeking or Catriona She drew near with her head down looking constantly on the sand and made so tender a picture that I could not bear to doubt her innocency The next she raised her face and recognised me [pg ]seemed to hesitate and then came on again but more slowly and I thought with a changed colour And at that thought all else that was upon my bosom fears suspicions the care of my friend s life was clean swallowed up and I rose to my feet and stood waiting her in a drunkenness of hope I gave her good morning as she came up which she returned with a good deal of composure Will you forgive my having followed you said I I know you are always meaning kindly she replied and then with a little outburst But why will you be sending money to that man It must not be I never sent it for him said I but for you as you know well And you have no right to be sending it to either one of us said she David it is not right It is not it is all wrong said I and I pray God he will help this dull fellow if it be at all possible to make it better Catriona this is no kind of life for you to lead and I ask your pardon for the word but yon man is no fit father to take care of you Do not be speaking of him even was her cry And I need speak of him no more it is not of him that I am thinking O be sure of that says I I think of the one thing I have been alone now this long time in Leyden and when I was by way of at my studies still I was thinking of that Next Alan came and I went among soldier men to their big dinners [pg ]and still I had the same thought And it was the same before when I had her there beside me Catriona do you see this napkin at my throat You cut a corner from it once and then cast it from you They re your colours now I wear them in my heart My dear I cannot want you O try to put up with me I stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on Try to put up with me I was saying try and bear me with a little Still she had never the word and a fear began to rise in me like a fear of death Catriona I cried gazing on her hard is it a mistake again Am I quite lost She raised her face to me breathless Do you want me Davie truly said she and I scarce could hear her say it I do that said I O sure you know it I do that I have nothing left to give or to keep back said she I was all yours from the first day if you would have had a gift of me she said This was on the summit of a brae the place was windy and conspicuous we were to be seen there even from the English ship but I kneeled down before her in the sand and embraced her knees and burst into that storm of weeping that I thought it must have broken me All thought was wholly beaten from my [pg ]mind by the vehemency of my discomposure I knew not where I was I had forgot why I was happy only I knew she stooped and I felt her cherish me to her face and bosom and heard her words out of a whirl Davie she was saying O Davie is this what you think of me Is it so that you were caring for poor me O Davie Davie With that she wept also and our tears were commingled in a perfect gladness It might have been ten in the day before I came to a clear sense of what a mercy had befallen me and sitting over against her with her hands in mine gazed in her face and laughed out loud for pleasure like a child and called her foolish and kind names I have never seen the place look so pretty as these bents by Dunkirk and the windmill sails as they bobbed over the knowe were like a tune of music I know not how much longer we might have continued to forget all else besides ourselves had I not chanced upon a reference to her father which brought us to reality My little friend I was calling her again and again rejoicing to summon up the past by the sound of it and to gaze across on her and to be a little distant My little friend now you are mine altogether mine for good my little friend and that man s no longer at all There came a sudden whiteness in her face she plucked her hands from mine [pg ] Davie take me away from him she cried There s something wrong he s not true There will be something wrong I have a dreadful terror here at my heart What will he be wanting at all events with that King s ship What will this word be saying And she held the letter forth My mind misgives me it will be some ill to Alan Open it Davie open it and see I took it and looked at it and shook my head No said I it goes against me I cannot open a man s letter Not to save your friend she cried I cannae tell said I I think not If I was only sure And you have but to break the seal said she I know it said I but the thing goes against me Give it here said she and I will open it myself Nor you neither said I You least of all It concerns your father and his honour dear which we are both misdoubting No question but the place is dangerous like and the English ship being here and your father having word of it and yon officer that stayed ashore He would not be alone either there must be more along with him I daresay we are spied upon this minute Ay no doubt the letter should be opened but somehow not by you nor me I was about this far with it and my spirit very much overcome with a sense of danger and hidden enemies [pg ]when I spied Alan come back again from following James and walking by himself among the sand hills He was in his soldier s coat of course and mighty fine but I could not avoid to shudder when I thought how little that jacket would avail him if he were once caught and flung in a skiff and carried on board of the Seahorse a deserter a rebel and now a condemned murderer There said I there is the man that has the best right to open it or not as he thinks fit With which I called upon his name and we both stood up to be a mark for him If it is so if it be more disgrace will you can bear it she asked looking upon me with a burning eye I was asked something of the same question when I had seen you but the once said I What do you think I answered That if I liked you as I thought I did and O but I like you better I would marry you at his gallows foot The blood rose in her face she came close up and pressed upon me holding my hand and it was so that we awaited Alan He came with one of his queer smiles What was I telling ye David says he There is a time for all things Alan said I and this time is serious How have you sped You can speak out plain before this friend of ours [pg ] I have been upon a fool s errand said he I doubt we have done better than you then said I and at least here is a great deal of matter that you must judge of Do you see that I went on pointing to the ship That is the Seahorse Captain Palliser I should ken her too says Alan I had fyke enough with her when she was stationed in the Forth But what ails the man to come so close I will tell you why he came there first said I It was to bring this letter to James More Why he stops here now that it s delivered what it s likely to be about why there s an officer hiding in the bents and whether or not it s probable that he s alone I would rather you considered for yourself A letter to James More said he The same said I Well and I can tell ye more than that said Alan For last night when you were fast asleep I heard the man colloquing with some one in the French and then the door of that inn to be opened and shut Alan cried I you slept all night and I am here to prove it Ay but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking says he But the business looks bad Let s see the letter I gave it him Catriona said he ye ll have to excuse me my [pg ]dear but there s nothing less than my fine bones upon the cast of it and I ll have to break this seal It is my wish said Catriona He opened it glanced it through and flung his hand in the air The stinking brock says he and crammed the paper in his pocket Here let s get our things thegether This place is fair death to me And he began to walk towards the inn It was Catriona who spoke the first He has sold you she asked Sold me my dear said Alan But thanks to you and Davie I ll can jink him yet Just let me win upon my horse he added Catriona must come with us said I She can have no more traffic with that man She and I are to be married At which she pressed my hand to her side Are ye there with it says Alan looking back The best day s work that ever either of ye did yet I And I m bound to say my dawtie ye make a real bonny couple The way that he was following brought us close in by the windmill where I was aware of a man in seaman s trousers who seemed to be spying from behind it Only of course we took him in the rear See Alan said I Wheesht said he this is my affairs [pg ]The man was no doubt a little deafened by the clattering of the mill and we got up close before he noticed Then he turned and we saw he was a big fellow with a mahogany face I think sir says Alan that you speak the English Non monsieur says he with an incredible bad accent Non monsieur cries Alan mocking him Is that how they learn you French on the Seahorse Ye muckle gutsey hash here s a Scots boot to your English hurdies And bounding on him before he could escape he dealt the man a kick that laid him on his nose Then he stood with a savage smile and watched him scramble to his feet and scamper off into the sand hills But it s high time I was clear of these empty bents said Alan and continued his way at top speed and we still following to the back door of Bazin s inn It chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to face with James More entering by the other Here said I to Catriona quick upstairs with you and make your packets this is no fit scene for you In the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst of the long room She passed them close by to [pg ]reach the stairs and after she was some way up I saw her turn and glance at them again though without pausing Indeed they were worth looking at Alan wore as they met one of his best appearances of courtesy and friendliness yet with something eminently warlike so that James smelled danger off the man as folk smell fire in a house and stood prepared for accidents Time pressed Alan s situation in that solitary place and his enemies about him might have daunted C sar It made no change in him and it was in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that he began the interview A braw good day to ye again Mr Drummond said he What ll yon business of yours be just about Why the thing being private and rather of a long story says James I think it will keep very well till we have eaten I m none so sure of that said Alan It sticks in my mind it s either now or never for the fact is me and Mr Balfour here have gotten a line and we re thinking of the road I saw a little surprise in James s eye but he held himself stoutly I have but the one word to say to cure you of that said he and that is the name of my business Say it then says Alan Hout wha minds for Davie [pg ] It is a matter that would make us both rich men said James Do ye tell me that cries Alan I do sir said James The plain fact is that it is Cluny s Treasure No cried Alan Have ye got word of it I ken the place Mr Stewart and can take you there said James This crowns all says Alan Well and I m glad I came to Dunkirk And so this was your business was it Halvers I m thinking That is the business sir says James Well well says Alan and then in the same tone of childlike interest It has naething to do with the Seahorse then he asked With what says James Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon windmill pursued Alan Hut man have done with your lees I have Palliser s letter here in my pouch You re by with it James More You can never show your face again with dacent folk James was taken all aback with it He stood a second motionless and white then swelled with the living anger Do you talk to me you bastard he roared out Ye glee d swine cried Alan and hit him a sounding buffet on the mouth and the next wink of time their blades clashed together [pg ]At the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped back from the collision The next I saw James parried a thrust so nearly that I thought him killed and it lowed up in my mind that this was the girl s father and in a manner almost my own and I drew and ran in to sever them Keep back Davie Are ye daft Damn ye keep back roared Alan Your blood be on your ain heid then I beat their blades down twice I was knocked reeling against the wall I was back again betwixt them They took no heed of me thrusting at each other like two furies I can never think how I avoided being stabbed myself or stabbing one of these two Rodomonts and the whole business turned about me like a piece of a dream in the midst of which I heard a great cry from the stair and Catriona sprang before her father In the same moment the point of my sword encountered something yielding It came back to me reddened I saw the blood flow on the girl s kerchief and stood sick Will you be killing him before my eyes and me his daughter after all she cried My dear I have done with him said Alan and went and sat on a table with his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand Awhile she stood before the man panting with big eyes then swung suddenly about and faced him [pg ] Begone was her word take your shame out of my sight leave me with clean folk I am a daughter of Alpin Shame of the sons of Alpin begone It was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror of my own bloodied sword The two stood facing she with the red stain on her kerchief he white as a rag I knew him well enough I knew it must have pierced him in the quick place of his soul but he betook himself to a bravado air Why says he sheathing his sword though still with a bright eye on Alan if this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau There goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me says Alan Sir cries James James More says Alan this lady daughter of yours is to marry my friend Davie upon the which account I let you pack with a hale carcase But take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of harm s way or ower late Little as you suppose it there are leemits to my temper Be damned sir but my money s there said James I m vexed about that too says Alan with his funny face but now ye see it s mines And then with more gravity Be you advised James More you leave this house James seemed to cast about for a moment in his [pg ]mind but it s to be thought he had enough of Alan s swordsmanship for he suddenly put off his hat to us and with a face like one of the damned bade us farewell in a series With which he was gone At the same time a spell was lifted from me Catriona I cried it was me it was my sword O are ye much hurt I know it Davie I am loving you for the pain of it it was done defending that bad man my father See she said and showed me a bleeding scratch see you have made a man of me now I will carry a wound like an old soldier Joy that she should be so little hurt and the love of her brave nature transported me I embraced her I kissed the wound And am I to be out of the kissing me that never lost a chance says Alan and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either shoulder My dear he said you re a true daughter of Alpin By all accounts he was a very fine man and he may weel be proud of you If ever I was to get married it s the marrow of you I would be seeking for a mother to my sons And I bear a king s name and speak the truth He said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to the girl and through her to me It seemed to wipe us clean of all James More s disgraces And the next moment he was just himself again And now by your leave my dawties said he [pg ] this is a very bonny but Alan Breck ll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than he s caring for and Dod I think this is a grand place to be leaving The word recalled us to some wisdom Alan ran upstairs and returned with our saddle bags and James More s portmanteau I picked up Catriona s bundle where she had dropped it on the stair and we were setting forth out of that dangerous house when Bazin stopped the way with cries and gesticulations He had whipped under a table when the swords were drawn but now he was as bold as a lion There was his bill to be settled there was a chair broken Alan had sat among his dinner things James More had fled Here I cried pay yourself and flung him down some Lewie d ors for I thought it was no time to be accounting He sprang upon that money and we passed him by and ran forth into the open Upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting and closing in a little nearer to us James More waved his hat as if to hurry them and right behind him like some foolish person holding up its hands were the sails of the windmill turning Alan gave but the one glance and laid himself down to run He carried a great weight in James More s portmanteau but I think he would as soon have lost his life as cast away that booty which was his revenge and he ran so that I was distressed to follow him and [pg ]marvelled and exulted to see the girl bounding at my side As soon as we appeared they cast off all disguise upon the other side and the seamen pursued us with shouts and view hullohs We had a start of some two hundred yards and they were but bandy legged tarpaulins after all that could not hope to better us at such an exercise I suppose they were armed but did not care to use their pistols on French ground And as soon as I perceived that we not only held our advantage but drew a little away I began to feel quite easy of the issue For all which it was a hot brisk bit of work so long as it lasted Dunkirk was still far off and when we popped over a knowe and found a company of the garrison marching on the
