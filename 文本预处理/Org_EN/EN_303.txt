The next day Sabbath August th I had the occasion I had long looked forward to to hear some of the famous Edinburgh preachers all well known to me already by the report of Mr Campbell Alas and I might just as well have been at Essendean and sitting under Mr Campbell s worthy self the turmoil of my thoughts which dwelt continually on the interview with Prestongrange inhibiting me from all attention I was indeed much less impressed by the reasoning of the divines than by the spectacle of the thronged congregation in the churches like what I imagined of a theatre or in my then disposition of an assize of trial above all at the West Kirk with its three tiers of galleries where I went in the vain hope that I might see Miss Drummond On the Monday I betook me for the first time to a barber s and was very well pleased with the result Thence to the Advocate s where the red coats of the soldiers showed again about his door making a bright place in the close I looked about for the young lady [pg ]and her gillies there was never a sign of them But I was no sooner shown into the cabinet or antechamber where I had spent so wearyful a time upon the Saturday than I was aware of the tall figure of James More in a corner He seemed a prey to a painful uneasiness reaching forth his feet and hands and his eyes speeding here and there without rest about the walls of the small chamber which recalled to me with a sense of pity the man s wretched situation I suppose it was partly this and partly my strong continuing interest in his daughter that moved me to accost him Give you a good morning sir said I And a good morning to you sir said he You bide tryst with Prestongrange I asked I do sir and I pray your business with that gentleman be more agreeable than mine was his reply I hope at least that yours will be brief for I suppose you pass before me said I All pass before me he said with a shrug and a gesture upward of the open hands It was not always so sir but times change It was not so when the sword was in the scale young gentleman and the virtues of the soldier might sustain themselves There came a kind of Highland snuffle out of the man that raised my dander strangely Well Mr Macgregor said I I understand the main thing for a soldier is to be silent and the first of his virtues never to complain [pg ] You have my name I perceive he bowed to me with his arms crossed though it s one I must not use myself Well there is a publicity I have shown my face and told my name too often in the beards of my enemies I must not wonder if both should be known to many that I know not That you know not in the least sir said I nor yet anybody else but the name I am called if you care to hear it is Balfour It is a good name he replied civilly there are many decent folk that use it And now that I call to mind there was a young gentleman your namesake that marched surgeon in the year with my battalion I believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith said I for I was ready for the surgeon now The same sir said James More And since I have been fellow soldier with your kinsman you must suffer me to grasp your hand He shook hands with me long and tenderly beaming on me the while as though he had found a brother Ah says he these are changed days since your cousin and I heard the balls whistle in our lugs I think he was a very far away cousin said I drily and I ought to tell you that I never clapped eyes upon the man Well well said he it makes no change And you I do not think you were out yourself sir I have [pg ]no clear mind of your face which is one not probable to be forgotten In the year you refer to Mr Macgregor I was getting skelped in the parish school said I So young cries he Ah then you will never be able to think what this meeting is to me In the hour of my adversity and in the house of my enemy to meet in with the blood of an old brother in arms it heartens me Mr Balfour like the skirling of the Highland pipes Sir this is a sad look back that many of us have to make some with falling tears I have lived in my own country like a king my sword my mountains and the faith of my friends and kinsmen sufficed for me Now I lie in a stinking dungeon and do you know Mr Balfour he went on taking my arm and beginning to lead me about do you know sir that I lack mere necessaries The malice of my foes has quite sequestered my resources I lie as you know sir on a trumped up charge of which I am as innocent as yourself They dare not bring me to my trial and in the meanwhile I am held naked in my prison I could have wished it was your cousin I had met or his brother Baith himself Either would I know have been rejoiced to help me while a comparative stranger like yourself I would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to me in this beggarly vein or the very short and grudging answers that I made to him There were times [pg ]when I was tempted to stop his mouth with some small change but whether it was from shame or pride whether it was for my own sake or Catriona s whether it was because I thought him no fit father for his daughter or because I resented that grossness of immediate falsity that clung about the man himself the thing was clean beyond me And I was still being wheedled and preached to and still being marched to and fro three steps and a turn in that small chamber and had already by some very short replies highly incensed although not finally discouraged my beggar when Prestongrange appeared in the doorway and bade me eagerly into his big chamber I have a moment s engagement said he and that you may not sit empty handed I am going to present you to my three braw daughters of whom perhaps you may have heard for I think they are more famous than papa This way He led me into another long room above where a dry old lady sat at a frame of embroidery and the three handsomest young women I suppose in Scotland stood together by a window This is my new friend Mr Balfour said he presenting me by the arm David here is my sister Miss Grant who is so good as keep my house for me and will be very pleased if she can help you And here says he turning to the three younger ladies here are my three braw dauchters A fair question [pg ]to ye Mr Davie which of the three is the best favoured And I wager he will never have the impudence to propound honest Alan Ramsay s answer Hereupon all three and the old Miss Grant as well cried out against this sally which as I was acquainted with the verses he referred to brought shame into my own cheek It seemed to me a citation unpardonable in a father and I was amazed that these ladies could laugh even while they reproved or made believe to Under cover of this mirth Prestongrange got forth of the chamber and I was left like a fish upon dry land in that very unsuitable society I could never deny in looking back upon what followed that I was eminently stockish and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have so long a patience with me The aunt indeed sat close at her embroidery only looking now and again and smiling but the misses and especially the eldest who was besides the most handsome paid me a score of attentions which I was very ill able to repay It was all in vain to tell myself I was a young fellow of some worth as well as good estate and had no call to feel abashed before these lasses the eldest not so much older than myself and no one of them by any probability half as learned Reasoning would not change the fact and there were times when the colour came into my face to think I was shaved that day for the first time [pg ]The talk going with all their endeavours very heavily the eldest took pity on my awkwardness sat down to her instrument of which she was a passed mistress and entertained me for a while with playing and singing both in the Scots and in the Italian manners this put me more at my ease and being reminded of Alan s air that he had taught me in the hole near Carriden I made so bold as to whistle a bar or two and ask if she knew that She shook her head I never heard a note of it said she Whistle it all through And now once again she added after I had done so Then she picked it out upon the keyboard and to my surprise instantly enriched the same with well sounding chords and sang as she played with a very droll expression and broad accent Haenae I got just the lilt of it Isnae this the tune that ye whustled You see she says I can do the poetry too only it won t rhyme And then again I am Miss Grant sib to the Advocate You I believe are Dauvit Balfour I told her how much astonished I was by her genius And what do you call the name of it she asked I do not know the real name said I I just call it Alan s air She looked at me directly in the face I shall call [pg ]it David s air said she though if it s the least like what your namesake of Israel played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by it for it s but melancholy music Your other name I do not like so if you was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by mine This was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog Why that Miss Grant I asked Why says she if ever you should come to get hanged I will set your last dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it This put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story and peril How or just how much it was more difficult to guess It was plain she knew there was something of danger in the name of Alan and thus warned me to leave it out of reference and plain she knew that I stood under some criminal suspicion I judged besides that the harshness of her last speech which besides she had followed up immediately with a very noisy piece of music was to put an end to the present conversation I stood beside her affecting to listen and admire but truly whirled away by my own thoughts I have always found this young lady to be a lover of the mysterious and certainly this first interview made a mystery that was beyond my plummet One thing I learned long after the hours of the Sunday had been well employed the bank porter had been found and examined my visit to Charles Stewart was [pg ]discovered and the deduction made that I was pretty deep with James and Alan and most likely in a continued correspondence with the last Hence this broad hint that was given me across the harpsichord In the midst of the piece of music one of the younger misses who was at a window over the close cried on her sisters to come quick for there was Grey eyes again The whole family trooped there at once and crowded one another for a look The window whither they ran was in an odd corner of that room gave above the entrance door and flanked up the close Come Mr Balfour they cried come and see She is the most beautiful creature She hangs round the close head these last days always with some wretched like gillies and yet seems quite a lady I had no need to look neither did I look twice or long I was afraid she might have seen me there looking down upon her from that chamber of music and she without and her father in the same house perhaps begging for his life with tears and myself come but newly from rejecting his petitions But even that glance set me in a better conceit of myself and much less awe of the young ladies They were beautiful that was beyond question but Catriona was beautiful too and had a kind of brightness in her like a coal of fire As much as the others cast me down she lifted me up I remembered I had talked easily with her If I could make no hand of it with these fine maids it was perhaps [pg ]something their own fault My embarrassment began to be a little mingled and lightened with a sense of fun and when the aunt smiled at me from her embroidery and the three daughters unbent to me like a baby all with papa s orders written on their faces there were times when I could have found it in my heart to smile myself Presently papa returned the same kind happy like pleasant spoken man Now girls said he I must take Mr Balfour away again but I hope you have been able to persuade him to return where I shall be always gratified to find him So they each made me a little farthing compliment and I was led away If this visit to the family had been meant to soften my resistance it was the worst of failures I was no such ass but what I understood how poor a figure I had made and that the girls would be yawning their jaws off as soon as my stiff back was turned I felt I had shown how little I had in me of what was soft and graceful and I longed for a chance to prove that I had something of the other stuff the stern and dangerous Well I was to be served to my desire for the scene to which he was conducting me was of a different character alas int Alas The window is broken Alas the truth is less romantic
