All that the poets from the beginning of time have written about light could not express my joy as I saw that glimmer approaching on the left Before it appeared I had been awed by the tempest benumbed with cold shivering in my wet clothes and a prey to many terrible fears and surmises but now I cried Cheer up here comes a light Then in my gladness I shouted the greeting that met Mr Jones everywhere How are YOU JOHN A great guffaw of laughter mingled with the howl of the storm and my neighbor s voice followed from the obscurity That s famous keepin up your courage like a soldier Oh I won t brag about keeping up my courage Guess you didn t know what had become of me You re right and we didn t know what was to become of us Now aren t we nearly home For we are all half frozen Just let me spy a bit with the lantern and I ll soon tell you everything He bobbed back and forth for a moment or two like a will o the wisp Now turn sharp to the left and follow the light A great hope sprung up in my heart and I hushed Winnie s and Bobsey s crying by saying Listen and you ll soon hear some good news Our wheels crunched through the deep snow for a few moments and soon I saw a ruddy light shining from the window of a dwelling and then Mr Jones shouted Whoa Light down neighbors you re at your own door There was a chorus of delighted cries Merton half tumbled over me in his eagerness to get down A door opened and out poured a cheerful glow Oh the delicious sense of safety and warmth given by it already I seized Mousie floundered through the snow up to my knees and placed her in a big rocking chair Mr Jones followed with Winnie and Merton came in with Bobsey on his back The little fellow was under such headway in crying that he couldn t stop at once although his tears were rapidly giving place to laughter I rushed back and carried in my wife and then said in a voice a little unsteady from deep feeling Welcome home one and all Never did the word mean more to a half frozen and badly frightened family At first safety warmth and comfort were the uppermost in our thoughts but as wraps were taken off and my wife and children thawed out eager eyed curiosity began to make explorations Taking Mousie on my lap and chafing her hands I answered questions and enjoyed to the full the exclamations of pleasure Mr Jones lingered for a few moments then gave one of his big guffaws by way of preface and said Well you do look as if you was at home and meant to stay This ere scene kinder makes me homesick so I ll say good night and I ll be over in the mornin There s some lunch on the table that my wife fixed up for you I must go for I hear John junior hollerin for me His only response to our profuse thanks was another laugh which the wind swept away Who is John junior asked Merton Mr Jones s son a boy of about your age He was here waiting for us and keeping the fire up When we arrived he came out and took the horses and so you didn t see him He ll make a good playmate for you To use his father s own words He s a fairish boy as boys go and that from John Jones means that he s a good fellow Oh what a happy group we were as we gathered around the great open fire on which I piled more wood Do you wish to go and look around a little I asked my wife No she replied leaning back in her rocking chair let me take this in first O Robert I have such a sense of rest quiet comfort and hominess that I just want to sit still and enjoy it all The howling of the storm only makes this place seem more like a refuge and I d rather hear it than the Daggetts tramping overhead and the Ricketts children crying down stairs Oh isn t it nice to be by ourselves in this quaint old room Turn the lamp down Robert so we can see the firelight flicker over everything Isn t it splendid just like a picture in a book No picture in a book Winifred no artist could paint a picture that would have the charm of this one for me I replied leaning my elbow on the end of the mantel piece and looking fondly down on the little group My wife s face looked girlish in the ruddy light Mousie gazed into the fire with unspeakable content and declared she was too happy to think of taking cold Winnie and Bobsey were sitting Turk fashion on the floor their eyelids drooping The long cold ride had quenched even their spirit for after running around for a few moments they began to yield to drowsiness Merton with a boy s appetite was casting wistful glances at the lunch on the table the chief feature of which was a roast chicken There seemed to be no occasion for haste I wished to let the picture sink deep into my heart At last my wife sprang up and said I ve been sentimental long enough You re not of much account in the house Robert with one of her saucy looks and I must see to things or Winnie and Bobsey will be asleep on the floor I feel as if I could sit here till morning but I ll come back after the children are in bed Come show me my home or at least enough of it to let me see where we are to sleep We shall have to camp again to night Mrs Jones has made up the one bed left in the house and you and Mousie shall have that We ll fix Winnie and Bobsey on the lounge and youngsters you can sleep in your clothes just as soldiers do on the ground Merton and I will doze in these chairs before the fire To morrow night we can all be very comfortable I took the lamp and led the way my wife Mousie and Merton following first across a little hall from which one stairway led to the upper chambers and another to the cellar Opening a door opposite the living room I showed Winifred her parlor Cosey and comfortable it looked even now through Mr and Mrs Jones s kind offices A Morning Glory stove gave out abundant warmth and a rich light which blended genially with the red colors of the carpet Oh how pretty I can make this room look exclaimed my wife Of course you can you ve only to enter it You hurt your head when you fell out of the wagon Robert and are a little daft There s no place to sleep here Come to the room over this warmed by a pipe from this stove Ah this is capital she cried looking around an apartment which Mrs Jones had made comfortable Wasn t I wise when I decided to come home It s just as warm as toast Now let the wind blow Why I don t hear it any more No the gale has blown itself out Finding that we had escaped it got discouraged and gave up Connected with this room is another for Mousie and Winnie By leaving the door open much of the time it will be warm enough for them So you see this end of the house can be heated with but little trouble and expense The open fire in the living room is a luxury that we can afford since there is plenty of wood on the place On the other side of the hall there is a room for Merton Now do me a favor don t look or talk or think any more to night It has been a long hard day Indeed looking at my watch it is already to morrow morning and you know how much we shall have to do Let us go back and get a little supper and then take all the rest we can Winifred yielded and Bobsey and Winnie waked up for a time at the word supper Then we knelt around our hearth and made it an altar to God for I wished the children never to forget our need of His fatherly care and help I will now take the children upstairs and put them to bed and then come back for I can not leave this wood fire just yet remarked my wife I burst out laughing and said You have never been at home until this night when you are camping in an old house you never saw before and I can prove it by one question When have you taken the children UPSTAIRS to bed before Why why never Of course you haven t city flats all your life But your nature is not perverted In natural homes for generations mothers have taken their children upstairs to bed and forgetting the habit of your life you speak according to the inherited instinct of the mother heart O Robert you have so many fine spun theories Yet it is a little queer It seemed just as natural for me to say upstairs as As it was for your mother grandmother and great grandmother Very well We are in such an old house that I suppose I shall begin to look and act like my great grandmother But no more theories to night nothing but rest and the wood fire She soon joined me at the hearth again Merton meanwhile had stretched himself on the rag carpet with his overcoat for a pillow and was in dreamless sleep My wife s eyes were full of languor She did not sit down but stood beside me for a moment Then laying her head on my shoulder she said softly I haven t brains enough for theories and such things but I will try to make you all happy here Dear little wife I laughed when has woman hit upon a higher or better wisdom than that of making all happy in her own home and you half asleep too Then I ll bid you good night at once before I say something awfully stupid Soon the old house was quiet The wind had utterly ceased I opened the door a moment and looked on the white still world without The stars glittered frostily through the rifts in the clouds Schunemunk Mountain was a shadow along the western horizon and the eastern highlands banked up and blended with the clouds Nature has its restless moods its storms and passions like human life but there are times of tranquillity and peace even in March How different was this scene from the aspect of our city street when I had taken my farewell look at a late hour the previous night No grand sweeping outlines there no deep quiet and peace soothing and at the same time uplifting the mind Even at midnight there is an uneasy fretting in city life some one not at rest and disturbing the repose of others I stole silently through the house Here too all seemed in accord with nature The life of a good old man had quietly ceased in this home new hopeful life was beginning Evil is everywhere in the world but it seemed to me that we had as safe a nook as could be found He Fell In Love With His Wife Allan
