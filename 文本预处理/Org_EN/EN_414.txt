Miss Stone sat by the boy on the lawn at Idlewood A great canopy of khaki duck was spread above them and the boy lay on a wicker couch that could be lifted and carried from place to place as the wind or the sun or a whim directed Five days they had been here every day full of sunshine and the fragrance of flowers from the garden that ran along the terraces from the house to the river bank and was a riot of midsummer colour and scent The boy s face had gained clear freshness and his eyes fixed on Miss Stone s face glowed I like it here he said Yes Alcie Miss Stone bent toward him You are getting strong every day you will soon be able to walk to morrow perhaps She glanced at the thin legs under their light covering The boy laughed a little and moved them I can walk now he declared But she shook her head No I will tell you a story So her voice went on and on in the summer quiet insects buzzed faintly playing the song of the day Bees bumbled among the flowers and flew past laden The boy s eyes followed them The shadow of a crow s wing dropped on the grass and drifted by The summer day held itself and Miss Stone s voice wove a dream through it When the boy opened his eyes again she was sitting very quiet her hands in her lap her eyes fixed on the river that flowed beyond the garden The boy s eyes studied her face Once I saw you he said His hand stole out and touched the grey dress Miss Stone started They had waited a long time but not for this Yes Alcie once you saw me go on saw you in a carriage finished Alcie with quick smile You ride straight you straight now He looked at her with devoted eyes Yes She was holding her breath very evenly and she did not look at him but at the distant river They seemed held in a charm a word might break it The boy breathed a happy sigh that bubbled forth I like it here he said dreamily Should she speak The long silence spread between them The bird sang in the wood a clear mid summer call The boy listened and turned his eyes A little girl with you then he said softly in carriage Where is little girl It was the first question he had asked She swayed a little in her grey softness but she did not look at him but at the river You would like that little girl Alcie she said quietly We all love her Some day you shall see her only get well and you shall see her It was a soft word like a cry and the boy looked at her with curious eyes I get well he said contentedly I see her He slipped a hand under his cheek and lay quiet Doing well said the surgeon couldn t be better He had run down for the day and was to go back in the cool evening He stood with Philip Harris on the terrace overlooking the river Harris threw away a stump of cigar You think he will make complete recovery No doubt of it said the surgeon promptly Then Philip Harris turned a quick eye on him But the man shook his head Wait he said and again slowly wait The darkness closed around them but they did not break it A faint questioning honk sounded and Philip Harris turned The car is ready he said to take you back canopy n The trees formed a leafy canopy above their heads They lay down under a canopy of stars whim n I bought the encyclopedia on a whim He had a sudden whim to go sailing today fragrance n The apple blossoms filled the air with their fragrance The fragrance of lavender filled the room scent n v The air was filled with the scent of lilac The flowers give off a heady scent at night fixed adj Have you two fixed on a date for the wedding yet Once the aim is fixed we should not change it arbitrarily bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them laden adj He is laden with heavy responsibility Dragging the fully laden boat across the sand dunes was no mean feat devoted adj He devoted his life to the educational cause of the motherland We devoted a lengthy and full discussion to this topic forth adv The wind moved the trees gently back and forth He gave forth a series of works in rapid succession contentedly adv My father sat puffing contentedly on his pipe This is brother John s writing said Sally contentedly as she opened the letter stump n v He went on the stump in his home state He used the stump as a table promptly adv He paid the money back promptly She promptly seized the opportunity his absence gave her honk n Don t honk the horn indiscriminately While passing another vehicle you must honk your horn
