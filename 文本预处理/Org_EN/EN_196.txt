When I was thirteen years old we lost our ally Martha Loring She had been with us since she was fifteen at first a little scullery maid Later she was promoted and became a person much trusted in spite of her youth and her love of fun We had all sorts of games and private understandings with Martha She was a genius at furnishing a dolls house She got another friend of ours to make us a dresser for Alexandra s kitchen This other gifted person was Peter one of Big Klaus s sons He was almost twenty and he used to bring the vegetables We did not know why he could never bring us our presents at the same time perhaps out of fear of the cook who held strict views upon the wickedness of eating between meals She was elderly and very easily annoyed She never knew that that clever Peter circumvented her by climbing over the orchard wall with our red apples and with pockets full of the hazelnuts we loved Martha Loring told us that if[Pg ] ever we spoke of these gifts they would be forbidden and Peter would never come any more So we were most careful So was Peter So careful that he brought his gifts after dark Martha used to have to go down the garden and wait for them wait so long sometimes that we fell asleep and only got Peter s presents in the morning Martha had laughing brown eyes and full scarlet lips No wonder we were impressed by the transformation of this cheerful and familiar presence into something heavy eyed and secret One morning she came out of our mother s room sobbing and went away without saying good bye though she wasn t ever coming back the cook said Our mother was so unwell that day she did not want even me in the room In the evening Bettina and I went into the kitchen to ask Mrs Ransom what had become of Martha Mrs Ransom was in a bad temper She said roughly that Martha had gone under Under Under what [Pg ] Mrs Ransom said Sh I went back to the kitchen alone and begged the cook to tell me what had happened She was angrier than ever and said the young ladies where she lived before never asked questions and would never have fashed themselves about a housemaid who was a horrid person I was angry too at that and told her she was jealous of Martha She chased me out with a hot frying pan We felt justified in disbelieving all Mrs Ransom had said when we found out that Martha had not gone under at all She had gone to stay with the family of Little Klaus But our mother said Little Klaus s wife ought not to have taken Martha in And she wrote Mrs Klaus a letter As for us we were never to speak to Martha again And we were not to go near Little Klaus s cottage as long as Martha stayed there Very soon she went away We were reminded of Martha whenever a beggar came to the back door or a dusty man on the heath road asked us for his fare to Brighton Martha would have told the beggar to go and wait in the first clump of gorse And she would[Pg ] have smuggled food out to him She used to borrow our threepenny bits to make up the dusty man s fare But she always paid us back I knew quite well why Mrs Klaus had been kind to Martha For a whole year the Klauses had been having bad luck One of the children died And what seemed to be much more serious something happened to the horse He died too So the Klauses had no horse at all now but they had four little children left And one or other of the children was always cutting or bruising himself or else falling ill Martha would tell me about them She and I would collect pieces of flannel or linen for bandages and Martha would take mustard over to the cottage for plasters and bread and milk for poultices The little Klauses needed a fearful lot of poultices Martha was sure of my sympathy in these ministrations because of a peculiarity of mine When I was still quite a little girl my mother had admitted my skill in making compresses I could take temperatures too and I learned how to prepare invalid foods I found a fascinating book thrust away behind Gibbon s Decline and Fall [Pg ] The book was called Household Medicine I read it a great deal especially when one of the little Klauses had a new symptom If I refrained from hoping my mother and sister might have more and worse maladies that I might nurse them back to health I would willingly have sacrificed the servants So that the diseases that attacked the little Klauses were a godsend to me I glanced at those unfortunates as I passed with the eye of the specialist Yet often to my shame I could detect no sign of their sufferings One day I heard wailing as Betty and I went by I told Betty to walk on slowly and wait by the Dew Pond And I made my first visit to Mrs Klaus She was in bed in the tiny inner room nursing the new baby Mr Klaus was sitting by the kitchen fire with his back to the door He had Jimmy in his arms Jimmy had been the baby His little face all crumpled with crying looked at me over his father s shoulder He had been like this for two days Just pining they said with the resignation of the poor We parted upon the understanding that the thing for them to do was to give Jimmy a warm bath and no tea or bacon for supper [Pg ] and the thing for me to do was to send him some proper food all of which was done in collusion with Martha I was not a secretive person but I had learned years before that my mother was unwilling that we should ever go into any of the cottages Not even for shelter in a storm were we to cross one of those thresholds I felt sure that this precaution was on Betty s account I never let Bettina go into the cottage Indeed she never wished to That instinctive shrinking from ugliness and suffering seemed quite natural in a rose leaf creature like Bettina But I was made of commoner clay And long after she had left us I missed that other piece of common clay Martha Loring The thought of Martha was specially vivid in my mind on one occasion two years or more after she went under Bettina caught one of her dreadful colds But we had made her well again so well that she insisted on going for a walk My mother wrapped her warmly and I knelt down and put on her leggings and overshoes But after all we only stayed out about ten[Pg ] minutes My mother said the air was raw and not safe At luncheon Bettina was urged to eat more Though as I say she seemed quite well again she had not recovered her appetite Her normal appetite was small and fastidious Often special dainties had to be prepared to tempt Bettina And I remember for a reason that will be obvious later I remember we had delicious things to eat that day Unluckily Bettina wasn t hungry and she grew rather fretful at being urged to eat more than she wanted My mother remembered a tonic that she sometimes made Bettina take When she had helped us to pudding she went upstairs to find the tonic because she was the only one who knew where it was The moment she had gone Bettina sprang up and scraped her favourite pudding into the fire We laughed together and recalled her evil ways as a baby Always there had been this trouble to make Bettina eat specially breakfast My mother and I used to be tired out waiting while my sister sitting in her high chair nibbled toast a crumb at a time and let her bacon grow cold So a[Pg ] punishment had to be invented Bettina who dearly loved society must be left alone to finish breakfast a plan that seemed to work for when one of us went back in a few minutes Bettina s plate would be bare Then the awful discovery one day in cleaning out a seldom opened part of the side board a great collection of toast and bits of mouldy bacon pushed quite to the back of the capacious drawer While we sat laughing over the old misdeed feeling very grown up now and superior a face looked in at the window a pinched unhappy face with hungry eyes A woman stood out there holding a baby wrapped in a shawl The window was shut for the rain had begun as we sat down heavy leaden drops out of a leaden sky I ran and opened the window What is it I said quite unnecessarily The woman told us she had started for the hop fields that morning She had no money to pay a railway fare but a man had given her a lift as far as the village She did not know how she was going to reach the hop fields At that moment I heard my mother s voice What are you doing Shut the window instantly [Pg ] And as I was not quick about it she came behind me and shut the window sharply What was I thinking of Had I no regard for my little sister sitting there in the current of raw air Really she had thought me old enough by now to be trusted Seldom had I been so scolded I forgot for a moment about the woman I remembered her only when I saw my mother make a gesture over my head Go away Oh but she is tired and wet I said and I tried to tell her story My mother interrupted me Hop pickers were a very low class They were dirty and verminous and spread infectious diseases Go away she said And again that gesture I felt myself choking She is hungry I whispered My mother measured out the tonic My first misgiving about her shook the foundations of existence Other lesser instances came back to me strange lapses into hardness on the part of so tender a being What did they mean If I scratched my arm she would fly for a soothing lotion and help healing with soft words If[Pg ] Bettina pinched her finger the whole house would be stirred up to sympathise No smallest ache or ailing of ours but our mother s sensitiveness shared And yet The woman with her burden had moved away a draggled figure in the rain A horrible feeling sprang up in my heart an impulse of actual hatred towards my mother as the hop picker disappeared Hatred of Bettina too I kept thinking of the pudding in the fire And of Martha Loring If Martha Loring had been in the kitchen she would somehow have got food to the woman and a few pence The image of Martha Loring shone bright above the greyness of that wretched time Looking back I say to myself Not all in vain perhaps the life of the little servant who had been turned out of doors At Duncombe where she had had her time of happiness where she had served and suffered something of her spirit still survived Martha Loring sat that day in judgment on my mother And I was torn with the misery of having to admit the sentence just [Pg ] I became critical of matters never questioned before I fell foul of Bettina She was selfish She was vain And her hair was turning pink It was true that the paler gold of early childhood was warming to a sort of apricot shade infinitely lovely But pink hair was accounted libellous And anyhow it was a crime to tease Bettina Wasn t it worse I demanded groping among the new perceptions dawning wasn t it worse for Bettina to tease a dumb animal The worse I was shrewd to note was not admitted But Of course Bettina must not tease the cat With unloving eyes I watched my mother lift an ugly black spider very gently in a handkerchief and put the creature out to safety But that haggard hop picker no I couldn t understand it The hop picker haunted me Then I made a compact with her For her sake I would contrive somehow to give bread to any hungry man or woman who should go by And so I addressed the hop picker in my thoughts though you had no bread for yourself [Pg ] you will be the means of giving bread to others The hop picker accepted the arrangement Peace came back In the vague pagan fashion of the young I thought too that by kind deeds I might pay off my mother s score Her fears for us somehow prevented her from feeling for other people s children Something I didn t know about had made her like that In my struggle to resolve the discord between a nagging conscience and my adoration for my mother I seemed to leave childhood behind Still very dimly if at all could I have realised there was any connection between her continued shrinking from our fellow creatures and that old nameless fear we used to bar the door against Yet in one guise or another Fear still was
