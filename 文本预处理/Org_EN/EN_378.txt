It was rather fun shopping for Leslie Leslie was a stout quiet ponderous person between thirty and forty and he really did not bound at all Urquhart had done him less than justice in his description There was about him the pathos of the very rich He was generous in the extreme and Peter s job proved lucrative as well as pleasant He grew curiously fond of Leslie his attitude towards him was one of respect touched with protectiveness No one should any more do Leslie if he could help it He s let me Peter told his cousin Lucy get rid of all his horrible Lowestoft forgeries awful things they were with the blue hardly dry on them Frightful cheek selling him things like that it s so insulting Leslie s awfully sweet tempered about being gulled though He s very kind to me he lets me buy anything I like for him And he recommends me to his friends too It s a splendid profession I m so glad I thought of it If I hadn t I should have had to go into a dye shop or be a weaver or something It wouldn t have been good form it wouldn t even have been clean I should have had a day before yesterday s handkerchief and Rodney would have liked me more but Denis would probably have cut me As it is I m quite good form and quite clean and I move in the best circles I love the Ignorant Rich they re so amusing I know such a nice lady She buys potato rings She likes them to be Dublin hall marked and clearly dated seventeen hundred and something so naturally they always were till I began to buy them for her I ve persuaded her to give away the most blatant forgeries to her god children at their baptisms Babies like them sham or genuine Peter was having tea with his cousin Lucy and Urquhart in the White City Peter and Lucy were very fond of the White City Peter s cousin Lucy was something like a small gay spring flower with wide solemn grey eyes that brimmed with sudden laughters and a funny infectious gurgle of a laugh She was a year younger than Peter and they had all their lives gone shares in their possessions from guinea pigs to ideas They admired the same china and the same people with unquestioning unanimity Lucy lived in Chelsea with an elder sister and a father who ran at his own expense a revolutionary journal that didn t pay because those who would have liked to buy it couldn t for the most part afford to and because those who could have afforded to didn t want to and because in short journals run by nice people never do pay Lucy played the cello the instrument usually selected by the small in stature In the intervals of this pursuit she went about the world open eyed to all new burnished joys that came within her vision and lived by admiration hope and love and played with Peter at any game wise or foolish that turned up Often Urquhart played with them and they were a happy party of three Peter and Lucy shared among other things an admiration of Urquhart Peter was finding the world delightful just now This first winter in London was probably the happiest time he ever had He hardly missed Cambridge he certainly didn t miss the money that the Robinsons had His profession was to touch and handle the things he loved the Ignorant Rich were delightful the things he bought for them were beyond all words the sales he attended were revels of joy it was all extremely entertaining and Leslie a dear and everyone very kind The affection that always found its way to Peter through his disabilities spoke for something in him that must it would seem be there possibly it was merely his friendly smile He was anyhow of the genus comedian that readily endears itself He and Urquhart and Lucy all knew how to live They made good use of most of the happy resources that London offers to its inhabitants They went in steamers to and fro between Putney and Greenwich listening to concertinas and other instruments of music They looked at many sorts of pictures talked to many sorts of people and attended many sorts of plays Urquhart and Peter had even become associates of the Y M C A representing themselves as agnostics seeking for light on account of the swimming baths As Peter remarked Christian Young Men do not bathe very much and it seems a pity no one should On the day when they had tea at the White City they had all had lunch at a very recherch caf in Soho where the Smart Set like to meet Bohemians and you can only get in by being one or the other so Peter and Lucy went as the Smart Set and Urquhart as a Bohemian and they liked to meet each other very much The only drawback to Peter s life was the bronchitis that sprang at him out of the fogs and temporarily stopped work He had just recovered from an attack of it on the day when he was having tea at the White City and he looked a weak and washed out rag with sunken blue eyes smiling out of a very white face You would think to look at him Urquhart said to Lucy that he had been going in extensively for the flip flap this afternoon It s a pity Stephen can t see you Margery you look starved enough to satisfy even him You never come across Stephen now I suppose You wouldn t of course He has no opinion of the Ignorant Rich Nor even of the well informed rich like me He s blindly prejudiced in favour of the Ignorant Poor Lucy nodded I know He s nice to me always I go and play my cello to his friends I always keep him in mind said Peter for the day when my patrons get tired of me I know Rodney will be kind to me directly I take to street peddling or any other thoroughly ill bred profession The kind he despises most I suppose are my dear Ignorant Rich the ill bred but by no means breadless That s my own and not very funny by the way Did I tell you Denis that Leslie is going to begin educating the People in Appreciation of Objects of Art Isn t it a nice idea I m to help Leslie s a visionary you know I believe plutocrats often are They ve so much money and are so comfortable that they stop wanting material things and begin dreaming dreams I should dream dreams if I was a plutocrat As it is my mind is earthly I don t want to educate anyone Well anyhow we re going to Italy in the spring to pick things up as Leslie puts it That always sounds so much as if we didn t pay for them Then we shall bring them home and have free exhibits for the Ignorant Poor and I shall give free and instructive lectures Isn t it a pleasant plan We re going to Venice There s a Berovieri goblet that some Venetian count has that Leslie s set his heart on We are to acquire it regardless of expense if it turns out to be all that is rumoured Urquhart scoffed here Nice to be infallible isn t it You and your goblets and your Ignorant Rich And your brother Hilary and my uncle Evelyn Your great gifts seem to run in the family My uncle I hear is ruining himself with buying the things your brother admires My poor uncle Miss Hope is getting so weak sighted that he can t judge for himself as he used so he follows the advice of Margery s brother It keeps him very happy and amused though he ll soon be bankrupt no doubt Lucy as usual laughed at the Urquhart family and the Margerison family and the world at large When she laughed she opened her grey eyes wide while they twinkled with dancing light Then she said Oh I want to go on the flip flap Peter mustn t come because it always makes him sick so will you Urquhart said he would so they did and Peter watched them hoping Urquhart didn t mind much Urquhart never seemed to mind being ordered about by Lucy And Lucy of course had accepted him as an intimate friend from the first because Peter had said she was to and because as she remarked he was so astonishingly nice to look at and to listen to Among the visitors who frequented Lucy s home people whom she considered astonishingly pleasant to look at and to listen to did not abound so Lucy enjoyed the change all the more The first time Peter took Urquhart down to Chelsea to call on his Hope uncle and cousins one Sunday afternoon he gave him a succinct account of the sort of people they would probably meet there They have oddities in you know and particularly on Sunday afternoons They usually have one or two staying in the house too They keep open house for wastrels A lot of them are aliens Polish refugees Russian anarchists oppressed Finns massacred Armenians who do embroidery violinists who can t earn a living decayed chimney sweeps and so forth Disillusioned or still illusioned geniuses would bes theorists artistic natures failed reformers knaves and fools incompetent or over old broken evangelists and debauchees inebriates criminals cowards virtual slaves Anyhow it s a home for Lost Hopes Do you see that My uncle is keen on anyone who tries to revolt against anything governments Russians proprieties or anything else and Felicity is keen on anyone who fails And your other cousin what is she keen on Oh Lucy s too young for the Oddities like me She and I sit in a corner and look on It s my uncle and Felicity they like to talk to They talk about Liberty to them you know My uncle is great on Liberty And they give them lemon in their tea and say how wicked Russians are and how stupid Royal Academicians are and buy the Armenians embroidery and so forth Lucy and I don t do that well I disapprove of liberty for most people I think and certainly for them and I don t like lemon in my tea and though I m sure Russians are wicked I believe oppressed Poles are as bad at least their hair is as bushy and their nails as long and I prefer the embroidery I do myself I do it quite nicely I think And I don t consider that Celtic poets or Armenian Christians wash their hands often enough They nearly all asked me the time last Sunday I was sorry about it You feared they were finding their afternoon tedious No but I think their watches were up the spout you see So I was sorry I never feel so sorry for myself as when mine is I m really awfully grateful to Leslie if it wasn t for him I should never be able to tell anyone the time By the way Leslie s awfully fond of Felicity He writes her enormous cheques for her clubs and vagabonds and so on But of course she ll never look at him he s much too well off It s not low to tell you that because he makes it so awfully obvious He ll probably be there this afternoon Oh here we are They found the Hopes small drawing room filled much as Peter had predicted Dermot Hope was a tall wasted looking man of fifty five with brilliant eyes giving significance to a vague face He had very little money and spent that little on Progress whose readers were few and ardent and whose contributors were very cosmopolitan and full of zeal and fire several of them were here this afternoon Dermot Hope himself was most unconquerably full of fire He could be delightful and exceedingly disagreeable full of genial sympathy and appreciation and of a biting irony He looked at Urquhart whom he met for the first time with a touch of sarcasm in his smile He said You re exactly like your father How do you do and seemed to take no further interest in him He had certainly never taken much in Lord Hugh during the brief year of their brotherhood For Peter his glance was indulgent Peter not being himself a reformer or an idealist or a lover of progress or even according to himself of liberty but an acceptor of things as they are and a lover of the good things of this world was not particularly interesting to his uncle of course but being rather an endearing boy and the son of a beloved sister he was loved and even had he been a stranger his position would have been regarded as more respectable than Urquhart s since he had so far failed to secure many good things Felicity a gracious and lovely person of twenty nine gave Peter and Urquhart a smile out of her violet eyes and murmured Lucy s in the corner over there and resumed the conversation she was trying to divide between Joseph Leslie and a young English professor who was having a holiday from stirring up revolutions at a Polish university The division was not altogether easy even to a person of Felicity s extraordinary tact particularly as they both happened to be in love with her Felicity had a great deal of listening to do always because everyone told her about themselves and she always heard them gladly if she hastened the end a little sometimes gently they never knew it She in fact wanted to hear about them as much really as much though the desire in these proportions is so rare as to seem incredible as they wanted to let her hear Her wish to hear was a temptation to egotism those who disliked egotism in themselves had to fight the temptation and seldom won She did not believe no one but a fool and she was not that could have believed all the many things that were told her the many things that must always while pity and the need to be pitied endure be told to the pitiful but she seldom said so She merely looked at the teller with her long and lovely violet eyes that took in so much and gave out such continual friendship and saw how behind the lies the need dwelt pleading Then she gave not necessarily what the lies asked for but what in her opinion pity owed to that which pleaded She certainly gave as a rule quite too much in whatever coin she paid That was inevitable You give from the emotions Joseph Leslie told her instead of from reason How bad for you how bad for them And worse when it is friendship than when it is coin that you can count and set a limit to Yes Abominably bad for everyone concerned Should one wondered Felicity give friendship as one is supposed to give money on C O S principles Perhaps so I must think about it But her thinking always brought her back to the same conclusion as before Consequently her circle of friends grew and grew She even included in it a few of the rich and prosperous not wishing her chain of fellowship whose links she kept in careful repair to fail anywhere But it showed strain there It was forged and flung by the rich and prosperous and merely accepted by Felicity Leslie though rich and prosperous stepped into the linked circle led by Peter who was neither Having money and a desire to make himself conscious of the fact by using it he consulted Miss Hope as to how best to be philanthropic He wanted it seemed to be a philanthropist as well as a collector and felt incapable of being either otherwise than through agents His personal share in both enterprises had to be limited to the backing capital Miss Hope said Start a settlement and he had said I can t unless you ll work it for me Will you So he started a settlement and she worked it for him and he came about the place and got in the way and wrote heavy cheques and adored Felicity and suggested at suitable intervals that she should marry him Felicity had no intention of marrying him She called him a rest No one likes being called a rest when they desire to be a stimulant or even a gentle excitement Felicity was an immense excitement to Mr Leslie though he concealed it laboriously under a heavy and matter of fact exterior and it is of course pleasanter when these things are reciprocal But Mr Leslie perceived that she took much more interest even in her young cousin Peter than in him Do you find him a useful little boy she asked him this afternoon before Peter and Urquhart arrived Leslie nodded Useful boy very And pleasant company you know I don t know much about these things but he seems to have a splendid eye for a good thing Funny thing is it works all round in all departments Native genius not training He sees a horse between a pair of shafts in a country lane looks at it says That s good That would have a fair chance for the Grand National Urquhart buys it for fifty pounds straight away and it does win the Grand National And he knows nothing special about horses either That s what I call genius It s the same eye that makes him spot a dusty old bit of good china on a back shelf of a shop among a crowd of forged rubbish I ve none of that sort of sense I m hopeless But I like good things and I can pay for them and I give that boy a free rein He s furnishing my house well for me It seems to amuse him rather He loves it said Felicity His love of pleasant things is what he lives by Including among them Denis Urquhart of course Yes Leslie pursed thoughtful lips over Denis Urquhart He was perhaps slightly touched with jealousy there He was himself rather drawn towards that tranquil young man but he knew very well that the drawing was one sided Urquhart was patently undrawn Rather a flash lot the Urquharts aren t they he said and Peter who liked him would have had to admit that the remark was perilously near to a bound Seem to have a sort of knack of dazzling people He s an attractive person of course Miss Hope replied and she didn t say it distantly she was so sorry for people who bounded and so many of her friends did It s pleasing to see isn t it such whole souled devotion Mr Leslie grunted I won t say pearls before swine because Urquhart isn t a swine but a very pleasant ordinary young fellow But worship like that can t be deserved you know not by anyone however beautifully he motors through life Margerison s too well too nice to put it simply to give himself to another person body and soul like that It s squandering And irritates you she reflected but merely said Is squandering always a bad thing I wonder It was at this point that Peter and Urquhart came in Directed by Felicity to Lucy in an obscure corner they found her being talked to by one of the Oddities he looked rather like an oppressed Finn He was talking and she was listening wide eyed and ingenuous her small hands clasped on her lap Peter and Urquhart sat down by her and the oppressed Finn presently wandered away to talk to Lucy s father Lucy gave a little sigh of relief Wish they wouldn t come and talk to me she said I m no good to them I don t understand and I hate people to be unhappy I m dreadfully sorry they are I don t want to have to think about them Why can t they be happy There are so many nice things all about Tis such waste She looked up at Urquhart and her eyes laughed because he was happy and clean and shone like a new pin It s nicest she said to be happy and clean And it s not bad to be happy and dirty or very bad to be unhappy and clean but She shut her lips with a funny distaste on the remaining alternative And I m horribly afraid Felicity s going to get engaged to Mr Malyon that young one talking to her do you see He helps with conspiracies in Poland But he s quite clean said Urquhart looking at him Lucy admitted that But he ll get sent to Siberia soon don t you see and Felicity will go too I know Peter said If I was Felicity I d marry Leslie I wouldn t hesitate for a moment I wish it was me he loved so Fancy marrying into all those lovely things I m getting for him Only I hope she won t because then she d take over the shopping department and I should be left unemployed Oh Lucy he s let me buy him the heavenliest pair of Chelsea jardini res shaped like orange tubs with Cupids painted on blue panels You must come and see them soon Lucy s eyes seeing the delightful things widened and danced She loved the things Peter bought Suddenly Peter who had a conscience somewhere felt a pang in it and to ease it regretfully left the corner and wandered about among his uncle s friends being pleasant and telling them the time He did that till the last of them had departed Urquhart then had to depart also and Peter was alone with his relatives It was only after Urquhart had gone that Peter realised fully what a very curious and incongruous element he had been in the room Realising it suddenly he laughed and Lucy laughed too Felicity looked at them indulgently Babies What s the matter now Only Denis explained Peter That young man commented Dermot Hope without approbation is remarkably well fed well bred and well dressed Why do you take him about with you That s just why isn t it Peter put in Lucy Peter and I like people to be well fed and well bred and well dressed Felicity touched her chin with her indulgent smile Baby again You like no such thing You d get tired of it in a week Oh well said Lucy a week s a long time He s got no fire in all his soul and body complained Dermot Hope He s a symbol of prosperous content of all we re fighting It s people like him who are the real obstructionists the people who don t see not because they re blind but because they re too pleased with their own conditions to look beyond them It s people like him who are pouring water on the fires as they are lit because fires are such bad form and might burn up their precious chattels if allowed to get out of hand Take life placidly don t get excited it s so vulgar that s their religion They ve neither enthusiasm nor imagination in them And so And so forth just as it came out in Progress once a month Peter didn t read Progress because he wasn t interested in the future being essentially a child of to day Besides he too hated conflagrations thinking the precious chattels they would burn up much too precious for that Peter was no lover either of destruction or construction perhaps he too was an obstructionist though not without imagination His uncle knew he had a regrettable tendency to put things in the foreground and keep ideas very much in the background and called him therefore a phenomenalist Lucy shared this tendency being a good deal of an artist and nothing at all of a philosopher ponderous adj His steps were heavy and ponderous
