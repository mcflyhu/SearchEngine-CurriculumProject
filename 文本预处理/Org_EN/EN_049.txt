After that significant hint Madame Coralie refused to speak any more alleging that she was extremely busy and could not afford the time However she told her niece to call and see her again when she would be more explicit Meanwhile the girl was obliged to return to her lover with what meagre information she had gleaned Passing through the perfumed shop now crowded with fashionable women she rejoined Ralph on the pavement Together they strolled up Walpole Lane in the direction of Kensington Palace I told my aunt as you suggested about my father s intention to marry Miss Pearl said Audrey abruptly And you are right She is jealous Strange is it not after all these years Besides Audrey shrugged her shoulders in a contemptuous way fancy any woman remaining faithful to my father Women have odd tastes said Shawe quietly and your father is so masterful a man that he is certain to be successful with the fair sex Humph She is jealous is she Well and what did she say Very little It was her manner of speaking more than what she said When I told her you should have seen her eyes flash above the yashmak Oh never mind her eyes flashing Audrey said Shawe impatiently What were her words All she said was that Rosy Pearl was the customer who slept at the Pink Shop on the night of the crime What Ralph stopped suddenly and stared The lady who refused to allow her name to be given who slept in the upstairs bedroom Yes And I think that my aunt means to hint Oh I see what she means interrupted Ralph quickly Her jealousy gives the hint very plainly Rosy Pearl was in the house Rosy Pearl wants to become the second Lady Branwin so Rosy Pearl gets rid of No no interrupted Audrey in her turn and looking pale I can t think that she strangled my mother She had every reason to said Ralph grimly And as Madame Coralie admits that she has the diamonds robbery cannot now be given as the motive for the committal of the crime Do you believe that Rosy Pearl really did murder my mother so that the way might be opened to her to be my father s second wife I can t say for certain until I examine into the matter more closely said Shawe anxiously but it certainly looks like it Sir Joseph is a millionaire and from the sudden way in which he announced his intention of making her his wife it is evident that the two discussed the matter while your mother was still alive He paused and thought for a few minutes I tell you what Audrey I shall go at once to Perry Toat and tell her this Can I come also asked Audrey again feeling the detective fever No It is just as wise not to arouse your father s suspicions Why should they be aroused asked Audrey quickly He knows nothing of Rosy Pearl s doings on that night No I daresay he doesn t replied Shawe turning away his face but if he thought that you were looking into this case and that Miss Pearl was suspected he might make trouble Go back home Audrey my darling and leave me to deal with the matter Very well but you must promise to come and tell me all about it Meet me at the usual place in the Gardens to morrow afternoon at three Yes Ralph glanced at his watch I must get a taxi and drive as hard as I can to Buckingham Street or Miss Toat may leave her office It s after five o clock as it is What are you going to do exactly Ralph asked Audrey detaining him Explain matters to Perry Toat and ask her to look up Miss Pearl said the young man hastily and fairly ran away from the girl Audrey returned to her home filled with anxious fears There was something strange about her lover s unwillingness to discuss matters freely with her Also she could not conceive why he wished her to obey the instructions of the anonymous letter and abandon all further search for the assassin With the instinct of a woman in love she felt that there was a veil between her and Ralph But why there should be she could not conceive The only thing to be done is to wait patiently Audrey thought as she dressed for dinner Sooner or later I shall learn why Ralph is behaving so strangely Meanwhile Shawe never thinking that Audrey was puzzled by his odd reluctance had found Perry Toat on the point of leaving her office When he breathlessly explained his errand she sat down to gather details The idea that Rosy Pearl had been sleeping in the Pink Shop on the night when Lady Branwin had been murdered revealed matters in a new light Had she known about the diamonds being in Madame Coralie s possession she might have been still more certain but since Ralph had solemnly promised Audrey to keep silent on this particular point he could not impart all his suspicions to the detective However she learnt enough to suggest the building up of another and more feasible theory Of course Rosy Pearl s desire to become Lady Branwin the second provides a strong motive for the commission of the crime But we don t know that Miss Pearl is anxious to marry Sir Joseph He is anxious to marry her but that is quite a different thing Miss Pearl to my knowledge is a woman who has always had an eye to the main chance said Perry Toat drily She has kept herself highly respectable so that she might make a good match Branwin is wealthy and can give her rank and position She would do much to become his wife Would she commit a murder asked Shawe doubtfully She might and she might not I can say nothing more until I learn precisely what she was doing on that night How can you learn I shall question Parizade The blind girl What can she tell I don t know but I shall be able to get all information from her whatever she may know But being blind she can see nothing She may have heard something said Perry Toat with emphasis Having lost her eyesight her hearing has become very keen and also she has a very powerful sense of smell What Ralph joked do you expect her to nose the trail like a dog I don t know what I expect but the fact is Mr Shawe I have made friends with all the four girls in the shop Madame Coralie for her own sake will say nothing but if those girls know anything I may induce them to speak Badoura Miss Toat ticked off the names on her fingers can be worked by appealing to her jealousy as she loves Eddy Vail Zobeide who is deaf is anxious to get money and retire with her mother whom she dearly loves to the seaside Peri Banou is an extravagant little minx who is always in want of cash while Parizade has a lover Really Ralph expressed his astonishment But she is blind She is pretty and the man who loves her is an artist Now if I offer to share the reward of one thousand pounds with any one of these girls I may learn much in fact I am going to the shop to see Parizade to night I thought you had learnt all you wished to learn from her said Shawe uneasily He had been told on a previous occasion what the blind girl knew and the information had not pleased him I wish to check her statements said Miss Toat quickly However to morrow something may be learnt worth your hearing from Badoura She is one of the witnesses for the alibi and I intend to ask her at what time Madame Coralie left the still room to see Miss Branwin at the door of the shop But I don t quite see How can you Mr Shawe You are not a detective Everyone to his trade Her trade corrected the barrister quietly as a return for the snub However I shall see you to morrow and I trust that you will have something to tell me I shall do my best I can t do more replied Perry Toat with a shrug And with this mild assurance the young man was obliged to be content Perry Toat had already arranged her plans She had learnt on the previous day from Badoura with whom she was in communication that Madame Coralie was going to the theatre with her husband that evening Therefore when she arrived in Walpole Lane she was not surprised to find the forewoman in a bad temper This was natural seeing that she loved Eddy Vail to such an extent that she resented his going out with his lawful wife This was illogical but Badoura having been tricked into caring for the handsome scamp was far past reason I wish I hadn t fallen in love with him she wailed to Miss Toat when that businesslike lady arrived at the shop He treats me so badly What can you expect my dear As a married man he should remain true to his wife The mere fact that he pretended to love you when he should not shows the kind of profligate he is But Madame Coralie is so old said Badoura with a flush which made her look very pretty She won t live for ever and then Then you hope to marry Eddy Vail My dear girl I wouldn t count too much on that if I were you Mr Vail will do what suits him best I shall make him marry me said Badoura fiercely Can you asked Perry Toat sceptically Yes I know something What is it I shan t tell you Eddy Vail has no hold over me as I have always kept myself to myself so far as he is concerned It is only because I am in love that I make such a fool of myself But I know And she nodded Come tell me coaxed Perry Toat seeing in a flash how she could bring the girl to betray whatever she knew about Mr Vail I shan t You are a detective and I m afraid of you If I did right I should tell Madame Coralie how you come here as a spy If you do you will lose any chance of sharing the reward with me Miss Toat assured her coolly Besides the mischief is done and I know a lot But you say that you will share the reward with the other girls Of course I shall share it with anyone who can put me on the right scent to trace the murderer If you know anything she looked very straightly at Badoura remember you risk five hundred pounds by not telling me I shall tell nothing said Badoura resolutely unless Eddy proves false to me And she cut short the conversation by going out for a walk Perry Toat immediately resolved in some way to prove to the girl that Eddy Vail was falseness itself But I wonder what she knows the detective asked herself as she went in search of Parizade The blind girl was in her bedroom lying down as the heat of the day and the hard work in the shop had tried her delicate constitution somewhat severely The moment she heard Miss Toat s step she called her by name How did you know it was me asked the newcomer taking a seat beside the bed Parizade laughed Oh I can tell your footsteps she admitted that is one way and the other is by that scent you use Miss Toat sniffed her handkerchief Peruvian Fragrance she said with a laugh yes it is an uncommon scent George brings it to me he s a purser on a steamer you know Parizade in her darkness groped for the detective s hand Yes dear I know and it is because you are in love as I am that I like you so much I don t mind your being a detective at all but I do hope you ll marry soon and give up the horrid business There s no chance of my marrying George until I get this thousand pounds reward which Sir Joseph Branwin offers And I am to get half of it if I can help you remember said the blind girl Like yourself I can t marry Walter until we have money Then we can live in the country in a tiny cottage and he can paint his pictures while I look after the household But can you do that Parizade seeing you are blind Oh I have eyes at the end of my fingers said the other caressingly Why I know every bit of this large house so it will not be difficult to learn all about a small cottage But fancy Walter loving a blind girl like me You are so pretty Parizade I am glad of that and it s all really genuine Oh Parizade fell back on her pillows with a sigh how glad I shall be to take my own name and leave this horrid Pink Shop Has what I told you given you any help I do so want my share of the reward I have got no help from it so far said Miss Toat shaking her head Tell me again exactly what happened Oh I have told you over and over again said Parizade petulantly There was another person in the house on that night I know Rosy Pearl said the detective swiftly Yes she was the customer who slept in the upstairs bedroom and who did not wish her name to be known Inspector Lanton was told by Madame but as Miss Pearl knew nothing she was not called as a witness at her own request But how did you learn the name Miss Toat Madame warned the girls not to tell it to anyone I learnt it indirectly from Madame herself said Miss Toat evasively I suppose she was the person you heard breathing in the passage No said Parizade decisively I am sure that person was a man Why do you think so Because the breathing was so heavy and there was that smell of Harris tweed you can t mistake that smell and only men wear Harris tweed Yes and no Ladies sometimes have dresses made of it But describe exactly how you came to hear and smell this person Oh Parizade yawned I have told you so often Tell me again Every time you tell me I get a fresh idea Well said the blind girl lying back passively on the night of the murder of course we none of us knew anything about it until next morning Madame and the girls went to bed just after nine o clock as we were all so tired Madame after she saw Miss Branwin at the door to say that her mother would remain for treatment sent away her husband and retired It was just after nine when I remembered that I left a present from Walter to me in the shop I didn t want the other girls to see it so I went down about half past nine In the darkness of course said the listening detective Yes Darkness and light are the same to me I know the house so well that I never stumble or miss my way Well I found the present a pair of gloves just where Peri Banou had been lying in the alcove I believe she must have seen them Then in returning along the lower passage I heard the sound of heavy breathing at the end near the door which leads into the court That was locked It always is but it might have been open for all I know on that night I knew someone was there and guessed that it was a man as I smelt the peculiar scent of Harris tweed so strongly I fancied that Eddy Vail had not gone away but had come back You mean that he had remained in the house corrected Perry Toat Oh yes At all events I fancied it was Eddy so not wishing to get myself into trouble with Madame as she might have asked him to stay I went upstairs and said nothing Next day I learnt about the murder and both Madame and Eddy said that he had really left the house Then I became certain that there had been a stranger in the passage Rosy Pearl perhaps No She was sleeping upstairs But you may guess that I said nothing to anyone about what I had heard and smelt Why did you not It might have given Inspector Lanton a clue Parizade shuddered Oh I didn t want to be mixed up with the police It was best I thought to hold my tongue I never told anyone until you came and said you were a detective Well and why did you tell me You were frightened when I told you my profession if I remember rightly Yes But somehow your being a woman made it seem better I don t mind a lady detective Then when you told about the reward I thought I might help you and get half so that I might marry Walter You shall get it if I am successful said Miss Toat emphatically But do you really think that there was a man in the passage on that night Yes I do near the house door that leads into the court He escaped in that way and I believe he murdered Lady Branwin I could swear to it It will be hard to trace the criminal male or female by the smell of Harris tweed
