One fine afternoon after a march of twenty two miles over a rocky road and finding our provisions low Mr Bailey and Jack went out to shoot wild turkeys As they shouldered their guns and walked away Captain Ogilby called out to them Do not go too far from camp Jack returned at sundown with a pair of fine turkeys but Bailey failed to come in However as they all knew him to be an experienced woodsman no one showed much anxiety until darkness had settled over the camp Then they began to signal by discharging their rifles the officers went out in various directions giving halloos and firing at intervals but there came no sound of the missing man The camp was now thoroughly alarmed This was too dangerous a place for a man to be wandering around in all night and search parties of soldiers were formed Trees were burned and the din of rifles constantly discharged added to the excitement One party after another came in They had scoured the country and not a trace of Bailey The young wife sat in her tent soothing her little child everybody except her gave up hope the time dragged on our hearts grew heavy the sky was alight with blazing trees I went into Mrs Bailey s tent She was calm and altogether lovely and said Charley can t get lost and unless something has happened to him he will come in Ella Bailey was a brave young army woman she was an inspiration to the entire camp Finally after hours of the keenest anxiety a noise of gladsome shouts rang through the trees and in came a party of men with the young officer on their shoulders His friend Craig had been untiring in the search and at last had heard a faint halloo in the distance and one shot the only cartridge poor Bailey had left After going over almost impassable places they finally found him lying at the bottom of a ravine In the black darkness of the evening he had walked directly over the edge of the chasm and fallen to the bottom dislocating his ankle He was some miles from camp and had used up all his ammunition except the one cartridge He had tried in vain to walk or even crawl out of the ravine but had finally been overcome by exhaustion and lay there helpless in the wild vastnesses of the mountains A desperate situation indeed Some time afterwards he told me how he felt when he realized how poor his chances were when he saw he had only one cartridge left and found that he had scarce strength to answer a halloo should he hear one But soldiers never like to talk much about such things din n The bustle and din gradually faded to silence as night advanced They tried to make themselves heard over the din of the crowd jack n v n Jake I am looking for the headphone jack He lifted the car with a jack to change the flat tyre intervals n [ ] interval [ ] The forecast said there would be sunny intervals and showers Meetings take place at fortnightly intervals thoroughly adv The soil must be thoroughly turned over before planting The soldiers have been thoroughly instructed in the care of their weapons scoured scour We scoured the area for somewhere to pitch our tent The torrents scoured out a channel down the hill side soothing adj Put on some nice soothing music His casual relaxed manner was very soothing cartridge n Unfortunately the G cartridge design is very difficult to set accurately G This rifle only holds one cartridge chasm n There s a chasm between rich and poor in that society A huge chasm gaped before them ammunition n A few of the jeeps had run out of ammunition They have expended all their ammunition exhaustion n She slept the sleep of exhaustion His exhaustion was obvious when he fell asleep standing
