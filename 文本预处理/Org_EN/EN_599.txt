The winter the real winter extended itself by degrees over the Basque land after the few days of frost that had come to annihilate the annual plants to change the deceptive aspect of the fields to prepare the following spring And Ramuntcho acquired slowly his habits of one left alone in his house wherein he lived still without anybody to serve him he took care of himself as in the colonies or in the barracks knowing the thousand little details of housekeeping which careful soldiers practice He preserved the pride of dress dressed himself well wore the ribbon of the brave at his buttonhole and a wide crape around his sleeve At first he was not assiduous at the village cider mill where the men assembled in the cold evenings In his three years of travel of reading of talking with different people too many new ideas had penetrated his already open mind among his former companions he felt more outcast than before more detached from the thousand little things which composed their life Little by little however by dint of being alone by dint of passing by the halls where the men drank on the window panes of which a lamp always sketches the shadows of Basque caps he had made it a custom to go in and to sit at a table It was the season when the Pyrenean villages freed from the visitors which the summers bring imprisoned by the clouds the mist or the snow are more intensely as they were in ancient times In these cider mills sole little illuminated points living in the midst of the immense empty darkness of the fields something of the spirit of former times is reanimated in winter evenings In front of the large casks of cider arranged in lines in the background where it is dark the lamp hanging from the beams throws its light on the images of saints that decorate the walls on the groups of mountaineers who talk and who smoke At times someone sings a plaintive song which came from the night of centuries the beating of a tambourine recalls to life old forgotten rhythms a guitar reawakens a sadness of the epoch of the Moors Or in the face of each other two men with castanets in their hands suddenly dance the fandango swinging themselves with an antique grace And from these innocent little inns they retire early especially in these bad rainy nights the darkness of which is so peculiarly propitious to smuggling every one here having to do some clandestine thing on the Spanish side In such places in the company of Arrochkoa Ramuntcho talked over and commented upon his cherished sacrilegious project or during the beautiful moon light nights which do not permit of undertakings on the frontier they talked on the roads for a long time Persistent religions scruples made him hesitate a great deal although he hardly realized it They were inexplicable scruples since he had ceased to be a believer But all his will all his audacity all his life were concentrated and directed more and more toward this unique end And the prohibition ordered by Itchoua from seeing Gracieuse before the great attempt exasperated his impatient dream The winter capricious as it is always in this country pursued its unequal march with from time to time surprises of sunlight and of heat There were rains of a deluge grand healthy squalls which went up from the Bay of Biscay plunged into the valleys bending the trees furiously And then repetitions of the wind of the south breaths as warm as in summer breezes smelling of Africa under a sky at once high and sombre among mountains of an intense brown color And also glacial mornings wherein one saw at awakening summits become snowy and white The desire often seized him to finish everything But he had the frightful idea that he might not succeed and might fall again alone forever without a hope in life Anyway reasonable pretexts to wait were not lacking He had to settle with men of affairs he had to sell the house and realize for his flight all the money that he could obtain He had also to wait for the answer of Uncle Ignacio to whom he had announced his emigration and at whose house he expected to find an asylum Thus the days went by and soon the hasty spring was to ferment Already the yellow primrose and the blue gentian in advance here by several weeks were in bloom in the woods and along the paths in the last suns of January annihilate v Archer crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the
