Ramuntcho that evening had come to the meeting place earlier than usual with more hesitation also in his walk for one risks on these June evenings to find girls belated along the paths or boys behind the hedges on love expeditions And by chance she was already alone looking outside without waiting for him however At once she noticed his agitated demeanor and guessed that something new had happened Not daring to come too near he made a sign to her to come quickly jump over the window sill and meet him in the obscure alley where they talked without fear Then as soon as she was near him in the nocturnal shade of the trees he put his arm around her waist and announced to her brusquely the great piece of news which since the morning troubled his young head and that of Franchita his mother Uncle Ignacio has written True Uncle Ignacio She knew that that adventurous uncle that American uncle who had disappeared for so many years had never thought until now of sending more than a strange good day by a passing sailor Yes And he says that he has property there which requires attention large prairies herds of horses that he has no children that if I wish to go and live near him with a gentle Basque girl married to me here he would be glad to adopt both of us Oh I think mother will come also So if you wish We could marry now You know they marry people as young as we it is allowed Now that I am to be adopted by my uncle and I shall have a real situation in life your mother will consent I think And as for military service we shall not care for that shall we They sat on the mossy rocks their heads somewhat dizzy troubled by the approach and the unforeseen temptation of happiness So it would not be in an uncertain future after his term as a soldier it would be almost at once in two months in one month perhaps that communion of their minds and of their flesh so ardently desired and now so forbidden might be accomplished without sin honestly in the eyes of all permitted and blessed Oh they had never looked at this so closely And they pressed against each other their foreheads made heavy by too many thoughts fatigued suddenly by a sort of too delicious delirium Around them the odor of the flowers of June ascended from the earth filling the night with an immense suavity And as if there were not enough scattered fragrance the jessamine the honeysuckle on the walls exhaled from moment to moment in intermittent puffs the excess of their perfume one would have thought that hands swung in silence censers in the darkness for some hidden festival for some enchantment magnificent and secret There are often and everywhere very mysterious enchantments like this emanating from nature itself commanded by one knows not what sovereign will with unfathomable designs to deceive us all on the road to death You do not reply Gracieuse you say nothing to me He could see that she was intoxicated also like him and yet he divined by her manner of remaining mute so long that shadows were amassing over his charming and beautiful dream But she asked at last your naturalization papers You have received them have you not Yes they arrived last week you know very well and it was you who said that I should apply for them Then you are a Frenchman to day Then if you do not do your military service you are a deserter Yes A deserter no but refractory I think it is called It isn t better since one cannot come back I was not thinking of that How she was tortured now to have caused this thought to have impelled him herself to this act which made soar over his hardly seen joy a threat so black Oh a deserter he her Ramuntcho That is banished forever from the dear Basque country And this departure for America becomes suddenly frightfully grave solemn similar to a death since he could not possibly return Then what was there to be done Now they were anxious and mute each one preferring to submit to the will of the other and waiting with equal fright for the decision which should be taken to go or to remain From the depths of their two young hearts ascended little by little a similar distress poisoning the happiness offered over there in that America from which they would never return And the little nocturnal censers of jessamine of honeysuckle of linden continued to throw into the air exquisite puffs to intoxicate them the darkness that enveloped them seemed more and more caressing and soft in the silence of the village and of the country the tree toads gave from moment to moment their little flute note which seemed a very discreet love call under the velvet of the moss and through the black lace of the foliage in the serenity of a June sky which one thought forever unalterable they saw scintillate like a simple and gentle dust of phosphorus the terrifying multitude of the worlds The curfew began to ring however at the church The sound of that bell at night especially was for them something unique on earth At this moment it was something like a voice bringing in their indecision its advice its counsel decisive and tender Mute still they listened to it with an increasing emotion of an intensity till then unknown the brown head of the one leaning on the brown head of the other It said the advising voice the dear protecting voice No do not go forever the far off lands are made for the time of youth but you must be able to return to Etchezar it is here that you must grow old and die nowhere in the world could you sleep as in this graveyard around the church where one may even when lying under the earth hear me ring again They yielded more and more to the voice of the bell the two children whose minds were religious and primitive And Ramuntcho felt on his cheek a tear of Gracieuse No he said at last I will not desert I think that I would not have the courage to do it I thought the same thing as you my Ramuntcho she said No let us not do that I was waiting for you to say it Then he realized that he also was crying like her The die was cast they would permit to pass by happiness which was within their reach almost under their hands they would postpone everything to a future uncertain and so far off And now in the sadness in the meditation of the great decision which they had taken they communicated to each other what seemed best for them to do We might she said write a pretty letter to your uncle Ignacio write to him that you accept that you will come with a great deal of pleasure immediately after your military service you might even add if you wish that the one who is engaged to you thanks him and will be ready to follow you but that decidedly you cannot desert And why should you not talk to your mother now Gatchutcha only to know what she would think Because now you understand I am not as I was an abandoned child Slight steps behind them in the path and above the wall the silhouette of a young man who had come on the tips of his sandals as if to spy upon them Go escape my Ramuntcho we will meet to morrow evening In half a second there was nobody he was hidden in a bush she had fled into her room Ended was their grave interview Ended until when Until to morrow or until always On
