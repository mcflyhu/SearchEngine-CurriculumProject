The man Vyvian came He came again and again but not to dinner Perhaps he suspected about the potatoes and thought that they would not even be compensated for by the pleasure of sneering at the boarders He came in the evenings and sat in the sitting room and drank coffee the only thing that was well cooked in Peggy s household and talked to Hilary and looked at Rhoda Rhoda embroidering apple boughs on a green dress front shivered and trembled under his eyes Now I know thought Peter seeing Vyvian look what villains in books are really like Vyvian is just like one specially about the eyes He was sitting near Rhoda playing that sort of patience called calcul distinguished from other patiences by the fact that it comes out that was why Peter liked it He had refused to night to join in the game the others were playing which was animal grab though usually he enjoyed it very much Peter liked games though he seldom won them But this evening he played patience by himself and sat by Rhoda and consulted her at crucial moments and babbled of many things and knew whenever Vyvian looked and Rhoda shook At half past nine Vyvian stopped talking to Hilary and crossed the room and took the arm chair on Rhoda s other side Enthralling evenings you spend here he remarked including in his glance Rhoda s embroidery Peter s patience and the animal grab table from which cheerfully matter of fact farmyard and jungle cries proceeded with spirit Rhoda said nothing Her head was bent over her work The next moment she pricked her finger violently and started Before she could get her handkerchief out Vyvian had his and was enveloping her small hand in it Too bad he said in a voice so low that the farmyard cries drowned it as far as Peter was concerned Poor little finger He held it and the handkerchief closely in his two hands Rhoda her colour flooding and ebbing over her thin face and thin neck down to the insertion yoke of her evening blouse trembled like a captured bird Her eyes fell from his look a bold bad look Peter thought finding literary terminology appropriate The next moment the little table on which Peter was playing toppled over onto the floor with a small crash and all his cards were scattered on the carpet Rhoda started and looked round pulling her hand away as if a spell was broken Dear me said Peter regretfully it was just on coming out too I shan t try again to night it s not my night obviously He was picking up the cards Rhoda watched him silently Do you know calcul Mr Vyvian Peter enquired collecting scattered portions of the pack from under the arm chair Mr Vyvian stared at Peter s back which was the part of him most visible at the moment I really can t say I have the pleasure no That Peter felt certain was an insolent drawl Would you like to learn it said Peter politely Are you fond of patience I can t say I am said Mr Vyvian Oh Then you would like calcul People who are really fond of other patiences don t they despise it because it comes out I don t like any other sort of patience I m not clever enough so I like this Let me teach you may I Vyvian got up Thanks you re quite too kind On the whole I think I can conduct my life without any form of patience even one which comes out You have a turn then Miss Johnson said Peter arranging the cards Perhaps it ll come out for you though it won t for me to night Since you are all so profitably occupied said Vyvian I think I will say good night Peter said Oh must you Good night then We play calcul most nights so you can learn it some other time if you d like to A delightful prospect Vyvian murmured his glance again comprehensively wandering round the room A happy family party you seem here Good night He bent over Rhoda with his ironic politeness I was going to ask you if you would come out with me to morrow evening to a theatre But since your evenings seem to be so pleasantly filled otherwise She looked up at him a moment wavered met his dark eyes was caught by the old domination and swept off her feet as of old Oh I should like to come She was a little breathless Good I will call for you then at seven and we will dine together Au revoir He swept her a mocking bow and was gone Peter murmured to himself Then he looked at Rhoda and found her eyes upon his face wide frightened bewildered and knew in a flash that she had never meant to consent to go out with Vyvian that she had been caught by the old power he had over her and swept off her feet That knowledge gave him confidence and he could say You don t want to go do you Let me go after him and tell him Oh she pressed her hands together in front of her But I must go I said I would Peter was on his feet and out of the door in a second He saw Vyvian in the passage downstairs putting on his coat He spoke from half way down the stairs Oh Miss Johnson asks me to say she is sorry she can t go with you to morrow night after all she finds she has another engagement Vyvian turned and looked up at him a slight smile lifting his lip Really was all he said All the same I think I will call at seven and try to persuade her to change her mind again Good night As plainly as possible he had said to Peter I believe you to be lying Peter had no particular objection to his believing that he was not proud but he did object to his calling at seven and trying to persuade Rhoda to change her mind again for he believed that that would be a task easy of achievement He went back into the sitting room Rhoda was sitting still her hands twisted together on the green serge on her lap Peter sat down by her and said Will you come out with me instead to morrow evening and she looked at him her teeth clenched over her lower lip as if to steady it and said after a moment forlornly If you like It was so much less exciting than going with Vyvian would have been that Peter felt compunction You shall choose the play he said Peter Pan do you think Or something funny The Sins of Society or something Rhoda whispered Anything nearly on the edge of tears A vividness had flashed again into her grey life and she was trying to quench it She had heroically though as an afterthought flung an extinguishing douche of water at it but now that she had done so she was melting into unheroic self pity I want to go to bed she said shakily and did so feeling for her pocket handkerchief as she crossed the room At a quarter to seven the next evening Peter looked for Rhoda thinking it well that they should be out of the house by seven o clock but couldn t find her till Miss Clegson said she had met her going into church as she herself came out Peter went to the church to find her Rhoda didn t as a rule frequent churches not believing in the creeds they taught but even to the unbelieving a church is often a refuge Peter coming into the great dim place out of the wet fog found it again as he had long since known it to be a refuge from fogs and other ills of living Far up the seven lamps that never go out burned dimly through the blurred air It was a gaudy place no doubt over decorated a church for the poor who love gaudiness Perhaps Peter too loved gaudiness Anyhow he loved this place and its seven lamps and its shrines and statued saints Surely whatever one believed of the mysterious world and of all the other mysterious worlds that might be floating behind the veils surely here was a very present help in trouble a luminous brightness shining in a fog choked world Peter sitting by the door sank into a great peace Half way up the church he saw Rhoda sitting very still She too was looking up the church towards the lamps and the altar beyond them Presently a cassocked sacristan came and lit the vesper lights for evensong was to be at seven and the altar blazed out an unearthly brilliance in the dim place The low murmur of voices a patient priest had been hearing confessions for an hour ceased and people began coming in one by one for service Rhoda shivered a little and got up and came down the church Peter joined her at the door and they passed shivering into the fog together I was looking for you said Peter when they were out in the alley that led to the church door It s time we went isn t it she said apathetically Then she added inconsequently The church seems the only place where one can find a bit of peace I can t think why when probably it s all a fairy tale I suppose that s why said Peter Fairyland is the most peaceful country there is You can t get peace out of what s not true Rhoda insisted querulously Oh I don t know Besides fairy tales aren t necessarily untrue do you think I don t mean that when I call what churches teach a fairy tale I mean it s beautiful and romantic and full of light and colour and wonderful things happening And it s probably the truer for that D you believe it all queried Rhoda but he couldn t answer her as to that I don t know I never do know exactly what I believe I can t think how anyone does But yes I think I like to believe in those things they re too beautiful not to be true It s the ugly things that are true she said coughing in the fog Why yes the ugly things and the beautiful God and the devil if one puts it like that Oh yes I believe very much in the devil I can t believe that any street of houses could look quite like this without the help of someone utterly given over to evil thinking We aren t you see none of us are ugly enough in our minds to have thought out some of the things one sees so there must be a devil Rhoda was silent He thought she was crying He said gently I say would you like to come out to night or would you rather be quiet at home It would be safe to return home by half past seven he thought She said in a small muffled voice that she didn t care A tall figure passed by them in the narrow alley looming through the fog Rhoda started and shrank back against the brick wall clutching Peter s arm The next moment the figure passed into the circle of light thrown down by a high lamp that glimmered over a Robbia esque plaque shrine let into the wall and they saw that it was a cassocked priest from the clergy house going into church Rhoda let out her breath faintly in a sigh and her fingers fell from Peter s coat sleeve Oh she whispered I m frightened Let s stay close to the church just outside the door where we can see the light and hear the music I don t want to go out into the streets to night Peter I want to stay here I m so frightened Come inside suggested Peter as they turned back to the church It would be warmer But she shook her head No I d rather be outside I don t belong in there Peter said Why not and she told him Because for me it s the ugly things that are true So together they stood in the porch outside the great oak door and heard the sound of singing stealing out fog softened and smelt the smell of incense it was the festal service of some saint that pierced the thick air with its pungent sweetness They sat down on the seat in the porch and Rhoda shivered not with cold and Peter waited by her very patiently knowing that she needed him as she had never needed him before She told him so You don t mind staying Peter I feel safer with you than with anyone else You see I m afraid Oh I can t tell you how it is I feel When he looks at me it s as if he was drawing me and dragging me and I feel I must get up and follow him wherever he goes It s always been like that since first I met him more than a year ago He made me care he made me worship the ground he walked on if he d thrown me down and kicked me I d have let him But he never cared himself I know that now I ve known it a long time And I ve vowed to myself and I vowed to mother when she lay dying that I wouldn t let him have anything more to do with me He frightens me because he can twist me round his finger and make me care so and it hurts And he s just playing he ll never really care But for all I know that I know he can get me whenever he wants me And he s come back again to amuse himself seeing me worship him and he ll make me follow him about and all the time he ll be thinking me a little fool and I shall know it but I can t help it Peter I can t help it I ve nothing to hold on to to save me If I could be religious if I could pray like the people in there but he says there s nothing in that he s made me believe like him and I sometimes think he only believes in himself and that s why I can only believe in him too So I ve got nothing in the world to hold on to and I shall be carried away and drowned She was crying with strangled sobbings her face in her thin hands Peter s arm was put gently about her shoulders comforting her No you won t Rhoda Rhoda dear you won t be carried away because I shall be here holding you Is that any help at all He felt her relax beneath his arm and lean back against him he heard her whisper Yes oh yes If I can hold onto you Peter I shall feel safe Hold on then said Peter as tight as you like She looked up at him with wet eyes and he felt the claim and the appeal of her piercing straight into his heart I could care she whispered Are you sure Peter His arm tightened about her He hadn t meant precisely what she had understood him to mean at least he hadn t translated his purpose to help her to the uttermost into a specified relation as she was doing but if the purpose to be fulfilled had to be so translated he was ready for that too So he said Quite sure Rhoda I want to be the most to you that you ll let me be and her face was hidden against his coat and her tension relaxed utterly and she murmured Oh I can be safe like that So they sat in silence together between the lit sanctuary and the desolate night and heard as from a long way off the sound of chanting Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word For mine eyes have seen Later on Rhoda said quiet and happy now I ve thought you cared Peter for some time And last night when I saw you hated Guy to be near me I felt sure But I feel I ve so little to give you So much of me is burnt away and spoilt But it ll come back Peter I think if you love me I do love you very much you ve been such a dear to me always from the very first night at the Palazzo when you spoke to me and smiled Only I couldn t think of anyone but Guy then But lately I ve been thinking Peter s worth a hundred Guys and if only I could care for him I should feel safe And I do care ever so much and if it s a different sort of caring from what I ve felt for Guy it s a better sort That s a bad black sort that hurts I never want any more of that Caring for you will keep me from that Peter It s dear of you to care for me at all said Peter And we won t let Guy come near us now or ever You hate him don t you said Rhoda I know you do Oh well I don t know that it s as bad as all that He s more funny than anything else it seems to me He might have walked straight out of a novel he does all the things they do in books you know and that one never thinks people really do outside them He sneers insolently I watch him sometimes to see how it s done He curls his upper lip too when he s feeling contemptuous that s another nice trick that I should like to acquire Oh he s quite an interesting study really You ve taken him wrong you know You ve taken him seriously He s not meant for that Oh said Rhoda vaguely uncomprehending You are a funny boy Peter You do talk so I never know if you mean half you say About two thirds I think said Peter The rest is lies We all lie in my family and not well either because we re rather weak in the intellect Now do you feel like supper because I do Let s come home and have it shall we They went home through the fog Rhoda clinging to Peter s arm as to an anchor in a sweeping sea A great peace and security possessed her she no longer started at the tall figures that loomed by They let themselves into Brook Street and blinked at one another in the lamp lit linoleumed little hall Rhoda looked at herself in the glass and said What a fright I am seeing her tear stained countenance and straggling fog wet locks The dinner bell rang and she ran upstairs to tidy herself Peter and she came into the dining room together during the soup Let s tell them at once Peter whispered Rhoda so Peter obediently said as he sat down by Peggy Rhoda and I have just settled to marry Marry Hilary queried from the end of the table Marry whom And Rhoda blushing laughed for the first time for some days Peggy said Don t be silly Hilary Each other of course the darlings mean Well well and to think I never guessed that all this time Oh said Miss Clegson I did Mrs Margerison I had a very shrewd suspicion I assure you And this evening when Mr Peter asked me where Miss Johnson was gone and I told him into church and he followed her straight away I said to myself Well that looks like something we all know about very well I didn t say it to anyone else I wouldn t breathe a word till all was settled I knew you asked me in confidence Mr Peter but I thought the more I was always one to see things they used to tell me I could see through a stone wall Well I m sure I offer my congratulations to both of you And I too with all my heart said Miss Matthews the lady who did not attend ritualistic churches Do I understand that the happy arrangement was made in church Miss Johnson I gather from Miss Clegson that Mr Peter followed you there Oh not inside Miss Matthews said Rhoda blushing again and looking rather pretty In the porch we were Miss Matthews sniffed faintly Such goings on might she conveyed be expected in the porch of St Austin s with all that incense coming through the door and all that confessing going on inside Well said Mr Bridger we ought to have some champagne to drink success to the happy event Short of that let us fill the festive bumpers with the flowing lemonade Pass the jug down Here s to you Miss Rhoda here s to you Mr Peter Margerison May you both be as happy as you deserve No one will want me to wish you anything better than that I m sure Here s luck you dears said Peggy drinking Engagements in general delighted her and Peter s in particular And poor little Rhoda was looking so bright and happy at last Peggy wouldn t have taken it upon herself to call it a remarkably suitable alliance had she been asked but then she hadn t been asked and Peter was such a sweet natured loving lovable dear that he would get on with anyone and Rhoda though sometimes a silly and sometimes fractious was a dear little girl too The two facts that would have occurred to some sisters in law that they had extremely few pennies between them and that Rhoda wasn t precisely of Peter s gentle extraction didn t bother Peggy at all They occurred however to Hilary It occurred to him that Peter would now require all his slender earnings for himself and wife which was awkward also that Peter really needn t have looked down to the lower middle classes for a wife Hilary believed in gentle birth through all his vicissitudes a pathetic pride of breeding clung to him One might be down at heels one might be reduced to sordid means of livelihood even to shady schemes for enlarging one s income but once a gentleman always so and one was not to be ranked with the bounders the Vyvians the wealthy Leslies even Hilary looked resigned and weary Why should Peter want to marry a commonplace and penniless little nobody and not so very pretty either though she looked nice and bright when she was animated as now Well he said when is it to be Peter looked across at Rhoda I should hope very soon he said It was obviously safer and safety was the object to have it very soon How soon can one get married There have to be banns and so on don t there The third time of asking that brings it to the eighteenth of December What about the nineteenth Rhoda That s a Monday Really Peter Rhoda blushed more than ever That seems awfully soon Well said Peter blind to the unusualness of such a discussion at the dinner table the sooner the better don t you think There s nothing to wait for I don t suppose we shall ever have more money to do it on than we have now I know of a man who waited years and years because he thought he hadn t got quite enough and he got a little more each year and at the end of six years he thought to double his fortune by putting it all on a winner because he was getting so impatient And the horse came in last So the girl broke it off and married someone else and the man s heart broke and he took to drink Well enquired Miss Matthews who thought Peter habitually irrelevant in his remarks Well so let s be married on December the nineteenth I m sure said Rhoda we re quite embarrassing everybody being so public Let s settle it afterwards Peter when we re alone But she too meant to have it as soon as might be after the third time of asking it was safer much safer so Well said Miss Clegson as the ladies rose from the table now we re going to carry Miss Johnson away to tell us all about it and we ll leave Mr Peter to tell you gentlemen his secrets And after that we ll have a good round game but two of the present company can be left out if they like better to sit in the window seat But when the other gentlemen repaired to the drawing room for the good round game Peter stayed behind with Hilary He didn t want to talk or be talked to only to stay where he was and not to have to sit in the window seat The insufferable vulgarity of this class of person on this subject is really the limit Hilary remarked plaintively as if it had jarred him beyond endurance They re awfully kind aren t they said Peter who looked tired Then he laughed to himself Hilary looked at him enquiringly I suppose you know your own business Peter But I must confess I am surprised I had literally no idea you had such a step in mind I hadn t any idea either Peter admitted frankly I thought of it quite suddenly But I think it is a good plan you know Of course he added wording what he read in Hilary s face I know my life will cost me more But I think it is worth while It s quite entirely your own business Hilary said again throwing responsibility from him with a gesture of the hands Then he leant back and shut his eyes Peter looked at him as he lay in the arm chair and smoked his eyes rested on the jaded still beautiful face the dark lock of hair falling a little over the tired forehead the brown velvet smoking coat and large red silk tie He knew that he had hurt and puzzled Hilary And he knew that Hilary wouldn t understand if he were to explain what he couldn t ever explain At the most he would say It is Peter all over and shrug his shoulders at Peter and Peter s vagaries A great desire to smooth Hilary s difficult road as far as might be caught and held Peter Poor old Hilary He was so frightfully tired of life and its struggles tired of being a Have Not To help the other Have Nots to put pleasant things into their hands as far as might be seemed to Peter at this moment the thing for which one existed It is obviously the business of the Have Nots to do that for one another for the Haves do not know or understand It is the Have Nots who must give and give and give with emptying hands for from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath Peter went upstairs to the drawing room to play animal
