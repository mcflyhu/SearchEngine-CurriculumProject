The bell of Etchezar the same dear old bell that of the tranquil curfew that of the festivals and that of the agonies rang joyously in the beautiful sun of June The village was decorated with white cloths white embroideries and the procession of the Fete Dieu passed slowly on a green strewing of fennel seed and of reeds cut from the marshes The mountains seemed near and sombre somewhat ferocious in their brown tones above this white parade of little girls marching on a carpet of cut leaves and grass All the old banners of the church were there illuminated by that sun which they had known for centuries but which they see only once or twice a year on the consecrated days The large one that of the Virgin in white silk embroidered with pale gold was borne by Gracieuse who walked in white dress her eyes lost in a mystic dream Behind the young girls came the women all the women of the village wearing black veils including Dolores and Franchita the two enemies Men numerous enough closed this cortege tapers in their hands heads uncovered but there were especially gray hairs faces with expressions vanquished and resigned heads of old men Gracieuse holding high the banner of the Virgin became at this hour one of the Illuminati she felt as if she were marching as after death toward the celestial tabernacles And when at instants the reminiscence of Ramuntcho s lips traversed her dream she had the impression in the midst of all this white of a sharp stain delicious still Truly as her thoughts became more elevated from day to day what brought her back to him was less her senses capable in her of being tamed than true profound tenderness the one which resists time and deceptions of the flesh And this tenderness was augmented by the fact that Ramuntcho was less fortunate than she and more abandoned in life having had no father tranquil adj The boy disturbed the tranquil surface of the pond with a stick The tranquil beauty of the village scenery is unique joyously ad She opened the door for me and threw herself in my arms screaming joyously and demanding that we decorate the tree immediately They came running crying out joyously in trilling girlish voices embroideries embroidery Some of the embroideries are in bold bright colours others are quietly elegant These embroideries permitted Annabel and Midge to play their game in the luxury of peaceful consciences strewing v strew What a mess Look at the pajamas strewing on the bed marshes n marsh Cows were grazing on the marshes We had to cross the marshes ferocious adj The ferocious winds seemed about to tear the ship to pieces The ferocious panther is chasing a rabbit illuminated adj Floodlights illuminated the stadium the illuminated city at night consecrated adj v consecrate The church was consecrated in They consecrated a temple to their god virgin n adj Have you ever been to a virgin forest There are vast expanses of virgin land in the remote regions embroidered adj She embroidered flowers on the cushion covers She embroidered flowers on the front of the dress tapers taper The pencil tapers to a sharp point She put five tapers on the cake vanquished v vanquish She had fought many battles vanquished many foes I vanquished her coldness with my assiduity celestial adj The rosy light yet beamed like a celestial dawn Gravity governs the motions of celestial bodies deceptions deception Nobody saw through Mary s deceptions There was for him only one trustworthy road through deceptions and mirages
