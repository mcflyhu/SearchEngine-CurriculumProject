There was a terrible hubbub in the henhouse The Rooster squalled so loudly that he waked up every hen in the place And when they heard him crying that a skunk had knocked him off his roost they were as frightened as he was and set up a wild cackle All but Henrietta Hen She knew there was no skunk there Don t be a goose er don t be a gander she hissed to the Rooster I m the one that bumped into you The Rooster quickly came to his senses Don t be alarmed ladies he called to the flock There s no danger There s been a slight mistake He pretended that he hadn t been scared But he had been And now he was somewhat uneasy about Henrietta Hen He feared he was in for a scolding from her If you had answered me when I spoke to you I wouldn t have left my perch in the dark she told the Rooster severely When I moved to your perch to see what was the matter I blundered into you And then you thought I was a skunk You owe me an apology sir The Rooster was glad it was not lighter in the henhouse for he felt himself flushing hotly You must pardon me he said I had no idea it was you for you waked me out of a sound sleep Sound sleep indeed Henrietta Hen exclaimed with a sniff Why you had been crowing only a few moments before In fact it was your crowing that roused me No doubt said the Rooster But you see I fell asleep again immediately Then you must be ill Henrietta retorted for I ve never known you to go to sleep again once you ve begun your morning s crowing But it s not morning now the Rooster informed her It s not even late at night certainly not an hour since sunset Henrietta Hen was astonished I noticed that the night seemed short she muttered The Rooster thought it a great joke Ha ha he laughed And he said to the rest of the flock with a chuckle Henrietta thought it was morning No doubt she d have gone out into the yard if the door hadn t been shut And the other hens all tittered They always did if the rooster expected them to Well if there was one thing that Henrietta Hen couldn t endure it was to be laughed at Don t be silly she cried Why shouldn t I think it was morning when he crowed almost in my ear Don t you know why I crowed the Rooster asked her And without waiting for any reply he said I crowed to let Farmer Green know it was going to rain to morrow Of course Henrietta Hen had to have the last word The Rooster might have known she would Then she observed I suppose you squawked to let him know there was a skunk in the henhouse hubbub n The hubbub of voices drowned out the host s voice He concentrated on the work in hand and the hubbub outside the room simply flowed over him skunk n v That was a rotten thing to do you skunk The skunk gives off an unpleasant smell when attacked hissed hiss Have you ever been hissed at in the middle of a speech The iron hissed as it pressed the wet cloth spoke n v speak They sourced the spoke nuts from our company The spokes of a wheel are the bars that connect the outer ring to the centre perch n v The bird took its perch Little birds perch themselves on the branches severely adv He was severely criticized and removed from his post He is severely put down for his careless work lighter n v light The portrait was touched up so as to make it lighter The lighter works off the car battery sniff vi The police used dogs to sniff out the criminals in their hiding place When Munchie meets a dog on the beach they sniff each other for a while chuckle vi n He shook his head with a soft chuckle I couldn t suppress a soft chuckle at the thought of it
