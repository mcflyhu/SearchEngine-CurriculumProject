We ll have to sell the store said Bob Harman with decision No use blinking it What sell Harman s cried his sister Alice aghast Well why not Bob demanded It s bringing nothing in It hasn t been paying expenses for ever so long We d all be richer if it had been sold years ago Very likely muttered Carl But fancy Harman s going out of the family All three turned and looked at the weatherbeaten side of the frame building adjoining the house the store that for half a century had been known as Harman s It had been a great place in its day had Harman s Almost the first recollections of all three children were connected with the store They had played behind the counters been weighed on the big scales and the familiar rich smell of molasses and tea and hardware and cloth was like an odor of home Later they had helped to serve customers it did not keep them very busy and for the last year Carl had managed the business almost single handed It did seem impossible to give up the store The three orphans were holding a council on the front veranda of the old brick house where the Harmans had lived ever since they came as pioneers into Upper Canada Once there had been three hundred acres of land and capacious barns and stables and stock but all this had dwindled away till the farm was represented by ten acres behind the house and even this was rented to a neighbor The April sunshine was warm on the veranda although the fields were still brown and patches of snow lay here and there in sheltered nooks The maples at the roadside were red and in Alice s garden green sprouts were bravely pushing up On the south side of the fence were the twelve white painted hives of her bees and the hum of flying insects filled the air Nearly eighty years before the Harmans had been among the first pioneers who broke into the wilderness north of Lake Ontario They had helped to open the roads they had cleared land and they had started a frontier store on the new highway For two generations the hamlet that sprang up there was known as Harman s Corners It lay on the direct road to Toronto and it had its great days before the railway came In winter the laden sleighs went past by scores carrying wheat and meat and timber to the growing city and the drivers all stopped at the cross road The Corners supported three taverns all doing a thriving trade The fourth corner was occupied by the store As there were no other stores in that district Harman s had a monopoly of trade and its owner should have grown rich But the Harman of that day lacked business enterprise He was good natured slow procrastinating and spent more time at the taverns than behind his counter The store lost ground and when the railway was built and passed three miles away to touch at Woodville the Corners received its death blow Produce went to Toronto by rail instead of by sleigh or wagon Harman s was out of the line of traffic The three taverns closed one by one At Woodville the Elliott Brothers established an enterprising store with all the modern tricks of trade The farmers went thither to do their buying and Harman s stock grew shop worn and out of date Still Mr Harman clung to the business keeping no proper books but cherishing a vague idea that the store was maintaining his family while in fact it was losing money daily and all but ten acres of the farm had to be sold For the last two years he had been ill for nearly a year Carl had had virtually entire management and had discovered the truth During this time the Elliott Brothers had repeatedly offered to buy the store They wished to run it as a branch of their Woodville establishment and Carl had urged his father to sell Mr Harman however refused to entertain the idea for a moment and remained firm up to that March day when he died Mrs Harman had died four years earlier and the three children were orphans with what looked like a losing inheritance Alice was eighteen years old and had been keeping house for the family ever since her mother s death She was tall brown haired and gray eyed an out of door girl full of energy She was a great chicken raiser and an indefatigable gardener The bees she had had for three years starting with three hives and had already acquired a very cheerful bank account of her own from the sale of honey Bob was nineteen dark haired rather short and powerfully built His turn of mind was highly scientific and practical and he was trying to get through a course of electrical engineering at the Toronto School of Science where he was better known as a half back on the varsity team Carl was a year and a half younger than Alice and was her chief assistant with the bees but he lacked his brother s muscles He had an idea that something in journalism would suit him exactly but it was a long way from Harman s Corners to a daily newspaper office Meanwhile he looked after the store and attended the Woodville High School when he could riding to and fro on his bicycle and tried to prepare for the university But educational prospects looked rather bad just then Everything had to be subordinated to the question of making a living and Bob had come up from Toronto to help in threshing the matter out All the property had been left to the three children and an old neighbor and friend Isaac Ferguson was appointed executor and trustee till the heirs should come of age But an inventory of the property revealed a disastrous state of affairs All the land and buildings were heavily mortgaged Although no proper books had been kept it was plain that the store had not been paying expenses for a long time and there was an appalling collection of unpaid bills many of them bills for stock that had grown old and worthless When all these liabilities were cleared off there would not remain much more than a thousand dollars from Mr Harman s estate Part of this state of things was no surprise to Carl who had been in closer touch with the business than either Alice or Bob but even he rather inclined to the idea that it would be best to clear out the old stock at any price get in some fresh stuff and try to float the business for a little longer at any rate Even if we did sell out he argued we wouldn t get enough to live on for long and we d have no chance of making any more Elliott s would pay one of us forty dollars a month to stay here as clerk I was talking to them yesterday responded Bob That would be a good job for Alice No I ll never do that and I don t see how you could go to see those people cried Alice hotly If I only had a hundred hives of bees like these we wouldn t need anything from anybody she went on after a moment s indignation Why last year I made over one hundred and twenty five dollars from only eleven hives I wish we had them too said Carl but we haven t so what s the use Bees cost about ten dollars a colony here and hard to get at that I declare Allie you could get nearly as much for your apiary as the store is worth I wouldn t sell them though not for twenty dollars a hive the girl declared I d rather see the store go by a great deal What do you think we ought to do Bob I don t know returned her brother slowly Maybe I ve an idea but the present question to be settled is whether we want to accept Elliott s proposition to buy us out I mean They discussed the worrying problem all the rest of the afternoon and at supper and during the evening and at intervals the next day Then Bob had to return to his classes in Toronto and he went away leaving the matter still unsettled Spring came on with the breathless haste of the North The last patches of snow vanished The grass grew greener daily tulips were budding and the bees were gathering honey profusely from the pussy willows Alice and Carl went through the hives cleared out the winter s dirt from the bottom boards spaced the combs properly scraped away excrescences of wax and propolis They were so engaged when Bob suddenly appeared without any warning ten days after his departure Hurrah What s up shouted Carl pulling off his hat and bee veil and rushing to meet him You ve got some news I can see it Nothing much returned Bob Anyway I won t say anything about it just now Go ahead with your work And say have you got an extra hat and veil I d like to look on Bob had never handled the bees much nor taken any great interest in them so that both Carl and Alice were surprised at his request However they were too busy at the moment to discuss it and he was provided with a mosquito net veil which he draped about his hat He leaned over the hives as they were opened peered in and asked innumerable questions What s happened to you Bob said Alice at last You seem to want to learn the bee business Maybe said Bob enigmatically Now what s the best the bees ever do Alice How much honey do you get from them on an average Well this is my pet colony said the girl raising the cover from the hive nearest her Under the board cover was a canvas quilt which she peeled up revealing the tops of the combs each in its wooden frame At the disturbance a yellow froth of bees boiled up from between the combs but Alice unhesitatingly laid hold of one of the center combs and lifted it out for inspection It was covered on both sides with a thick layer of bees crowded as closely as they could stand There were some old veterans that had wintered over with shiny worn bodies and ragged wings there were just hatched bees fluffy and yellow like young chickens there were bees with yellow balls of pollen on their legs looking for an empty cell to store the bee bread They all remained quiet seeming but little disconcerted at being lifted so suddenly into the daylight Only the bees near the top of the comb where a little honey shone in the cells dipped their heads and began to suck it up in haste They felt that if this strange earthquake was going to destroy the hive they would at least save what they could Over Alice s fingers and bare wrists the bees crawled but made no attempt to sting They were the purest Italian breed and were almost as yellow as gold I paid a dollar and a half for this queen last year said Alice and look there she is now She indicated a point about the center of the comb where the queen twice the length of a worker bee but much more slender was walking slowly and with dignity over the cells looking into each one to see if it held anything Finding one unoccupied she gravely inserted the point of her long abdomen into it and deposited an egg During this process she was attentively watched by her own guard of half a dozen bees who kept their heads always pointed toward her and proffered her honey on their tongues when she had finished Day and night Alice explained this went on a good queen often laying a couple of thousand eggs in twenty four hours These eggs hatching in three weeks mean a vast army of workers for the honey harvest This colony brought me in more than twenty five dollars last year all by itself said Alice putting the comb carefully back into the hive It gathered something over a hundred pounds of comb honey worth twenty five cents a pound If one had a whole apiary like that but such things never happen On the average it s a good colony that makes ten dollars worth of honey and less than that of course if you were running a large apiary and only getting wholesale prices Well I call that good enough remarked Bob and said no more until that evening after supper when he consented to bring out what was in his mind It was only a vague notion that I got in my head he explained from what Alice said about wanting a hundred hives of bees Perhaps there s nothing in it yet I don t know But anyhow there s a fellow in our class who lives at a place called Morton away up in northern Haliburton and he mentioned to me about a month ago that a man up his way had a lot of bees for sale I wasn t especially interested then but when I went back to town last time I thought of it and made further inquiries Then I wrote to the owner Then I felt as if I ought to go up and look into the thing so I went You ve been there How many hives What s it like cried Alice and Carl together Just got back Well it s about the wildest roughest place I ever saw The bee outfit is fourteen miles from the railroad away back in the woods and you can take your choice of driving over a fearfully rocky trail or going up the river in a boat or tramping it The bees are on a deserted backwoods farm where nobody has lived for nearly a year Goodness knows why anybody ever went there in the first place But the bees are there all right a hundred and eighty colonies all packed outdoors in big sawdust cases It was too cold to open the hives but the bees were flying and seemed in good shape Very few if any were dead Then there s a great heap of apparatus stored in the barn a honey extractor empty combs supers for comb honey smokers a regular outfit in fact Yes but the price demanded Carl anxiously Fifteen hundred dollars That settles it then said Alice with a disappointed sigh Oh there s such a thing as buying on easy terms returned Bob Those bees belonged to a man who had no more sense than to try to start a farm among the rocks I m certain he never made anything out of the land but he surely did have the right instinct for beekeeping He died sometime ago his wife and children moved away and I guess everything he owned was mortgaged including the bees Anyway the whole outfit has come into the hands of the owner of the mortgage who lives at Morton a queer character if there ever was one He doesn t know what to do with all those bees Last summer he hired a man to look after them and the fellow either cheated or muddled for old Farr that s his name told me that there wasn t much money in bees and he thought of melting the combs all down for the wax But he d be glad to sell them and take easy payments He d let us keep them on the land rent free and he d take five hundred dollars cash down When we sell the summer s honey we pay another five hundred dollars and the rest in one year with interest at ten per cent a chattel mortgage on the bees and positive assurance that he ll sell us out if we don t come down with the money on the required dates Could we handle a hundred and eighty colonies We ve never had over a dozen here you know said Carl dubiously I ll guarantee that we could handle them I ll see to that cried Alice But could we make the money I believe we could said Bob earnestly The woods up there are full of solid masses of wild raspberry thickets for miles around where the timber has been cut or burned over Nothing yields honey like the raspberry bloom they tell me There s lots of basswood too Shouldn t we be able to get a hundred pounds of honey to the hive Alice It sounds to me as if we ought to It depends on the weather of course Well at ten cents a pound wholesale that makes eighteen hundred dollars that we could count on this year and next year we should get far more for the bees would have increased Why he exclaimed growing enthusiastic I don t see how we could possibly lose on it No clover up there I suppose asked Carl No nor grass either Nothing much but rocks and sand hemlock and jack pine and birch wild raspberries and little lakes and a deep river that runs right through the bee farm We d camp out there exclaimed Alice No there s a log house that we can live in But I ll tell you one thing living up there wouldn t cost us much I must have seen fifty partridges on my way in and the man that drove me told me that there are lots of deer and now and then a bear Once in a while a moose strays down from the North and there must be ducks on the river I know it s swarming with trout Of course we d be taking a chance on the season It s generally either a feast or a famine with the bees a big crop or a failure but what do you say Take the chance Take it cried Alice jumping up in excitement It does seem too good a thing to lose said Carl But we hardly want to exile ourselves up there in the north woods for years do we Why not I think it would be glorious said his sister But we don t have to The bees need to be looked after for only four or five months of the year They ve been up there for over a year with hardly any attention at all and they ve got on all right We can leave there in October sell our honey and come back here or go to the city or do anything take a trip to Europe if we ve had a good season Carl can go to the university Don t you see that it s the very thing for us It s the solution of all our difficulties The backwoods all summer and the city in winter It would give us some variety in life anyway said Carl Yes and there s no way of making money so nice as keeping bees It s sweet and clean and honest It s kid glove work too not muddy and dirty like farming And it s all scientific and fascinating Every colony has its own peculiar nature that has to be studied Some you can pet and some you have to bully No one could ever make any success with bees who didn t feel the fascination and wasn t full of the love of the thing Well you ve got love of it enough to supply the rest of us Alice though I believe we d all like it said Bob But we mustn t forget that we can t do anything without Mr Ferguson s consent We re infants in the eyes of the law and he s our guardian It was too late to go to see Mr Ferguson that evening but they talked over the scheme till nearly midnight They went into all the details and made calculations of their probable profits till they had worked themselves up into a high stage of enthusiasm As Bob said it hardly seemed possible to lose With a hundred and eighty colonies of bees in a good honey district they were sure to make some money but they began to feel desperately afraid that Mr Ferguson could not be made to see it in the same light The next morning they went to see him in a body primed with arguments To their delight however they found him by no means obdurate Their guardian was an elderly shrewd farmer who saw clearly that the store could never be made to pay and he had been pondering for some time upon the best investment for the orphans inheritance He promptly advised them to make the best bargain with the Elliott Brothers that they could but the idea of the apiary came upon him as a shock Fifteen hundred dollars worth of bees he said doubtfully A pretty big order ain t it Alice and Carl plunged at him with arguments and examples Mr Ferguson however knew the success that Alice had made with her bees and he was willing to listen questioning them closely about probable crops prices and risks He seemed in a fair way to be convinced but refused to give any answer at once saying that he was going to get the opinion of a cousin of his near Toronto who kept bees This must have been satisfactory for within a few days he announced his approval of the enterprise Bob immediately went to Woodville and closed the deal with the Elliotts Now that their dream was changed to reality it was something of a wrench to the young Harmans for the store seemed like an inseparable part of home itself But they had made up their minds and they went through with it Bob remained at home a little longer to help take the inventory of stock and complete the formal transfer and then suddenly there was a new sign over the door that had been Harman s for more than fifty years They also sold the ten acres of land The house and the garden and orchard they kept for only the direst necessity would have made them part with that There was still a mortgage of on it but the payments were easy and might be allowed to stand When all their other liabilities were paid up they found themselves with a capital of slightly over one thousand dollars which was a little more than they had expected When we ve paid our first five hundred on the bees said Carl we ll have nearly six hundred left That will be ample for us to live on till the honey crop is sold and after that there ll be money to burn Some of this capital however had to go toward Bob s expenses in Toronto It was of the utmost importance that his studies should not suffer for he was virtually sure of a well paid position after his graduation But I can take a week or ten days off he said and come up and help you get started I m well ahead with my work We needn t move up there till the middle of May My exams will be all over in June and then I can come up for the busy season with the bees That will be plenty of time for the raspberries don t blossom nearly so early up there as they do farther south The next thing was to buy the bees and this was arranged through Mr Ferguson and a lawyer at Morton They paid five hundred dollars down and gave a mortgage on the apiary for the rest covering whatever number of hives of bees it might contain This was a shrewd wording if not a tricky one for it not only released the seller from any responsibility as to the number of living colonies in the yard but it also covered any increase that might be made afterward The bees were not to be moved from the place without permission and they were to pay the second installment on August by which time they calculated the honey crop would be sold Now that all was settled Alice and Carl were impatient to be off It was hard to see Elliott s sign over Harman s store to see the old goods sold off at slaughter prices and to see the new paint woodwork and fresh stock that the old place was getting Alice declared that she would go all the way to Woodville rather than buy anything next door It was still early however to go into the north woods but toward the end of April Carl paid a flying visit to their new property and came back full of enthusiasm I hadn t time to look into many hives he said but I counted one hundred and twenty colonies carrying in pollen in great shape The maples must be coming in flower but everything looks pretty cold and dismal up there still The season seems fully a month later than here I looked into a few of the rest of the colonies Some were flying a little and I found only three dead ones On the whole I think they re coming into first class condition and I believe we ve got a bargain Alice was more impatient than ever at this news but a week of cold backward weather followed there were many preparations to make and it was another two weeks before they finally made ready to leave for the North It was decided that Carl should go a couple of days ahead of the others and try to make their quarters somewhat habitable Alice was to follow with Bob and he once more interrupted his studies for a week to come up and help with the last preparations With great care and consultation they got together an outfit that was slim for housekeeping or elaborate for camping as one might choose to regard it Alice selected blankets pillows cooking utensils and tableware Bob packed his fishing tackle and his rifle a good caliber repeater with plenty of cartridges They took two hams and a side of bacon from their own homecured stock beans two bags of potatoes flour sugar and other groceries together with several large loaves of fresh bread that Alice baked herself Another package had to be made of gardening implements a hoe a rake and a spade and an abundance of different seeds If she was going back to the land Alice said she was going to do it thoroughly An ax was needed too and a sharp hatchet a saw and hammer and assorted nails In fact there seemed to be no end to the things to be taken necessaries all of them One thing after another was forgotten and remembered at the last minute lamps and a washboard soap books a looking glass a pepper box In the end they had three huge packing cases and several small packages Alice had cherished a dim hope of being able to take a crate of her favorite White Leghorn hens to supply them with fresh eggs but she was forced to give that plan up They took the tools from the home apiary but the dozen hives of bees they left where they stood On the last day Alice equalized them in strength and put top stories of empty combs on all of them so that they could be left to themselves in comparative safety Carl then left for Morton taking with him a small trunk containing a supply of cooked food an ax a hammer his shot gun and his fishing rod Alice and Bob gave him forty eight hours start and then shipped their freight and took the train for the North At leaving they both felt a flood of homesick regret and misgiving Harman s Corners was the only home they had ever known and Alice s lips quivered when she looked back from the buggy as they drove to the station Bob himself felt a sudden doubt as to whether he had been right in proposing and urging the speculation A bad season a little hard luck and they would be utterly stranded and penniless But these forebodings gradually evaporated as the train went northward skirting Lake Simcoe crossing the Muskoka country running hourly deeper into the rocky wilds It was a slow local train and took more than half a day to make the journey so that it was late in the afternoon when they at last stepped out upon the board platform of the little Morton station A sharp chill in the air reminded them that they had come a hundred miles due north Morton had once been a flourishing lumber town operating four sawmills but the pine had long since been cut away and the place had greatly declined like Harman s Corners It seemed to consist of only a couple of dozen houses two or three stores and a frame hotel The dark evergreen forest apparently came close up to the town in every direction but Bob informed his sister that a few determined farmers tried to get a living out of the rocky soil and several French half breed families lived near the village contriving to support existence on a little lumbering a little trapping and a little guiding In November the district woke to temporary life with the influx of deer hunters from farther south It was much too late in the day for Bob and Alice to think of driving to the apiary so they went to the little hotel where at this season they were the only guests After engaging their rooms they proceeded to look up Mr David Farr who held the mortgage on the bees They found him in the post office and store which he owned He was postmaster and also as they learned later justice of the peace clerk of the township and road inspector Besides being the leading merchant of the town he bought furs and ginseng dealt in local mortgages occasionally traded in timber and had an interest in a mica mine that was trying to succeed near the village This last speculation seemed to indicate a sort of sporting spirit which was perhaps what had induced him to lend money on so risky a security as a yard of bees even at ten per cent interest He was a little withered man more than sixty years of age with white hair a straggly beard gimlet eyes and a not unkindly mouth Well here s the young people that s bought the bees he said wrinkling up his face into a dry smile You expect to make a fortune outer em hey young lady Well I don t say as you won t But you won t get what you expect to get Folks never does not in anything Oh we don t expect much Mr Farr said Alice laughing Now don t tell me that You know you do But it s always best to expect nothing and then be surprised and thankful Now whenever you re in town just come and see me and I ll do what I can to see you fixed right I m sure you re very kind Bob began No I ain t neither Don t you look for no kindness from me I want to help you to get along so s you can pay me my money Kindness and business is separate things and I always keep em separate As I told you young man if you don t live up to the terms of the mortgage I ll seize you up the minute the law allows me Now you both come along home with me and have supper They had supper with Mr Farr and his wife and slept at the hotel Next morning they found their freight boxes awaiting them at the station and hired a team to haul them to the apiary It was the same driver who had taken Carl out two days before and he mentioned the fact that Carl had borrowed his dog to keep him company till the others came As they were having their boxes and bales loaded on the wagon Mr Farr strolled up to see them start and he again impressed upon them his intention of being absolutely relentless in case they failed to keep to the strict terms of the sale And the old fellow means it too said Bob when they were off He ll sell us up in a minute if we don t produce the cash on the first of August I fancy we needn t fear him but what a wretched old skinflint he is I don t know said Alice laughing I rather like him It was fourteen miles to the bee farm and after the first mile from the village the road grew terrible In some places it was of corduroy logs It went up and down steep hills and for long stretches it was strewn with large loose rocks which made Alice s tinware clash and jangle in the boxes as the wagon lurched along It was impossible to go faster than a slow walk and even then the riding was so rough that Bob and Alice got down and walked for much of the way The May morning was sunny and warm and the highland air sparkling The road ran between dense tangled masses of second growth spruce and hemlock now and then broken by a wide burned slash thick with raspberry canes These were just beginning to grow green and the young beekeepers looked at them with great interest for their fortunes depended on these prickly jungles Now and then they caught a glimpse of a small lake Several times ruffed grouse rose with a roar and thunder behind the screen of evergreens and once their driver stopped to point out the slender delicate hoof mark of a deer on a bit of sandy road They had left Morton at eight in the morning It was after noon and they were hungry and tired with walking and sore with riding when the driver pointed with his whip across the hemlocks The trail curved suddenly There was a desolate stump filled clearing with the squat forms of several log buildings at the other end All about them stood rows and rows of large rude looking boxes painted dark red and above the creaking of the wagon they caught a deep distant roar of insect wings Oh cried Alice the bees orphans orphan The poor
