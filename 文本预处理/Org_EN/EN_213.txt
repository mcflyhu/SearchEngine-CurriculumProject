My sister and I breakfasted in the morning room in those days and we always had a fire for Bettina s sake on chilly mornings In the back of my mind I was hoping Eric s complaint of cold was an excuse If my first impression had been right if he had something to tell me he would tell it better indoors I should hear it better sitting beside him The pang when he passed the sofa by I was wrong I was an idiot He drew up before the ungenerous little fire and began at once to speak with suppressed excitement of a secret the sort of thing that well I wouldn t trust my own brother with it And upon that he stopped short I did not say You can trust me But I hardly breathed in the pause I felt it all hung on whether he told me What hung Why everything whether life was going to be kind to[Pg ] me some day whether it was well or ill that I had been born He seemed to be content with having told me there was a secret For he changed the subject abruptly to the Bungalow and what an adept Bootle was at inoculation and the preparation of cultures Bootle possessed the great and glorious faculty of accuracy One of the few men on earth whose account of a thing did not need to be checked Sitting over the fire that morning Eric told me that the Bungalow was a laboratory Very important work had been done there last autumn So that was why he had stayed on Tentative but highly significant results had been arrived at results which all these months of contest and putting to proof in London and on the Continent had not been able to upset Gods Eric exclaimed with a startling vehemence But this was a glorious place to work in The best air in England And the Bungalow had been an inspiration from on high Far away from noise and interruption and not merely for a few paltry hours Great stretches of time to himself Then you were so fit here [Pg ] You slept You had all your wits about you As we knew it was Hawkins s idea in the first place that Eric should come down and rest Well now I was to hear something more about Hawkins Hawkins was a kind of mascot He not only was the best man they d ever had in that chair at the University He wasn t only a first rate bacteriologist and first rate all round man There was something about Hawkins that struck fire out of other people His rooms were a meeting place for chaps keen about well about the things that matter Hawkins gave a dinner at his club one night to some London University men and a couple of distinguished foreigners Of course we talked shop We argued and stirred one another up and the sparks flew When the rest had gone Hawkins and I stayed talking in the smoking room About an idea Eric looked round to see that the door was shut a new idea I was working at for dealing with cancer Dealing I echoed leaning forward You mean curing I told Hawkins about an experiment I d been making As I ve said Hawkins is very intelligent [Pg ] But he contested my conclusions I grew hot We argued I told him more and more Hawkins thought my experiments too rough and ready Even if they weren t rough and ready to be conclusive they must be tried on an extended scale I stood up for the validity of tests on a small scale done with an infinity of care a ruthless spending of the investigator rather than multiplication of the subject All the same I couldn t deny that precious time was being wasted and many lives Hawkins was right I did need a trained staff and I needed oh masses of things I had not got and had no prospect of getting We had tried the forlorn hope of a Government grant and failed We agreed that in working out an idea like mine the crucial danger lay in premature publicity We are in a cleft stick in these matters Without the right people knowing believing helping it is hard pretty nearly impossible to go forward I sat rather dejected and stared at the fire The smoking room had been empty except for a little dried up old man who was half asleep over the evening papers A few minutes after Hawkins had gone out to pay his bill the little old man waked up[Pg ] and went to a writing table In a half minute or so I looked round and he was standing quite near me warming his back at the fire I ve been eavesdropping he said Lord I was scared How much had I given away I don t know anything about this subject he said But I ve an idea you do Anyhow I m willing to gamble on it My name s Pearmain he said and he showed me the signature on a cheque A thousand pounds to start you He laid the cheque down on the little table among the matches and cigar ends You can let me know when you need more he said He fished a card out of an inside pocket and chucked it on top of the cheque Naturally I was staggered He seemed right enough in his head but I was sure he couldn t be When Hawkins came back I introduced him We talked awhile longer Then the old man said good night The next day I cashed the cheque I gave up my post in the hospital and I gave up a lot of things After that I invested every ounce of energy I had in this undertaking For three solid years I ve done nothing thought about nothing except the one thing [Pg ] His eyes were shining as a lover s might I thought The sting of jealousy poisoned my pleasure in being taken into his confidence a renewed antagonism to the work work always work that made its triumphant claim You pretend to be more inhuman than you are I said For you don t forget that you can help people who have only ordinary everyday troubles Oh yes I do he laughed I ll have nothing to do with ordinary everyday troubles You helped us Oh that s different an exception Just for once He seemed to excuse himself for wasting time on us He said the most extravagant things A revolution might have swept England I should have gone on attenuating serums and inoculating guinea pigs It may have been something in my manner or just my silence that pulled him up He spoke of the share we at Duncombe had had in what s happened When I was clean worked out and dead beat I came here We hadn t any notion of the rest and refreshment the [Pg ] He looked at me out of those clear red brown eyes of his and seemed to deliberate A sense of delicious panic seized me And the the experiments How do they come on I asked but I wasn t thinking of them at all That he said sinking his voice that s just what I m coming to though I hoped I shouldn t tell you I didn t mean to say anything at all this morning except that I was going to be a hermit for these next days But you aren t a chatterbox The fact is last night I believe I stumbled on the secret I don t know what I said but it pleased him His eyes were full of gentle brilliancy Yes yes he said I knew you d understand Oh it was good to see him with that light in his face And we sat there with the morning sun shining over us and just looked gladness at each other Then I said I thought he must be the happiest man in England He half put out his hand and drew it back I am to find that out too very soon he said [Pg ] The clock downstairs chimed ten Eric jumped up like a person with a train to catch He had taken me into his counsels prematurely like this he said because he wanted to feel sure that I wasn t putting any wrong construction on the fact of his burying himself for these next days I like to think you are understanding If I have any good news I ll come and tell you If you don t hear you ll know I don t dare let go my clue even for an hour except to sleep And now he must go I went with him as far as the gate He walked with head bent and eyes that saw things hidden from me Already he was back in the Bungalow I felt the misery of being deserted But I felt too the strong intelligence the iron purpose in the man And though I was torn and aching I was proud For all my jealousy as I saw the mouth so firm set under the red brown thatch saw the colour in his face something reached me too of the heat of this passion to find out something of the absorption of the man of science in his task Here was the new kind of soldier going to his post [Pg ] I held out my hand Good luck He took it then dropped it quickly And quickly without once looking back he walked away I watched him hurrying across the links till one of the heath hollows swallowed him up As I turned to go back to my thyme planting I heard the dog cart rattling along the stony road Madame Aurore I never finished planting the thyme
