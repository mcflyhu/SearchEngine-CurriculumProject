Eve woke with the scent of hay in her nostrils and her hair was damp with dew She sat up and from that brown nook on the hill side looked out upon a world that was all white mist with a great silver sun struggling out of the east Each blade of grass had its droplet of dew The air was still as deep water From a wood in the valley came the sound of the singing of birds Her two companions were still asleep Joan Gaunt lying with her mouth wide open her face looking grey and old Eve picked up an armful of hay went a few paces forward and sat down so that she could see everything without having to look over the bodies of the sleeping women It was like watching the birth of a world The veil of white mist hid miraculous happenings and the singing of the birds down yonder was like the exultation of souls that beheld and marvelled Mystery The stillness seemed to wait In a little while the white veil would be withdrawn Then the vapour became full of sudden motion It rolled in great drifts rose broke into little wisps of smoke and half lost itself in yellow light The interplay was wonderful to watch Sometimes the mist closed in again hiding what it had half revealed only to drift away once more like torn masses of gossamer A great yellow ray of sunlight struck abruptly across the valley fell upon the wood where the birds were singing and splashed it with gold Then the mist seemed to be drawn up like a curtain Colour came into the landscape the bronze and yellow of the budding oaks the delicate green of young beech leaves the sables of yews and firs the blue of the sky the green of the fields It was all wet fragrant glittering like an elf world lifted suddenly out of the waters of an enchanted sea Someone sneezed Eve turned sharply and found Joan Gaunt was awake and sitting up Wisps of hay had got tangled in her hair her blouse looked like an impressionist sunset and one side of her face was red and mottled from lying on the canvas knapsack She had been awake for ten minutes and had pulled out a notebook and was scribbling in it with a pencil Eve thought that she was turning the May morning into a word picture but she soon noticed that Joan Gaunt s eyes did not rise above the level of her notebook Busy already Yes Isn t it wonderful What Why all that Eve swept a hand towards the valley where the smoking squadrons of the mist were in full flight before the gold spears of the sun It looks as though it has been abominably damp I m quite stiff and I ve caught cold She blew her nose hard and like the impervious enthusiast that she was resumed her scribbling Eve left her undisturbed and returning to her corner of the recess let her hair down and spent ten minutes brushing it She had very fine hair it reached well below her waist and Lizzie Straker who had just woke up found something to say on the subject It must be a nuisance having a fleece like that Why So beastly hot I should like to have mine cut quite short The obvious answer though Eve did not give it was that some people s hair did not matter She went exploring in quest of somebody who would provide them with towels and water and also with breakfast And when they did get breakfast at a little farmhouse over the hill her companions had to thank Eve for it for the farmer s wife was not a persuadable person and would certainly have refused anything to Joan Gaunt or Lizzie Straker Their white blouses were splashed and streaked with yellow but luckily the sitting room was rather dark and the farmer s wife was not observant But Eve had seen these blouses in the full sunlight and was candid in her criticism You must stop at the next village and buy a couple of new blouses Why what does it matter Lizzie Straker was in a touchy and argumentative mood They really look too terrible I don t care It is a reflection on those savages I suppose you don t want to be too conspicuous when you are out to burn houses This was sound sense and they halted that day within a mile or two of Horsham and let Eve go on alone to buy two new blouses The transfiguration was contrived in the corner of a wood and the egg stained relics were rolled up and stowed away in their knapsacks Apparently they were expected at Horsham not by the public or the police but by the elderly gentlewoman at whose front door Joan Gaunt knocked They were received with enthusiasm by an excitable lady with a high narrow forehead and prominent teeth She could talk nearly as fast as Lizzie Straker and she gave them a most excellent tea I think it is splendid perfectly splendid this heroic uprising of the women of England The Government can t stop us How can they stop us We have got the men stalemated Eve did not take to her hostess and their hostess did not take to Eve She looked at her with the veiled prejudices of a very plain woman for a girl who had more than good looks Moreover Eve had recovered her sense of humour and these enthusiasts were rendered suspicious and uneasy by a glimmer of fun in the eyes People who could laugh were not vindictively and properly in earnest They can t stop us They can t crush women who are not afraid of dying Isn t it glorious the way those noble girls have fought and refused to eat in prison I know one woman who kept four wardresses at bay for half an hour She kicked and struggled and they had to give up trying to feed her What fools we are making the men look I feel I want to laugh in the faces of all the men I meet Eve asked mildly And do you Do what Laugh when you meet them Well no not quite It wouldn t be dignified would it But I think they see the triumph in my eyes Their hostess had forgotten that a letter had come for Joan Gaunt and she only remembered it when Joan asked if it had arrived Of course how silly of me I locked it up in my bureau I was so fascinated listening to all your adventures She fetched the letter and Joan Gaunt read it She smiled her leathery smile and passed the letter over to Lizzie Straker To morrow night where the road to Godalming branches off from the Horsham Guildford road The hostess thrilled and upset her cup How exciting how splendid I can guess yes what you are going to do And you will be able to stay the night here How nice The people here are such barbarians so narrow I try to spread the great ideal but they don t seem to care At all events she treated them nobly and Eve was able to enjoy the sensuous delight of a good hot bath She went to bed early leaving her hostess and the two pioneers of progress sitting well forward in their chairs and debating the conversion of those women who clung sentimentally to the old traditions Their hostess was curious about Eve A probationer a novice I suppose She is learning the discipline I have very quick instincts I don t think I quite trust that young woman Lizzie Straker who was always ready to argue about anything simply because she had a temperament that disagreed rushed to defend Eve Why what s the matter with her She came down to starving point anyhow for a principle If that isn t being sincere what is Their hostess was not accustomed to being met and attacked with such impetuosity She doesn t strike me as belonging to us Why not As I explained it was my impression She doesn t strike me as being serious minded Anyway she didn t sit in a chair and theorise She s been through the real thing Joan Gaunt had to interpose for the gentlewoman of Horsham was showing signs of huffiness Mrs Falconer sent her with us Mrs Falconer That noble woman I am satisfied She should know They left Horsham about five o clock the following evening their knapsacks well packed with food The gentlewoman of Horsham dismissed them with the fervour of an early Christian and held Joan Gaunt s hands for fully half a minute It has been such an experience for me It has been like seeing one s dearest ideals in the flesh God bless you Joan Gaunt went striding along the Guildford road like a veteran centurion grim and purposeful Lizzie Straker had a headache and Eve offered to carry her knapsack and coat but Lizzie Straker had a kind of soldier pride She would carry her own kit till she dropped Don t fuss me old girl I m all right Eve enjoyed the long walk perhaps because her companions were silent A soft spring dusk was melting over the country Birds were singing There were yellow gates to the west The hedgerows were clean and unsoiled by dust and a delightful freshness distilled out of the blue green grass It was pitch dark long before they reached the point where the road branched off to Godalming though the sky was crowded with stars Joan Gaunt had bought a little electric hand lamp in Horsham and it served to light up the sign posts and the dial of her watch Here we are She had flashed the light on a sign post arm and read Godalming What s the time About half past ten Galahad won t be here till midnight No You have time for a rest Lizzie Straker was fagged out Eve could tell that by the flatness of her voice They went and sat in a dry ditch under the shadow of a hedge and put on their jackets for the double purpose of keeping warm and hiding their white blouses Lizzie Straker lay down with her knapsack under her head and in ten minutes she was asleep We won t talk No I m quite ready for a rest A couple of farm labourers passed one of them airing a grievance the condemning of his pig by some sanitary official I be unt a fool A touch of de joint evil dat s what it be But he comes and he swears it be tu ber coo lousis and says I be to slaughter d beast The voice died away bemoaning the fate of the pig and Eve felt a drowsiness descending upon her eyelids She remembered Joan Gaunt sitting erect and watchful beside her and then dreams came She woke suddenly to find two huge glaring eyes lighting the road They were the headlights of a stationary motor and she heard the purr of the engine turning dead slow Someone was speaking A high pitched jerky and excitable voice was giving orders Turn out the headlights Jones and light the oil lamps You had better shove in another can of petrol Well here we are on the tick what Joan Gaunt s voice answered him Last time you were an hour late That s good We had two punctures you know Where are the others Asleep in the ditch Eve woke Lizzie Straker The headlights went out suddenly and two figures approached one of them carrying the tail lamp of the car Hallo it s Galahad Lizzie Straker s short sleep had restored her vitality She spluttered enthusiastically at the man Hallo old sport here we are ready for the limelight Plenty of paraffin and shavings Rather He turned the lamp on Eve so that she could see nothing but a round yellow eye New comrade Greetings Joan Gaunt introduced them Mr Lawrence Kentucky Miss Eve Carfax We call him our Galahad The man laughed and his laughter was falsetto She could not see him except when he swung the lamp away from her and then but dimly but she received the impression of something tall fidgety and excitable Delightful One more fair lady to champion Great adventures great adventures Eve soon noticed that Lizzie Straker was particularly interested in Mr Lawrence Kentucky She hung close talking in slangy superlatives and trying to spread her personality all round him How many miles an hour to day Oh we came easy Respectable tourists you know All ready Jones All ready sir Supposing we heave up the anchor There s plenty of room for three at the back But what about the house Do you know it Rather We re thorough you know Jones and I went over all the ground two days ago We have it all mapped out to a T I m going to set light to this one Joan had the last All right your honour although Miss Gaunt s one up Joan Gaunt climbed in independently Lizzie Straker waited to be helped Mr Kentucky helped Eve because he had discovered something of the eternal feminine To Eve the adventure began by seeming utterly unreal Even when the motor drew up in a dark lane and the lights were turned out after the attacking party had loaded themselves with bags of shavings tow and a can of petrol she was hardly convinced that she was off to help in burning down a house She asked herself why she was doing it The spirit of revolt failed to answer in a voice that was passionate enough to be convincing They went in single file Lawrence Kentucky leading the way He carried an electric torch which he used from time to time like a boy out for mischief They climbed a gate crossed a grass field and came to a fence backed by straggling laurels and hollies There was a place where two or three of the fence palings were rotten and had been kicked in by Mr Kentucky when he had come to spy out the land They squeezed through one by one Someone whispered to Eve as she stooped to pass through Mind the nails I ll show you a light His torch glowed and she had a momentary glimpse of his face thin neurotic with restless eyes and a mouth that had the voracious look that one sees in men who are always hungry for some new sensation She could have imagined him swearing volubly laughing hysterically biting his pipe stems in two a whimsical egoist who rushed hither and thither to escape from being bored All right Rather like playing oranges and lemons She knew at once that he wanted to flirt with her but she had no desire to cut out Lizzie Straker They threaded through a big shrubbery and came out against a black mass piled in the middle of a broad lawn It was the house they had come to burn The kitchen window Jones at it with the glass cutter Who ll stay outside and keep cave Eve offered herself Why you ll miss half the fun I don t mind The grass on the lawn promised a good hay crop There was a wooden seat built round the trunk of an old lime and Eve settled herself there after the others had disappeared The night was absolutely soundless stars scattered like dust above the solid parapet and low roof of the red brick Georgian house It stood there mute deserted with sightless eyes and a sudden pity seized on Eve It was as though the house were alive and she was helping to do it to death Houses were part of life They held a spiritual and impalpable something that mattered They had souls She began to watch as though she was to be present at a tragedy with a feeling of tension at her heart Who had lived there To whom did the house belong Had children been born yonder and had tired eyes closed in death Had children played in the garden and under this tree It was illogical to pity bricks and mortar and yet this sentimental mood of hers belonged to those more exquisite sensibilities that save life from being nothing better than a savage scramble A streak of light showed at one of the windows Eve straightened herself rested her head against the trunk of the tree and held her breath The streak of light spread into a wavering fluctuating glow just as if the heart of the old house were palpitating angrily But Eve was allowed no leisure for the play of such phantasies The incendiaries returned Come along Lizzie Straker was almost hysterical It s going splendidly splendidly We found a big cupboard full of rubbish under the stairs I lit it Yes it s my work Eve became conscious of a growing indignation as they beat a retreat back through the shrubbery and across the field to the lane They ran and even the act of running seemed to her shameful What a noble business was this sneaking about at one in the morning with petrol cans and bags of shavings She snubbed Lawrence Kentucky when he pointed back over the field gate and chuckled She s going up in smoke all right We did that pretty smartly It has been heroic hasn t it To her he was no better than a mean little boy They crowded into the car The lamps were lit and the engine started The chauffeur drove dead slow along the lane That s it Jones crawl for half a mile and keep her as quiet as you can In another five minutes they were purring away into the darkness Eve when she glanced back could see a faint glow above the tree tops Lizzie Straker exulted There is something for them to talk about That will be in the papers to morrow Eve did not know how far they drove The car kept running for the best part of two hours Mr Lawrence Kentucky was finessing covering up their tracks so to speak He turned in his seat once or twice and spoke to Joan Gaunt Day was just dawning when the car pulled up This ought to do for you You are three or four miles from Farnham and this is Crooksbury Hill Eve threw aside her rug and climbed out They had stopped on a flinty road among the towering trunks of a wood of Scots firs The branches high overhead seemed a black tangle hanging in the vague grey light of the dawn Not a bough moved The great trees were asleep I ll be getting on Running to Oxford Put em off the scent Write and fix up the next London address you know He was saying good bye and receiving Lizzie Straker s more than friendly splutterings The chauffeur a swarthy young blackguard was grinning behind his master s back Mr Lawrence Kentucky stared hard at Eve for she was good to look at in the dawn light with the smell of the dew everywhere and the great trees dreaming overhead Au revoir Miss Carfax Hope you ve enjoyed it She gave him a casual nod and went and sat down on the bank at the side of the road Joan Gaunt and Lizzie Straker like the hardy veterans that they were lay down under the trees to snatch an hour or two s sleep but Eve felt wakeful and in a mood for thought The night s adventure had left her with an impression of paltriness and she kept picturing the black shell of the burnt house standing pathetically in the midst of its neglected garden She remembered Lawrence Kentucky s chuckle a peculiarly offensive and sneering chuckle Was that the sort of man who could be called a pioneer of progress or a knight of Arthur s Court It struck her as pathetic that these women should have christened him Galahad It just betrayed how little they knew about men She looked up at the tall trees and was instantly reminded of the fir woods at Fernhill A quiver of emotion swept through her It had been just such a dawn as this when she had fled from Orchards Corner She realised that she was wiser broader less sentimental now and that Canterton had not been the passionate visionary that she had thought him Lizzie Straker woke up and shouted Breakfast The gentlewoman of Horsham had fitted them out royally They had a tea kettle to boil over a fire of dead wood a big bottle of water ham sandwiches buttered scones and a tin of Swiss milk Even a tin opener had been included That breakfast under Crooksbury Hill reminded Eve of Lynette s fairy picnics in the Wilderness The larches would be all covered with green tassels She wished she was with Lynette in the Wilderness Breakfast over Joan Gaunt brought out her itinerary Where do we go next I ve forgotten Lizzie Straker licked a finger that had managed to get itself smeared with Swiss milk Let s see Something beginning with B wasn t it Yes Basingford The pupils of Eve s eyes dilated They were going to Basingford scent n v The air was filled with the scent of lilac The flowers
