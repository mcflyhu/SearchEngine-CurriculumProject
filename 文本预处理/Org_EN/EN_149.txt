It was the custom to change the stations of the different companies of a regiment about every two years So the autumn of found us on the way to Fort Halleck a post in Nevada but differing vastly from the desolate MacDermit station Fort Halleck was only thirteen miles south of the Overland Railroad and lay near a spur of the Humboldt range There were miles of sage brush between the railroad and the post but the mountains which rose abruptly five thousand feet on the far side made a magnificent background for the officers quarters which lay nestled at the bottom of the foot hills Oh what a lovely post I cried as we drove in Major Sanford of the First Cavalry with Captain Carr and Lieutenant Oscar Brown received us Dear me I thought if the First Cavalry is made up of such gallant men as these the old Eighth Infantry will have to look out for its laurels Mrs Sanford and Mrs Carr gave us a great welcome and vied with each other in providing for our comfort and we were soon established It was so good to see the gay yellow of the cavalry again Now I rode to my heart s content and it was good to be alive to see the cavalry drill and to ride through the canons gorgeous in their flaming autumn tints then again to gallop through the sage brush jumping where we could not turn starting up rabbits by the score That little old post now long since abandoned marked a pleasant epoch in our life From the ranches scattered around we could procure butter and squabs and young vegetables and the soldiers cultivated great garden patches and our small dinners and breakfasts live in delightful memory At the end of two years spent so pleasantly with the people of the First Cavalry our company was again ordered to Angel Island But a second very active campaign in Arizona and Mexico against Geronimo took our soldiers away from us and we passed through a period of considerable anxiety June of saw the entire regiment ordered to take station in Arizona once more We travelled to Tucson in a Pullman car It was hot and uninteresting I had been at Tucson nine years before for a few hours but the place seemed unfamiliar I looked for the old tavern I saw only the railroad restaurant We went in to take breakfast before driving out to the post of Fort Lowell seven miles away Everything seemed changed Iced cantaloupe was served by a spick span alert waiter then quail on toast Ice in Arizona It was like a dream and I remarked to Jack This isn t the same Arizona we knew in and then I don t believe I like it as well either all this luxury doesn t seem to belong to the place After a drive behind some smart mules over a flat stretch of seven miles we arrived at Fort Lowell a rather attractive post with a long line of officers quarters before which ran a level road shaded by beautiful great trees We were assigned a half of one of these sets of quarters and as our half had no conveniences for house keeping it was arranged that we should join a mess with General and Mrs Kautz and their family We soon got settled down to our life there and we had various recreations among them driving over to Tucson and riding on horseback are those which I remember best We made a few acquaintances in Tucson and they sometimes drove out in the evenings or more frequently rode out on horseback Then we would gather together on the Kautz piazza and everybody sang to the accompaniment of Mrs Kautz s guitar It was very hot of course we had all expected that but the luxuries obtainable through the coming of the railroad such as ice and various summer drinks and lemons and butter helped out to make the summer there more comfortable We slept on the piazzas which ran around the houses on a level with the ground At that time the fad for sleeping out of doors at least amongst civilized people did not exist and our arrangements were entirely primitive Our quarters were surrounded by a small yard and a fence the latter was dilapidated and the gate swung on one hinge We were seven miles from anywhere and surrounded by a desolate country I did not experience the feeling of terror that I had had at Camp Apache for instance nor the grewsome fear of the Ehrenberg grave yard nor the appalling fright I had known in crossing the Mogollon range or in driving through Sanford s Pass But still there was a haunting feeling of insecurity which hung around me especially at night I was awfully afraid of snakes and no sooner had we lain ourselves down on our cots to sleep than I would hear a rustling among the dry leaves that had blown in under our beds Then all would be still again then a crackling and a rustling in a flash I would be sitting up in bed Jack do you hear that Of course I did not dare to move or jump out of bed so I would sit rigid scared Jack what is it Nonsense Mattie go to sleep it s the toads jumping about in the leaves But my sleep was fitful and disturbed and I never knew what a good night s rest was One night I was awakened by a tremendous snort right over my face I opened my eyes and looked into the wild eyes of a big black bull I think I must have screamed for the bull ran clattering off the piazza and out through the gate By this time Jack was up and Harry and Katherine who slept on the front piazza came running out and I said Well this is the limit of all things and if that gate isn t mended to morrow I will know the reason why Now I heard a vague rumor that there was a creature of this sort in or near the post and that he had a habit of wandering around at night but as I had never seen him it had made no great impression on my mind Jack had a great laugh at me but I did not think then nor do I now that it was anything to be laughed at We had heard much of the old Mission of San Xavier del Bac away the other side of Tucson Mrs Kautz decided to go over there and go into camp and paint a picture of San Xavier It was about sixteen miles from Fort Lowell So all the camp paraphernalia was gotten ready and several of the officers joined the party and we all went over to San Xavier and camped for a few days under the shadow of those beautiful old walls This Mission is almost unknown to the American traveler Exquisite in color form and architecture it stands there a silent reminder of the Past The curious carvings and paintings inside the church and the precious old vestments which were shown us by an ancient custodian filled my mind with wonder The building is partly in ruins and the little squirrels were running about the galleries but the great dome is intact and many of the wonderful figures which ornament it Of course we know the Spanish built it about the middle or last of the sixteenth century and that they tried to christianize the tribes of Indians who lived around in the vicinity But there is no sign of priest or communicant now nothing but a desolate plain around it for miles No one can possibly understand how the building of this large and beautiful mission was accomplished and I believe history furnishes very little information In its archives was found quite recently the charter given by Ferdinand and Isabella to establish the pueblo of Tucson about the beginning of the th century After a few delightful days we broke camp and returned to Fort Lowell And now the summer was drawing to a close and we were anticipating the delights of the winter climate at Tucson when without a note of warning came the orders for Fort Niobrara We looked appalled in each other s faces the evening the telegram came for we did not even know where Fort Niobrara was We all rushed into Major Wilhelm s quarters for he always knew everything We Mrs Kautz and several of the other ladies of the post and myself were in a state of tremendous excitement We pounded on Major Wilhelm s door and we heard a faint voice from his bedroom for it was after ten o clock then we waited a few moments and he said Come in We opened the door but there being no light in his quarters we could not see him A voice said What in the name of but we did not wait for him to finish we all shouted Where is Fort Niobrara The Devil he said Are we ordered there Yes yes we cried where is it Why girls he said relapsing into his customary moderate tones It s a hell of a freezing cold place away up north in Nebraska We turned our backs and went over to our quarters to have a consultation and we all retired with sad hearts Now just think of it To come to Fort Lowell in July only to move in November What could it mean It was hard to leave the sunny South to spend the winter in those congealed regions in the North We were but just settled and now came another break up Our establishment now with two children several servants two saddle horses and additional household furnishings was not so simple as in the beginning of our army life when three chests and a box or two contained our worldly goods Each move we made was more difficult than the last our allowance of baggage did not begin to cover what we had to take along and this added greatly to the expense of moving The enormous waste attending a move and the heavy outlay incurred in travelling and getting settled anew kept us always poor these considerations increased our chagrin over this unexpected change of station There was nothing to be done however Orders are relentless even if they seem senseless which this one did to the
