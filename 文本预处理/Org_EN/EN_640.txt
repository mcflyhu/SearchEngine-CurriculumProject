I was now eager to begin the setting of the strawberry plants in the field where we had put potatoes but the recent heavy shower had kept the latter still green and growing During the first week in August however I found that the tubers had attained a good size and I began to dig long rows on the upper side of the patch selling in the village three or four barrels of potatoes a week for immediate use By this course I soon had space enough cleared for ten rows of strawberries and on the th of August Mr Jones came and plowed the land deeply going twice in a furrow Then I harrowed the ground and with a corn plow marked out the space with shallow furrows three feet apart Through five of these furrows Merton sprinkled a good dressing of the poultry compost and in the remaining five drills we scattered wood ashes Thus we should learn the comparative value of these fertilizers Then I made a rude tray with two handles so that it could be carried between Merton and myself When the sun declined we went to the strawberry bed and having selected the Duchess variety to set out first soaked with water a certain portion of the ground that was thick with plants Half an hour later we could dig up these plants with a ball of earth attached to their roots These were carried carefully on the tray to the field and set out in the furrows We levelled the ground first so that the crown of the plant should be even with the surrounding surface We set the plants a foot apart in the rows and by dusk had three rows out Early the next morning we gave these plants a good soaking in their new starting place and although the weather was now dry and warm not a leaf withered and all began to grow as if they had not been moved It seemed slow work but I believed it would pay in the end especially as Merton Winnie and I performed nearly all the labor We had now dispensed with Bagley s services a good word from me having secured him work elsewhere I found that I could not make arrangements for rebuilding the barn before the last of August and we now began to take a little much needed rest Our noonings were two or three hours long Merton and Junior had time for a good swim every day while the younger children were never weary of wading in the shallows I insisted however that they should not remain long in the water on any one occasion and now and then we each took a grain or two of quinine to fortify our systems against any malarial influences that might be lurking around at this season The children were also permitted to make expeditions to mountain sides for huckleberries and blackberries As a result we often had these wholesome fruits on the table while my wife canned the surplus for winter use A harvest apple tree also began to be one of the most popular resorts and delicious pies made the dinner hour more welcome than ever The greater part of the apples were sold however and this was true also of the Lima beans sweet corn and melons We all voted that the smaller ears and melons tasted just as good as if we had picked out the best of everything and my account book showed that our income was still running well ahead of our expenses Bobsey and Winnie had to receive another touch of discipline and learn another lesson from experience I had marked with my eye a very large perfect musk melon and had decided that it should be kept for seed They too had marked it and one morning when they thought themselves unobserved they carried it off to the seclusion of the raspberry bushes proposing a selfish feast by themselves Merton caught a glimpse of the little marauders and followed them They cut the melon in two and found it green and tasteless as a pumpkin He made me laugh as he described their dismay and disgust then their fears and forebodings The latter were soon realized for seeing me in the distance he beckoned As I approached the children stole out of the bushes looking very guilty Merton explained and I said Very well you shall have your melon for dinner and little else I intend you shall enjoy this melon fully So sit down under that tree and each of you hold half the melon till I release you You have already learned that you can feast your eyes only There they were kept hour after hour each holding half of the green melon The dinner bell rang and they knew that we had ripe melons and green corn while nothing was given them but bread and water Bobsey howled and Winnie sobbed but my wife and I agreed that such tendencies toward dishonesty and selfishness merited a lasting lesson At supper the two culprits were as hungry as little wolves and when I explained that the big melon had been kept for seed and that if it had been left to ripen they should have had their share they felt that they had cheated themselves completely Don t you see children I concluded that acting on the square is not only right but that it is always best for us in the end Then I asked Merton what have the Bagley children been doing since they stopped picking raspberries for us I m told they ve been gathering blackberries and huckleberries in the mountains and selling them That s promising Now I want you to pick out a good sized water melon and half a dozen musk melons and I ll leave them at Bagley s cottage to morrow night as I go down to the village In old times they would have stolen our crop now they shall share in it When I carried the present on the following evening the children indulged in uncouth cries and gambols over the gift and Bagley himself was touched I ll own up ter yer he said that yer melon patch was sore temptin to the young uns but I tole em that I d thrash em if they teched one Now yer see youngsters ye ve got a man of feelin ter deal with and yer ve got some melons arter all and got em squar too I hear good accounts of you and your children I said and I m glad of it Save the seeds of these melons and plant a lot for yourself See here Bagley we ll plow your garden for you this fall and you can put a better fence around it If you ll do this I ll share my garden seeds with you next spring and you can raise enough on that patch of ground to half feed your family I ll take yer up cried the man and there s my hand on it ag in God bless you and Mrs Durham added his wife We re now beginning to live like human critters I resumed my journey to the village feeling that never before had melons been better invested The Moodna Creek had now become very low and not more than half its stony bed was covered with water At many points light active feet could find their way across and not be wet Junior now had a project on hand of which he and Merton had often spoken lately A holiday was given to the boys and they went to work to construct an eel weir and trap With trousers well rolled up they selected a point on one side of the creek where the water was deepest and here they left an open passage way for the current On each side of this they began to roll large stones and on these placed smaller ones raising two long obstructions to the natural flow These continuous obstructions ran obliquely up stream directing the main current to the open passage which was only about two feet wide with a post on either side narrowing it still more In this they placed the trap a long box made of lath sufficiently open to let the water run through it and having a peculiar opening at the upper end where the current began to rush down the narrow passage way The box rested closely on the gravelly bottom and was fastened to the posts Short close fitting slats from the bottom and top of the box at its upper end sloped inward till they made a narrow opening All its other parts were eel tight The eels coming down with the current which had been directed toward the entrance of the box as has been explained passed into it and there they would remain They never had the wit to find the narrow aperture by which they had entered This turned out to be useful sport for every morning the boys lifted their trap and took out a goodly number of eels and when the squirmers were nicely dressed and browned they proved delicious morsels He Fell In Love With His Wife Allan Poe s stories
