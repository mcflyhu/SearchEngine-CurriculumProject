Ghysbrecht Van Swieten could not sleep all night for anxiety He was afraid of thunder and lightning or he would have made one of the party that searched Peter s house As soon as the storm ceased altogether he crept downstairs saddled his mule and rode to the Three Kings at Sevenbergen There he found his men sleeping some on the chairs some on the tables some on the floor He roused them furiously and heard the story of their unsuccessful search interlarded with praises of their zeal Fool to let you go without me cried the burgomaster My life on t he was there all the time Looked ye under the girl s bed No there was no room for a man there How know ye that if ye looked not snarled Ghysbrecht Ye should have looked under her bed and in it too and sounded all the panels with your knives Come now get up and I shall show ye how to search Dierich Brower got up and shook himself If you find him call me a horse and no man In a few minutes Peter s house was again surrounded The fiery old man left his mule in the hands of Jorian Ketel and with Dierich Brower and the others entered the house The house was empty Not a creature to be seen not even Peter They went upstairs and then suddenly one of the men gave a shout and pointed through Peter s window which was open The others looked and there at some little distance walking quietly across the fields with Margaret and Martin was the man they sought Ghysbrecht with an exulting yell descended the stairs and flung himself on his mule and he and his men set off in hot pursuit white lies mule n A mule is a cross between a mare and a donkey He is an old mule zeal n Revolutionary zeal caught them up and they joined the army They worked with great zeal to finish the project snarled v snarl The dog snarled at us As I advanced towards the dog It snarled and struck at me fiery adj She has fiery red hair His fiery speech agitated the crowd pointed adj He gave me a very sharp pointed pencil She wished to show Mrs John Dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother exulting vi He leaned back exulting at the success of his plan Jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity descended a A mood of melancholy descended on us The path descended the hill in a series of zigzags
