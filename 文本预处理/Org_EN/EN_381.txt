When Leslie and Peter went to Venice to pick up Berovieri goblets and other things Leslie stayed at the Hotel Europa and Peter in the Palazzo Amadeo The Palazzo Amadeo is a dilapidated palace looking onto the Rio delle Beccarie it is let in flats to the poor and in the sea story suite of the great bare dingy gilded rooms lived Hilary and Peggy Margerison and three disreputable infants who insisted on bathing in the canals and the boarders The boarders were at the moment six in number Peter made seven The great difficulty with the boarders Peggy told him was to make them pay They had so little money and such a constitutional reluctance to spend that little on their board The poor things said Peggy who had a sympathetic heart I m sure I m sorry for them and I hate to ask them for it But one s got to try and live She was drying Illuminato baptized in that name by his father s desire but by his mother called Micky before the stove in the great dining room Illuminato had just tumbled off the bottom step into the water and had been fished out by his uncle Peter he was three and had humorous screwed up eyes and a wide mouth like a frog s so that Hilary who detested ugliness could really hardly be fond of him Peggy was but then Peggy always had more sense of humour than Hilary A boarder looked in to see if lunch was ready It was not but Peggy began preparations by screaming melodiously for Teresina They heard the boarder sigh He was a tall young man with inspired eyes and oily hair Peter had observed him the night before with some interest That s Guy Vyvian Peggy told him looking for Illuminato s dryer suit in the china cupboard Fancy said Peter Yes said Peggy pulling out a garment and dropping a plate out of its folds on the polished marble floor There now Micky you re a tiresome little ape and I don t love you Guy Vyvian s an ape too entirely his one merit is that he writes for The Gem so that Hilary can take the rent he won t pay out of the money he gives him for his articles It works out pretty well on the whole I fancy they re neither of them good at paying so it saves them both bother pronto Teresina Subito subito cried Teresina from the kitchen I can t abide Vyvian Peggy resumed The babies hate him and he makes himself horrid to everyone and lets Rhoda Johnson grovel to him and stares at the stains on the table cloth as if his own nails weren t worse and turns up his nose at the food Poor little Rhoda You saw her The little thin girl with a cough who hangs on Vyvian s words and blushes when her mother speaks She s English governess to the Marchesa Azzareto s children Mrs Johnson s a jolly old soul I m fond of her she s the best of the boarders by a lot Now precious if you tumble in again this morning you shall sit next to Mr Vyvian at dinner You go and tell the others that from me It isn t respectable the way you all go on Here s the minestra at last Teresina clattering about the marble floor with the minestra screamed Pronto very loud and the boarders trailed in one by one First came Mr Guy Vyvian sauntering with resignedly lifted brows and looking as if it ought to have been ready a long time ago he was followed by Mrs Johnson a stout and pleasant lady who looked as if she was only too delighted that it was ready now and the more the better her young daughter Rhoda wearing a floppy smocked frock and no collar but a bead necklace coughed behind her she looked pale and fatigued and as if it didn t matter in the least if it was never ready at all She was being talked to by a round faced fluffy haired lady in a green dress and pince nez who took an interest in the development of her deplorably uncultured young mind a Miss Barnett who was painting pictures to illustrate a book to be called Venice Her Spirit The great hope for young Rhoda both Miss Barnett and Mr Vyvian felt was to widen the gulf between her and her unspeakable mother They who quarrelled about everything else were united in this enterprise The method adopted was to snub Mrs Johnson whenever she spoke That was no doubt why as Peggy had told Peter Rhoda blushed on those frequent occasions The party was completed by a very young curate and an elderly spinster with mittens and many ailments the symptoms of which she lucidly specified in a refined undertone to any lady who would listen with gentlemen however she was most discreet except with the curate who complained that his cloth was no protection Finally Hilary came in and took the head of the table and Peggy and the children took the other end Peter found himself between Mrs Johnson and Miss Barnett and opposite Mr Vyvian and Rhoda Mrs Johnson began to be nice to him at once in her cheery way Know Venice and when Peter said Not yet she told him Ah you ll like it I know So pleasant as it is Particlerly for young people It gives me rheumatics so much damp about But my gel Rhoder is that fond of it Spends all her spare time not as she s got much poor gel in the gall ries and that Art you know She goes in for it Rhoder does I don t now I m a stupid old thing as they ll all tell you She nodded cheerfully and inclusively at Mr Vyvian and Rhoda and Miss Barnett They did not notice Vyvian toying disgustedly with his burnt minestra was saying in his contemptuous voice Of course if you like that you may as well like the Frari monuments at once and have done Rhoda was crimson she had made another mistake Miss Barnett who disputed the office of mentor with Vyvian whom she jealously disliked broke in in her cheery chirp I don t agree with you Mr Vyvian I consider it a very fine example of Carpaccio s later style I think you will find that some good critics are with me She addressed Peter ignoring the intervening solidity of Mrs Johnson Do you support me Mr Margerison I ve not seen it yet Peter said rather timidly It sounds very nice Miss Barnett gave him a rather contemptuous look through her pince nez and turned to Hilary Lor whispered Mrs Johnson to Peter They do get so excited about pictures Just like that they go on all day squabblin and peckin each other Always at Rhoder they are too tellin her she must think this and mustn t think that till the poor gel don t know if she s on her head or her heels She don t like me to interfere or it s all I can do sometimes not to put in my word and say You stick to it Rhoder my dear you stand up to em and your mother ll back you But Rhoder don t like that Mother she says quite sharp Mother you don t know a thing about Art and they do You let be and don t put me to shame before my friends That s what she d like to say anyhow if she s too good a gel to say it Rhoder s ashamed of my ignorance that s what it is This was a furtive whisper for Peter s ear alone Having thus unburdened herself Mrs Johnson cleared her throat noisily and said very loud An what do you think of St Mark s That was a sensible and intelligent question and she hoped Rhoda heard Peter said he thought it was very nice That Rhoda certainly heard and she looked at him with a curious expression in which hope predominated Was this brother of the Margerisons another fool worse than her Would he perhaps make her folly shine almost like wisdom by comparison She exchanged a glance with Vyvian it was extraordinarily sweet to be able to do that so many glances had been exchanged propos of her remarks between Vyvian and Miss Barnett But here was a young man who thought St Mark s was very nice The dear Duomo Miss Barnett murmured protecting it from Tourist Insolence Mrs Johnson agreed enthusiastically with Peter I call it just sweet You should see it on a Sunday Mr Margerison Mr Peter as I should say shouldn t I all the flags flying and the sun shining on the gilt front an all and the band playing in the square an inside half a dozen services all at once and the incense floatin everywhere Not as I m partial to incense it makes me feel a bit squeamish and Miss Gould there tells me it affects her similarly don t it Miss Gould Incense I say don t it give you funny feelin s within Seem to upset you as it were Miss Gould disturbed in her intimate conversation with the curate held up mittened hands in deprecating horror either at the delicacy of the question called across the table with gentlemen present or at the memory it called up in her of the funny feelings within Mrs Johnson took it as that and nodded Just like me she is in that way But I like to see the worship goin on all the same Popish you know of course she added and then bethinking herself But perhaps you re a Roman Mr Peter like your dear brother and sister Well Roman or no Roman I always say as how Mrs Margerison is one of the best A dear cheery soul as has hardships to contend with and if she finds the comforts of religion in graven images an a bead necklace who am I to say her no Peggy said Hilary wearily across the table Illuminato is making a little beast of himself Put him out Peggy scrubbed Illuminato s bullet head dry with her handkerchief it had been lying in his minestra bowl slapped him lightly on the hands and said absently Don t worry poor Daddy who s so tired She was wishing that the risotto had been boiled a little one gathered from the hardness of the rice that that process had been omitted Vyvian who was talking shop with Hilary sighed deeply and laid down his fork He wondered why he ever came in to lunch One could get a much better one nearly as cheap at a restaurant Miss Barnett with an air of wishing to find out how bad a fool Peter was leaned across Mrs Johnson and said What are you to Venice Mr Margerison and Venice to you What I mean are you going to get out of her Which of her aspects do you especially approach She has so infinitely many you know What in fact is your connecting link She waited with some interest for what Peter would say She had not yet placed him Peter said Oh well I look at things you know much the same as anyone else I expect And I go in gondolas and then there are the things one would like to buy Mrs Johnson approved this Lovely ain t they Only one never has the money to spend I watch other people spending theirs said Peter which is the next best thing I suppose I m sorry I m stupid Miss Barnett but it s all so jolly that I don t like to be invidious Do you write she enquired Sometimes he admitted You re illustrating a book about Venice aren t you That must be awfully interesting I am trying she said to catch the most elusive thing in the world the Spirit of Venice It breaks my heart the pursuit Just round the corner always you know Browning s Love in a Life Heart fear nothing for heart thou shalt find her Next time herself not the trouble behind her Still the same chance she goes out as I enter Spend my whole day in the quest who cares It s like that with me and my Venice It hurts rather but I have to go on You shouldn t my dear Mrs Johnson murmured soothingly I m sure you should be careful We mustn t play tricks with our constitutions Rhoda kicked Peter under the table in mistake for her mother and never discovered the error Can you tell me Miss Barnett added abruptly in her cheerful voice where it hides Peter looked helpful and intelligent and endeared himself to her thereby She thought him a sympathetic young man with possibilities probably undeveloped Vyvian who regarded Miss Barnett and Venice Her Spirit with contemptuous jealousy thought that Rhoda was paying them too much attention and effectually called her away by saying If you care to come with me to the Schiavoni I can better explain to you what I mean Rhoda kindled and flushed and looked suddenly pretty Peter heard a smothered sigh on his left I don t like it Mrs Johnson murmured to him No I don t If it was you now as offered to take her But there I daresay you wouldn t be clever enough to suit Rhoder she s so partic lar You and me now we get on very well seems as if we liked to talk on the same subjects as it were but Rhoder s different When we go about together it s always Mother not so loud Oh mother you mustn t Mother that ain t really beautiful at all and you re givin of us away Mother folks are listening Let em listen is what I say They won t hear anything that could hurt em from me But Rhoder s so quiet she hates a bit of notice Not that she minds when she s with him he talks away at the top of his voice and folks do turn an listen I ve seen em But I suppose that s clever talk so Rhoder don t mind She raised her voice from the thick and cautious whisper which she thought suitable for these remarks and addressed Peggy Well we ve had a good dinner my dear plenty of it if the rice was a bit underdone A grain Miss Gould was murmuring to the curate a single grain would have had unspeakable effects Peggy was endeavouring to comb Caterina s exceedingly tangled locks with the fingers of one hand while with the other she slapped Silvio s Larry s bare and muddy feet to make him take them off the table cloth Not that they made much difference to the condition of the table cloth but still there are conventions It is a disgrace Hilary remarked mechanically that my children can t behave like civilised beings at a meal Peter what are you going to do this afternoon The boarders rose Mrs Johnson patted Peter approvingly on the arm and said I m glad to of had the pleasure One day we ll go out together you and me Seem as if we look at things from the same point of view as it were You mayn t be so clever as some but you suit me Now my dear I m goin to help you about the house a bit The saloon wants dustin I noticed Peggy sighed and said she was sure it did and Teresina was hopeless and Mrs Johnson was really too kind but it was a shame to bother her and the saloon could go another while yet She was struggling with the children s bibs and rather preoccupied The boarders went out to pursue their several avocations Rhoda and Mr Vyvian to the church of San Giorgio degli Schiavoni that Mr Vyvian might the better explain what he meant Miss Barnett round about and cheerful sketch book in hand to hunt for Venice Her Spirit in the Pescaria Miss Gould to lie down on her bed and recover from lunch the curate to take the air and photographs for his magic lantern lectures to be delivered in the parish room at home and Mrs Johnson to find a feather broom Hilary sat down and lit a cigar and Illuminato crawled about his legs I m going out with Leslie said Peter We re going to call on the prince and see the goblet and begin the haggling We must haggle though as a matter of fact Leslie means to have it at any price It must be a perfectly ripping thing Now let me have a number of The Gem to read I ve not seen it yet you know It s very dull my dear Peggy murmured rinsing water over the place on the table cloth where Silvio s feet had been Hilary was gazing into the frog like countenance of his youngest son It gave him a disappointment ever new that Illuminato should be so plain But your mother s handsome frog he murmured and I m not worse than my neighbours to look at But he knew he was better than most of them Let s hope you have intellect to make up Now crawl to your uncle Peter since you want to Illuminato did want to He adored his uncle Peter The Gem Peter said Hilary Bother the Gem As Peggy remarks it s very dull and you won t like it I don t know that I want you to read it to say the truth Peter was in the act of doing so He had found three torn pages of it on the floor He was reading an article called Osele Hilary glanced at it with the slight nervous frown frequent with him What have you got hold of Oh that His frown seemed to relax a little I really don t recommend the thing for your entertainment Peter It ll bore you I have to provide two things food for the interested visitor and guidance for Lord Evelyn s mania for purchasing So I am gathering Peter said I m reading about osele marked with the Mocenigo rose Signor Antonio Sardi seems to be a man worth a visit I must take Leslie there That s just the sort of thing he likes And sixteenth century visiting cards Yes he d like those too By all means we ll go to your friend Sardi You wrote this I suppose Hilary nodded His white nervous fingers played on the arm of his chair It seemed to be something of an ordeal to him this first introduction of Peter to the Gem Peggy assisting Teresina to bundle the crockery off the table shot a swift glance at the group at Hilary lying back smoking with slightly knitted forehead one unsteady hand playing on his chair at Peter sitting on the marble floor with the torn fragments of paper in his hands and Illuminato astride on his knee Peggy s grey Irish eyes were at the moment a little speculative touched with a dispassionate curiosity and a good deal of sisterly and wifely and maternal and slightly compassionate affection She was so fond of them all the dear babes Peter had gone on from osele to ivory plaques He was not quite so much interested in reading about them because he knew more about them for himself but he took down the name of a dealer who had according to the Gem some good specimens and said he should take Leslie there too Hilary got up rather suddenly and jerked his cigar away into a corner marble floors are useful in some ways and said Is Leslie going to buy the whole place up I m sick of these wealthy Jews They re ruining Venice Buying all the palaces you know I suppose Leslie ll be wanting to do that next There s altogether too much buying in this forsaken world Why can t people admire without wanting to acquire Lord Evelyn can t The squandering old fool he s ruining himself over things he s too blind even to look at properly And this Leslie of yours who can t even appreciate still must get and have of course and the more he gets the more he wants Can t you stop him Peter It s such a monstrous exhibition of the vice of the age It s not my profession to stop him Peter said And after all why shouldn t they If it makes them happy well His finality conveyed his creed if it makes them happy what else is there To be happy is to have reached the goal Peter was a little sad about Hilary who seemed as far as ever from that goal Why Peter wondered Couldn t one be happy in this lovable water city which had after all green ways of shadow and gloom between the peeling brick walls of ancient houses and beyond the broad spaces of the sea Couldn t one be happy here even if the babies did poise muddy feet on a table cloth not after all otherwise clean and even if the poor boarders wouldn t pay their rent and the rich Jews would buy palaces and plaques Bother the vice of the age thought Peter as he crossed the sun bathed piazza and suddenly smelt the sea There surely never was such a jolly world made as this which had Venice in it for laughter and breathless wonder and delight and her Duomo shining like a jewel An the sun shinin on the gilt front an all murmured Peter I call it just sweet He went in he was to meet Leslie there and the soft dusk rippled about him and beyond the great pillars stretched the limitless hazy horizons of a dream Presently Leslie came He had an open Stones of Venice in his hand and said Now for those mosaics Leslie was a business like person who wasted no time So they started on the mosaics and did them for an hour Leslie said Good Capital with the sober painstaking conscientious appreciation he was wont to bestow on unpurchasable excellence and Peter said How jolly and felt glad that there were some excellences unpurchasable even by rich Jews They then went to the Accademia and looked at pictures There Leslie had a clue to merit Anything on hinges I presume he remarked is worth inspection Only why don t they hinge more of the good ones They ought to give us a hint they really ought How s a man to be sure he s on the right tack After an hour of that they went to see the prince who had the goblet Half an hour s conversation with him and the goblet belonged to Leslie It was a glorious thing of deep blue glass and translucent enamel and silver with the Berovieri signature cut on it Peter looked at it much as he had seen a woman in the Duomo look up at her Lady s shrine much as Rodney had looked on the illumined reality behind the dreaming silver world Peter said My word suppose it broke It was natural that he should think of that things so often broke Only that morning his gold watch had broken in Illuminato s active hands Only that afternoon his bootlace had broken and he had had none to replace it because Caterina had been sailing his other boots in the canal Peter sighed over the lovely and brittle world Then he and Leslie visited Signor Sardi s shop and looked at osele and sixteenth century visiting cards Peter said he knew nothing about either personally but quoted Hilary in the Gem to Leslie s satisfaction Your brother s a good man said Leslie Knows what s what doesn t he If he says these are good osele we may take it that they are good osele though we don t know one osele from another That s right isn t it Peter said he supposed it was if one wanted osele at all which personally he didn t care about but one never knew of course what might come in useful Anyhow Leslie bought some and a visiting card belonging to the Count Amadeo Vasari which gave him much satisfaction Then they visited the person who the Gem had said had good plaques and inspected them critically Then they had tea at Sant Ortes tearoom and then Peter went home Hilary who was looking worried said Lord Evelyn wants us to dine with him to night and passed Peter a note in delicate shaky handwriting Good said Peter Hilary wore a bored look and said I suppose we must go and then proceeded to question Peter concerning Leslie s shopping adventures He seemed on the whole more interested in the purchase of osele than of the Berovieri goblet But said Peter presently your plaque friend wasn t in form to day He had only shams Rather bright shams but still So we didn t get any which I suppose will please you to hear Leslie was disappointed I told your friend we would look in on a better day when he had some of the real thing He wasn t pleased I expect he passes off numbers of those things on people as antiques You ought to qualify your remarks in the Gem Hilary add that Signor Leroni has to be cautiously dealt with or you ll be letting the uncritical plaque buyer through rather badly I daresay they can look after themselves Hilary said easily and Peggy added After all so long as they are uncritical it can t matter to them what sort of a plaque they get which of course was one point of view goblets n goblet Oh the goblets of the breast Oh the eyes of absence Divide the digestive biscuit crumbs mixture
