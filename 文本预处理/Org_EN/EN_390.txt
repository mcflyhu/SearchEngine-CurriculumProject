In September Peter and Rhoda had a son whom they called Thomas because Peter said he had a sceptical look about the eyes and nose Peter was pleased with him and he with Peter Rhoda wasn t much interested she looked at him and said he was rather like Peter and might be taken away now please Like me Peter wondered dubiously Well I know I m not handsome but Peggy a born mother took Thomas into her large heart at once with her out at elbows infants and was angry with Rhoda for not showing more interest You d think from the way of her that it was her thirteenth instead of her first she complained to Hilary I ve no patience with the silly mooning child She s nothing like good enough for Peter and that s a fact and she d have a right to realise it and try to improve for very shame instead of moping the way she does It s my belief Hilary that her silly little heart s away after the Vyvian man whatever haunt of wickedness he s adorning now I don t want to believe it of her but there s no end to the folly of the human heart is there now I wish she was a Catholic and had a priest to make her take shame to herself but there s no hold one has over her as it is for she won t say a word to me beyond Yes and No and Take him away please he tires me I nearly told her she d a right not to be so easily tired by her own son now she s getting her health But there she s a poor frail thing and one can t speak roughly to her for fear she breaks in two Hilary said After all there s no great cause for rejoicing in a man s being born into the world to trouble I suppose she feels that It will make it more difficult than ever for them and for us to make both ends meet Oh meet groaned Peggy that s not what there s any thought of their doing in these days my dear If one can bring them within a mile of one another one s thankful for small mercies Hilary rested his head on his hand and sighed Have you spoken to Peter yet about appealing to the Urquharts he asked Darling I have not and I m not going to Why should I annoy the poor child to no purpose He ll not appeal to the Urquharts we know that well and I m not going to waste my breath I d far rather What asked Hilary as she paused Oh well I don t know Don t you worry about ways and means something will surely turn up before long Peggy was an optimist And anyhow went on Peggy to change the subject from ways and means which was a depressing one isn t our little Peter a darling with his baby I love to see them together He washes it himself as often as not you know only he can t always catch it again when it slips through his hands and that worries him He s dreadfully afraid of its getting drowned or spoilt or lost or something It probably will said Hilary who was a pessimist Peter is no hand at keeping things We are not a fortunate family Never mind darling we ve kept three and more by token Kitty must have a new pair of boots this winter she s positively indecent the way she goes about now I can t help it Hilary you must pawn your ring again or something Peggy didn t want to say anything else depressing so she didn t mention that Miss Matthews had that morning given notice of her departure But in Peggy s own mind there was a growing realisation that something drastic must really be done soon October went by When Peter knew that the Urquharts had come back to London he wondered why Lucy didn t come to see Thomas So he wrote and asked her to and on that she came She came at tea time one day when Rhoda happened to have gone out So Peter and Lucy had tea alone together and Thomas lay in his crib and looked at them and Algernon snored on Lucy s knee and the November fog shut out the outer world like a blanket and blurred the gas light in the dingy room Peter thought Lucy was rather quiet and pale and her chuckle was a little subdued Her dominant aspect of clear luminousness was somehow dimmed and mystified with all other lights in this blurred afternoon Her wide clear eyes strange always with the world s gay wonder and mystery had become eyes less gay eyes that did not understand that even shrank a little from what they could not understand Lucy looked a touch puzzled not so utterly the glad welcomer of all arriving things that she had always been But for Thomas the latest arrived thing she had a glad welcome Like Peter she loved all little funny weak things and Thomas seemed certainly that as he lay and blinked at the blurred gas and curled his fingers round one of Peter s A happy silent person with doubts one fancied as to the object of the universe but no doubts that there were to be found in it many desirable things When Lucy came in Peter was reading aloud to him some of Traherne s Divine Reflections on the Native Objects of an Infant Eye which he seemed rather to like I that so long [Peter told him he was thinking Was Nothing from Eternity Did little think such Joys as Ear and Tongue To celebrate or see Such Sounds to hear such Hands to feel such Feet Such Eyes and Objects on the Ground to Meet New burnisht Joys Which finest Gold and Pearl excell Oo said Thomas expectantly A Stranger here [Peter told him further Strange things doth meet strange Glory see Strange Treasures lodg d in this fair World appear Strange all and New to me But that they mine should be who Nothing was That strangest is of all yet brought to pass Ow said Thomas agreeing Peter turned over the pages Do you like it Do you think so too Here s another about you But little did the Infant dream That all the Treasures of the World were by And that himself was so the Cream And Crown of all which round about did ly Yet thus it was I don t think you d understand the rest of that verse Thomas it s rather more difficult Yet thus it was We ll end there and have our tea Turning his head he saw that Lucy had come in and was standing behind him looking over his shoulder at Thomas in his crib Oh Lucy he said I m reading to Thomas Thomas is that Do you like him He is surprised at life but quite pleased He that was Nothing from Eternity did little think such Joys to celebrate or see Yet thus it is He is extraordinarily happy about it all but he can t do anything yet you know not speak or sit up or anything He can only make noises and cry and drink and slither about in his bath like a piece of wet soap Wasn t there a clergyman once who thought his baby ought to be baptised by immersion unless it was proved not well able to endure it as it says in the rubric or somewhere so he put it in a tub to try if it could endure it or not and he let it loose by accident and couldn t catch it again it was so slippery just like a horrid little fish and its mother only came in and got hold of it just in time to prevent its being drowned So after that he felt he could honestly certify that the child couldn t well endure immersion I m getting better at catching Thomas though He isn t supposed to slip off my hand at all but he kicks and slithers so I can t hold him and swims away and gets lost After tea will you come and help me wash him Rhoda s out to tea I m so sorry But there s tea and Thomas and Algernon and me and and rather thick bread and butter only apparently but I shall have jam now you ve come First I must adjust Thomas s drinking bottle he always likes a drink while we have our tea He s two months old Is he good for that do you think or should he be a size larger But I rather like them small don t you They re lighter so for one thing Is he nice Do you like him Lucy kneeling by the crib nodded He s very old and wise Peter very old and gay Look at his eyes He s much oh very much older than you or me That s as it should be He ll rejuvenate with years won t he said Peter At present he s too old to laugh when I make jokes he thinks them silly but he ll be sillier than anyone himself in about six months I expect Now we ll have tea Lucy left Thomas and came to the tea table and poured out tea for both of them I m trying to learn to do without three lumps said Peter as Lucy put them in I expect it s extravagant to have three really But then Rhoda and Thomas don t take any so it s only the same as if we each had one isn t it Thomas shan t be allowed more than one in each cup when he grows young enough to want any Rhoda and I mean him to be a refined person I don t think he will be said Lucy looking thoughtfully into the future I expect he ll be as vulgar as you and me He s awfully like you to look at Peter So I am informed Well I m not vain and I don t claim to be an Adonis like Denis Is Denis flourishing The birds were splendid they came so thick and fast that I gathered it was being a remarkable season But as you only answered my numerous letters by one and that propos merely of Thomas s arrival I could only surmise and speculate on your doings I suppose you thought the grouse were instead of letters They were Denis s letters I didn t shoot the grouse dear darlings nor send them What were your letters then Well I sent rowan berries didn t I Weren t they red Yes Even Thomas read them We re being rather funny aren t we Is Denis going on with Parliament again this autumn or has he begun to get tired of it Not a bit tired of it He doesn t bother about it particularly you know not enough to tire himself he sort of takes it for granted like going up to Scotland in August Peter nodded I know He would take it just like that if he was Prime Minister or Archbishop of Canterbury I daresay he will be one day isn t it nice the way things drop into his hands without his bothering to get them He didn t see the queer silent look Lucy turned on him as he spread his thick bread and butter with blackberry jam Thomas she said after a moment has dropped into your hands Peter It was as if she was protesting against something beating herself against some invisible eternal barrier that divided the world into two unequal parts Peter said Rather he has I do hope he ll never drop out I m getting very handy about holding him though Oh let s take him upstairs and tub him now do you mind So they took him upstairs and tubbed him and Lucy managed to hold him so firmly that he didn t once swim away and get lost As they were drying him Lucy dried him with a firmer and more effective hand than Peter who always wiped him very gingerly lest he should squash Rhoda came in She was strange eyed and pale in the blurred light and greeted Lucy in a dreamy absent way I ve had tea out Oh have you bathed baby How good of you I meant to be in earlier but I was late The fog s awful it s getting thicker and thicker She sat down by the fire and loosened her coat and took off her hat and rubbed the fog from her wet hair and coughed Rhoda had grown prettier lately she looked less tired and listless and her eyes were brighter and the fire flushed her thin cheek to rose colour as she bent over it Peter took her wet things from her and took off her shoes and put slippers on her feet and she gave him an absent smile Rhoda had had a dreamy way with her since Thomas s birth moony as Peggy who didn t approve called it A little later when Thomas was clean and warm and asleep in his bed they were told that Mrs Urquhart s carriage had come Lucy bent over Thomas and kissed him then over Rhoda Rhoda whispered in her ear without emotion Baby ought to have been yours not mine and Lucy whispered back Oh hush hush Rhoda still held her still whispered Will you love him Will you be good to him always And Lucy answered opening wide eyes Why of course No one could help it could they and on that Rhoda let her go Peter thought that Lucy must have infected Rhoda with some of her own appreciation of Thomas opened her eyes to his true worth for during the next week she was newly tender to him She bathed him every evening herself only letting Peter help a little she held him in her arms without wearying of his weight and wasn t really annoyed even when he was sick upon her shoulder an unfortunate habit of Thomas s But a habit Peter thought that Thomas employed with some discrimination for the one and only one time that Guy Vyvian took him in his arms or rather submitted to his being put there by Rhoda Thomas was sicker than he had ever been before with an immense completeness Just what I always feel myself commented Peter in his own mind as Thomas was hastily removed I m glad someone has shown him at last what the best people feel about him Vyvian had come to call It was the first time Peter had met him since his marriage he hoped it would be the last The object of the call was to inspect Thomas Rhoda said Thomas was inspected produced the impression indicated above and was relegated to the region of things for which Vyvian had no use He detested infants children of any sort in fact and particularly Thomas who had Peter s physiognomy and expressed Peter s sentiments in a violently ill bred way Peter a little later was very glad that Thomas had revealed himself thus openly on this occasion For it quite sealed Thomas s fate if anything more was needed to seal it than the fact that Thomas would be an impossible burden and also belonged by right to Peter Anyhow they left Thomas behind them when they went Rhoda wrote a scrawled note for Peter one foggy Monday morning and hugged Thomas close and cried a little and slipped out into the misty city with a handbag Peter coming in at tea time found the note on the sitting room chimney piece It said Don t try to follow me Peter for I can t come back I have tried to care for you more than him and be a good wife but I can t You know I told you when we got engaged that I cared for him and I tried so hard to stop and I thought I would be able with you to help me but I couldn t do it For the first few months I thought I could but all the time it was there like a fire in me eating me up and later on he began writing to me but for a long time I wouldn t answer and then he came to see me and I said he mustn t but he s been meeting me out and I couldn t stop him and at last it grew that I knew I loved him so that it was no use pretending any more I d better go Peter for what s the use of trying to be a good wife to you when all I care for is him I know he s not good and you are but I love him and I must go when he wants me It was all a mistake you and I ought never to have married You meant it kindly I know you meant to help me and make me happy but it was no use You and I never properly belonged When I saw you and Lucy together I knew we didn t belong not like that we didn t properly understand each other s ways and thoughts like you two did I love Lucy too You and she are so like And she ll be good to Baby she said she would I hate to leave Baby but Guy won t let me bring him and anyhow I suppose I couldn t because he s yours I ve written a list of his feeds and it s on the chimney piece behind the clock please make whoever sees to him go by it or he gets a pain Please be careful when you bath him I think Mrs Adams had better do it usually She ll take care of him for you or Peggy will perhaps You ll think I never cared for him but I do I love him only I must love Guy most of all I don t know if I shall be happy or miserable but I expect miserable only I must go with Guy Please dear Peter try and understand this and forgive me I think you will because you always do understand things and forgive them too I think you are the kindest person I ever knew If I thought you loved me really I don t think I d go even for Guy but I know you ve only felt kindly to me all along so I think it is best for you too that I should go and you will be thankful in the end Good bye You promised mother to see after me I know for she told me before she died well you ve done your best and mother d be grateful to you if she could know I suppose some would say she does know perhaps but I don t believe those stories I believe it s all darkness beyond and silence And if it is we must try and get all the light and warmth here that we can So I m going Good bye Peter Rhoda Peter read it through sitting on the rug by the fire When he had finished it he put it into the fire and watched it burn Then he sighed and sat very still for a while his hands clasped round one knee Presently he got up and looked behind the clock and saw that the next feeding time was due now So he rang for Mrs Adams the landlady and asked her if she would mind bringing Thomas s bottle When Thomas had it Peter stood and looked down upon him as he drank with ill bred noises Gently Thomas you ll choke You ll choke and die I know you will Then you ll be gone too Everything goes Thomas Everything I touch breaks everything I try to do fails That s because I m such an ass I suppose I did think I could perhaps make one little unlucky girl decently happy but I couldn t you see So she s gone after light and warmth and she ll she ll break her heart in a year and it ll be my fault Follow her No I shan t do that I shouldn t find her and if I did what would be the use If she must go she must she was only eating her heart out here and perhaps it s better to break one s heart on something than eat it out in emptiness No it isn t better in this case Anything in the world would have been better than this that she should have gone with that that person Yet thus it is And they ll all set on her and speak against her and I shall have to bear it You and I will have to bear it together Thomas I suppose I ought to be angry I ought to want to go after them to the end of the world or wherever they ve gone and kill him and bring her back But I can t I should fail in that too I m tired of trying to do things simply horribly tired of it Thomas He sat down on the rug with Thomas in his arms and there an hour later Peggy found them She swung in breezily crying Oh Peter all alone in the dark Where s Rhoda Why the silly children haven t had their tea she added looking at the unused cups on the tea table Peter looked up vaguely Oh tea I forgot I don t think I want any tea to day And Thomas has had his And Rhoda s gone It s no good not telling you is it because you ll find out She s gone away It s been my fault entirely I didn t make her happy you see And she s written out a list of the times Thomas has to feed at I suppose Mrs Adams will do that if I ask her and generally look after him when I m out Peggy stood aghast before him for a moment staring then collapsed breathless on the sofa crying with even more r s than usual Peter Why she s gone and rrun off with that toad that rreptile man Oh I know it so it s not a bit of use your trying to keep it from me Very well said Peter I suppose it s not Oh the little fool the little silly wicked fool But if ever a little fool got her rich deserts without needing to wait for purgatory that one ll be Rhoda Oh Peter be more excited and angry Why aren t you stamping up and down and vowing vengeance instead of sitting on the hearth saying Rhoda s gone as if it was the kitten I m sorry Peggy Peter sighed a little I m nursing Thomas you see Peggy at that was on her knees on the floor taking both of them into her large embrace Oh you two poor little darling boys what s to become of you both That child has a heart of stone to leave you to yourselves the way she s done Don t defend her Peter I won t hear a word said for her again as long as I live she deserves Guy Vyvian and I couldn t say a worse word for her than that You poor little Tommy come to me then babykins You must come back to us now Peter and I ll look after you both She cuddled Thomas to her breast with one arm and put the other round Peter s shoulders as he sat huddled up his chin resting on his knees At the moment it was difficult to say which of the two looked the most forsaken the most left to himself Only Thomas hadn t yet learnt to laugh and Peter had He laughed now softly and not happily It has been rather a ghastly fiasco hasn t it he said Absurd you know too in a way I thought it was all working out so nicely Thomas coming and everything But no It wasn t working out nicely at all Things don t as a rule do they There was a new note of dreariness in his voice a note that had perhaps been kept out of it of set purpose for a long time Now there seemed at the moment no particular reason to keep it out any more though fresh reasons would arrive no doubt very soon and Thomas when waking was a reason in himself But in this dim hour between two roads this hour of relaxation of tension in the shadowy firelight when Thomas slept and only Peggy listened Peter having fallen crashing through floor after floor of his pleasant house of life till he was nearly at the bottom looked up at all the broken floors and sighed Peggy s arm was comfortingly about him To her he was always a little brittle unlucky boy as she had first seen him long ago Never you mind Peterkin There s a good time coming I do believe She ll come back perhaps who knows Vyvian wouldn t do for long not even for Rhoda Besides you may be sure he ll throw her off soon and then she ll want to come back to you and Tommy I wouldn t say that to any other man because of course no other man would have her back but I do believe Peterkin that you would wouldn t you now I expect you d smile and say Oh come in you re just in time for tea and to see me bath Thomas and not another word about it Probably said Peter There wouldn t be much to say would there But she won t come back I know that Even if she leaves him she won t Rhoda s horribly proud really you know She d sooner sweep a crossing or trim hats or something than come near us again I don t know what to hope about it I suppose one must hope they ll go on together as Rhoda seems to like him as he is but it s an awful thought She s right that we never understood each other I couldn t you know bear to think of spending even one day alone with Vyvian I should be sick like Thomas The mere sight of his hair is enough and his hand with that awful ring on it I I simply draw the line at him Why does Rhoda care for him How can she Peter frowned over it in bewilderment Peggy said Girls are silly things And I suppose the way one s been brought up counts and what one s inherited and all that Well if Rhoda d taken after Mrs Johnson she wouldn t have liked Vyvian He used to give her the creeps like a toad She told me so She disliked him more than I did Well I shall never understand I suppose if I could Rhoda would have found me more sympathetic and might have stayed Now darling you re not to sit up and brood any more that won t help You re coming straight back with me to dinner and Tommy s coming too to sleep I shall ask Mrs Adams to help me get his things together He hasn t many things said Peter looking vaguely round for them I got him a rattle and a ball but he doesn t seem to care about them much Lucy says he s not young enough yet Here s his bottle And his night clothes are upstairs and his other day clothes and his bath Thomas leads the simple life though he really possesses very little I think he s probably going to be a Franciscan later on But he can sleep with me here all right I should like to have him only it would be awfully good of you if you d have him to morrow while I m out at work But in the night he and I rather like each other s company Rubbish said Peggy You re both coming along to fifty one this minute You don t suppose I m going to leave you two infants alone together like that We ve heaps of room at fifty one she sighed a little people have been fading away like the flowers of the forest and we should be thankful to have you back Oh we ll come then thanks very much Peggy Peter s ready sympathy was turned on again having temporarily been available only for himself and Rhoda and Thomas He remembered now that Peggy and Hilary needed it too He and Thomas would go and be boarders in the emptying boarding house it might amuse Thomas perhaps to see the other boarders And we ll have him baptized went on Peggy thinking of further diversions for Thomas and Peter You ll let him be a Catholic Peter won t you Thomas said Peter can be anything he likes that s nice As long as he s not a bigot I won t have him refusing to go into one sort of church because he prefers another he mustn t ever acquire the rejecting habit Short of that he may enter any denomination or denominations he prefers They were collecting Thomas s belongings as they talked Thomas lay and looked at them with the very blue slits that were like his father s eyes grown old And
