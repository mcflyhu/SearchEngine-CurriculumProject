So there had been no need for Audrey to plot for the removal of Madame Coralie s yashmak With the trifling aid of a tack which had caught the veil when the woman rose suddenly from the divan the truth immediately became known to the horrified and astonished girl But was it the truth At the first glance Audrey recognised the side face turned towards her as that of her mother But when Madame Coralie looked round fairly and the light filtering through the curtains of the shop window fell on her full countenance then Audrey became doubtful The wine dark birthmark which disfigured mouth and chin and cheek had been absent from Lady Branwin s face But but you are my mother gasped the girl still struck by the marvellous resemblance to the supposed dead I am not your mother replied the other coldly and evading the outstretched arms of her visitor But since you have seen my face I had better confess the truth I am your aunt Flora Oh Audrey recollected what her father had said about the two sisters of Bleakleigh Flora Arkwright Yes I see your mother told you about me No she did not Madame Coralie raised her hand imperatively This alcove is too public a place in which to discuss family matters We must go upstairs Indeed I fancy your exclamation of Mother must have aroused Badoura s suspicions Apparently this was true for when Madame Coralie drew her visitor through the pink silk curtains into the deserted shop Badoura was standing before them with an astonished look on her face Her employer at once sent her off on a false scent Miss Branwin has called to see me about her mother s death said Madame Coralie quietly She is slightly hysterical and you have no doubt heard what she cried out I trust the speaker looked anxiously round the shop that no one else heard I am alone here replied Badoura evidently accepting this explanation as a reasonable one Can I get Miss Branwin a glass of water No my dear said the owner of the shop who had replaced her yashmak I am taking up Miss Branwin to the still room for a little quiet conversation See that we are not disturbed Peri Banou Zobeide and Parizade are there Madame I shall send them down Give them something to do here Come Miss Branwin if you don t mind climbing the stairs Although Audrey felt considerably annoyed at being described as hysterical she nevertheless saw the necessity of some such explanation to satisfy the curiosity of the forewoman Therefore she wisely said nothing and followed Madame into the narrow back passage and up the stairs On arriving in the still room the elder woman dismissed her assistants and having looked behind the curtain to see that no one was hidden there likely to overhear the conversation she closed the door Audrey watched her as she sat down with her back to the window and tried to steady her nerves which naturally had sustained a shock Now Miss Branwin said Madame Coralie in a quiet voice we can talk But first so that you may be certain of my identity I shall lay this aside and she flung the long veil of the yashmak over her shoulder The girl examined that face carefully Madame Coralie was certainly extremely like Lady Branwin She had the same muddy complexion and large black eyes and the same stout shapeless figure But the aggressive birthmark made all the difference and after a single glimpse of it much less this cautious and lengthy survey there could be no question that the woman before her was not Lady Branwin But my mistake was natural said Audrey with a sigh Very natural answered Madame Coralie who had evidently followed her train of thought no very difficult thing to do especially as you first saw my side face The mark does not show when I look thus She adapted her position to her words and the resemblance became even more apparent Dora and I were twins ended Madame with a nod My father did not tell me that Oh so your father told you about me my dear I thought he had long ago forgotten the existence of poor Flora Arkwright Far from forgetting you Audrey assured her aunt he said that he wished he had married you instead of mother The information did not seem to please Madame Coralie for her thin lips tightened and she gave vent to a short laugh Then Audrey noted as a further difference between the sisters that the woman before her spoke in a hoarse and loud domineering voice Lady Branwin on the other hand had always talked softly and possessed a musical utterance which was one of the few poor charms she owned So Joseph remembers me in that way does he my dear said Madame Coralie clasping her hands Ha if I hadn t been a fool I should have married him Why didn t you asked Audrey bluntly I have stated the reason said Madame Coralie drily I was a fool But I am bound to say in my own defence that I never believed Joseph would become so wealthy He never struck me as particularly clever Yet he must be to have so much money There I disagree with you my dear I can call you my dear in private as you are my niece but Joseph was always hard and grasping and ever had an eye to the main chance Well he is rich and has now got rid of his wife so he can marry into the Peerage if he likes I expect Dora is glad she is dead now that she is on the other side of the grave Joseph killed her Killed her Audrey with a sudden fear turned deadly white Oh I don t mean to say that he strangled her said Madame Coralie hastily for he is too careful of his skin to risk hanging but his neglect killed her She was always a good and faithful wife to him and he broke her heart Papa was rather unkind said Audrey nervously but relieved by this explanation Madame again laughed shortly Unkind rather unkind she repeated Why he treated her like a brute She told me all about it Fancy the poor soul coming to me to be made young again in the hope that she could regain Joseph s affections I told her that she was a fool but she would waste her money And perhaps she wanted to help me also added Madame Coralie in a softer tone Dora was always fond of me She knew that you kept this shop Yes In fact she helped me to set up the shop some years ago I made her promise that she would never tell Joseph of my existence and she kept her word Yet Joseph remembered me Strange Papa said that you had the brains Madame Coralie looked round the room disdainfully And to what have my brains brought me I am simply a renovator of faded women and had to borrow money from Dora to set up the establishment Flora Arkwright is lost in Madame Coralie Mrs Edward Vail you mean said Audrey quietly Oh the woman shrugged her heavy shoulders I married Eddy so as to have a companion He s a handsome fool and goes about making love to younger women while he lives on my money However he is always good tempered and suits me well enough But in Bleakleigh I believed that my destiny would have been a better one Dreams my dear dreams You were born at Bleakleigh Madame Coralie nodded and folded her stout arms Then rocking to and fro she related her story and the story of her sister It was strange to Audrey this history of her mother s early life Lady Branwin had always been too much afraid of her husband to tell about her early struggles Dora and I were the daughters of a labourer said Madame Coralie She was very pretty and I well my dear who could be pretty with this and she touched the birthmark Although it was lighter when I was a girl I have tried so hard to remove it that I expect I made it worse If my customers saw it they would never believe that I could remove blemishes from their silly faces For that reason I always wear the yashmak My keeping what is called a Turkish shop gives me a chance of doing so I quite understand said Audrey gently But tell me about my mother Madame Coralie looked at her swiftly You were fond of her Of course Was she not my mother Besides she was all that was good and kind to me And added Audrey clenching her fist so tightly that her glove split if no one else will revenge her by finding out who killed her I shall do so I fear you have undertaken a search which will never be ended said her aunt in a pitying tone but the feeling does you credit I shall assist you by all the means in my power my dear for not only was poor Dora my sister but her death has harmed my business We can talk of what we will do later said Audrey quickly Meanwhile go on with your story A very dull story I fear my dear said Madame Coralie with a sigh Joseph like Dora and myself was the child of a labourer We lived next door to one another Then Joseph fell in love with Dora because she was pretty and went away to make his fortune The papers will tell you how he did so there is no need for me to talk about that But I will say that Joseph behaved well to Dora for he returned to marry her Then the ways of my sister and myself parted and she went on a golden road while I Madame Coralie glanced round the room again with great scorn while I made for this goal Did you not see my mother occasionally Not for many years my dear I got married to a gamekeeper the gamekeeper of Squire Shawe of Bleakleigh He was killed by poachers within a year of marriage and left me with a few hundred pounds in hand There was no child and there was nothing to keep me in Bleakleigh since my parents were dead so I came to London Then Madame Coralie shivered What happened then asked Audrey sympathetically Trouble I was born to trouble my dear Everything that could go wrong with me went wrong I tried the stage and failed I became a lecturer and lost my voice you hear how hoarse it is still I went to America as a lady s maid and was stranded there in San Francisco I worked as a typist I laboured in a laundry I took to reporting I edited a woman s paper and did all I could to keep myself above water As a reporter I was sent to Paris in the interests of the paper It failed and I went in for massaging people Then well to make a long story short I learnt from a friend of mine in Paris all kinds of secrets about the art of making women beautiful It struck me that I might start in London I came back and wrote to Dora There was no difficulty in finding her as she was by this time Lady Branwin the wife of a millionaire I am bound to say that Dora behaved very well She said nothing to her brute of a husband but managed in some way to get enough to start me in this business Then Madame Coralie stopped abruptly with a gesture That s all my dear And does the business pay asked Audrey mindful of what Ralph had said regarding the difficulties of the woman before her Yes That is it would pay if I could only get in the money But all my clients being women of fashion are such bad payers they ask for years of credit Then there s Eddy who is extravagant I was a fool to marry him but I did so for companionship I bought him so to speak so we understand one another perfectly Of course poor Dora s death has done a lot of harm to me but now that I have money to fall back on I hope to pull round It is weary work though said Madame Coralie looking very old weary work I am glad that you have saved money said Audrey who could not but acknowledge that her aunt was marvellously candid Saved money My dear have you not been listening to what I have been saying How could I save money with Eddy s extravagance and these customers who never will pay their bills It was Dora who came to my rescue She gave me her diamonds poor dear Audrey jumped up amazed Gave you her diamonds she echoed But you said at the inquest I know perfectly well what I said at the inquest and what I am saying to you interrupted Madame Coralie sharply I denied that I knew anything of the diamonds For obvious reasons I did so If I had admitted possession of the diamonds I would have been suspected as the person who strangled your mother No one knew that Dora and I were sisters You could have explained at No said Madame Coralie positively I could not have explained for my story would have appeared to be merely a made up one to account for the possession of the jewels Of course the resemblance for Dora and I were wonderfully alike save for this birthmark would have hinted that I was speaking the truth But in that case I should have had to remove my yashmak and then all the world would have known of this disfigurement It would have ruined my business my dear Audrey looked bewildered But if my mother was not strangled for the sake of the diamonds why was she killed Her aunt shrugged her shoulders I have asked that again and again and yet I think that I can see a way Dora brought me the diamonds pretending that she wished them to be reset When we were in the bedroom together she took them out of the bag and gave them to me Then she placed the empty bag under her pillow I came upstairs after tucking her in for the night in order to put away the jewels All I can think of is that someone got into the court by means of that skeleton key and thinking that the jewels were still in the bag strangled poor Dora and then escaped If you remember the label was found near the court door All this explanation was very frank and from the mere fact that Madame Coralie admitted having the jewels Audrey was certain that she was not the guilty person nor had she employed anyone else to commit the crime Besides as the two women were twin sisters and the likeness proved this beyond all doubt the idea of one murdering the other was out of the question I suppose said Audrey after a pause that you know some people suspect you Oh yes said her aunt indifferently and if they knew about the diamonds they would be certain of my guilt However I got Eddy to unset the stones and sell them separately He has been over to Antwerp selling them so I am quite safe that is she looked at Audrey unless you tell the police what I have told you I should not think of doing so said the girl anxiously for she really believed her aunt to be innocent and more than that I will try and disabuse Ralph of your guilt Ralph Oh yes Squire Shawe s younger son Poor Dora told me he was engaged to you Well is there anything else you want to know No but you must help me to find out who murdered my mother Certainly I shall do that for my own sake Come and see me again and I may be able to give you a clue Between us we may trace the assassin Oh aunt will you do this cried Audrey with shining eyes Madame
