In the course of this sad autumn of a new interest came up faint indeed and often lost sight of in the vivid pain and constant pressure of anxiety respecting their brother In the biographical notice of her sisters which Charlotte prefixed to the edition of Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey published in a piece of writing unique as far as I know in its pathos and its power she says One day in the autumn of I accidentally lighted on a MS volume of verse in my sister Emily s handwriting Of course I was not surprised knowing that she could and did write verse I looked it over and something more than surprise seized me a deep conviction that these were not common effusions nor at all like the poetry women generally write I thought them condensed and terse vigorous and genuine To my ear they had also a peculiar music wild melancholy and elevating My sister Emily was not a person of demonstrative character nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings even those nearest and dearest to her could with impunity intrude unlicensed it took hours to reconcile her to the discovery I had made and days to persuade her that such poems merited publication Meantime my younger sister quietly produced some of her own compositions intimating that since Emily s had given me pleasure I might like to look at hers I could not but be a partial judge yet I thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own We had very early cherished the dream of one day being authors We agreed to arrange a small selection of our poems and if possible get them printed Averse to personal publicity we veiled our own names under those of Currer Ellis and Acton Bell the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine while we did not like to declare ourselves women because without at the time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called feminine we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice we noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality and for their reward a flattery which is not true praise The bringing out of our little book was hard work As was to be expected neither we nor our poems were at all wanted but for this we had been prepared at the outset though inexperienced ourselves we had read the experience of others The great puzzle lay in the difficulty of getting answers of any kind from the publishers to whom we applied Being greatly harassed by this obstacle I ventured to apply to the Messrs Chambers of Edinburgh for a word of advice they may have forgotten the circumstance but I have not for from them I received a brief and business like but civil and sensible reply on which we acted and at last made way I inquired from Mr Robert Chambers and found as Miss Bront conjectured that he had entirely forgotten the application which had been made to him and his brother for advice nor had they any copy or memorandum of the correspondence There is an intelligent man living in Haworth who has given me some interesting particulars relating to the sisters about this period He says I have known Miss Bront as Miss Bront a long time indeed ever since they came to Haworth in But I had not much acquaintance with the family till about when I began to do a little in the stationery line Nothing of that kind could be had nearer than Keighley before I began They used to buy a great deal of writing paper and I used to wonder whatever they did with so much I sometimes thought they contributed to the Magazines When I was out of stock I was always afraid of their coming they seemed so distressed about it if I had none I have walked to Halifax a distance of ten miles many a time for half a ream of paper for fear of being without it when they came I could not buy more at a time for want of capital I was always short of that I did so like them to come when I had anything for them they were so much different to anybody else so gentle and kind and so very quiet They never talked much Charlotte sometimes would sit and inquire about our circumstances so kindly and feelingly Though I am a poor working man which I have never felt to be any degradation I could talk with her with the greatest freedom I always felt quite at home with her Though I never had any school education I never felt the want of it in her company The publishers to whom she finally made a successful application for the production of Currer Ellis and Acton Bell s poems were Messrs Aylott and Jones Paternoster Row Mr Aylott has kindly placed the letters which she wrote to them on the subject at my disposal The first is dated January th and in it she inquires if they will publish one volume octavo of poems if not at their own risk on the author s account It is signed C Bront They must have replied pretty speedily for on January st she writes again GENTLEMEN Since you agree to undertake the publication of the work respecting which I applied to you I should wish now to know as soon as possible the cost of paper and printing I will then send the necessary remittance together with the manuscript I should like it to be printed in one octavo volume of the same quality of paper and size of type as Moxon s last edition of Wordsworth The poems will occupy I should think from to pages They are not the production of a clergyman nor are they exclusively of a religious character but I presume these circumstances will be immaterial It will perhaps be necessary that you should see the manuscript in order to calculate accurately the expense of publication in that case I will send it immediately I should like however previously to have some idea of the probable cost and if from what I have said you can make a rough calculation on the subject I should be greatly obliged to you In her next letter February th she says You will perceive that the poems are the work of three persons relatives their separate pieces are distinguished by their respective signatures She writes again on February th and on the th she says The MS will certainly form a thinner volume than I had anticipated I cannot name another model which I should like it precisely to resemble yet I think a duodecimo form and a somewhat reduced though still clear type would be preferable I only stipulate for clear type not too small and good paper On February st she selects the long primer type for the poems and will remit l s in a few days Minute as the details conveyed in these notes are they are not trivial because they afford such strong indications of character If the volume was to be published at their own risk it was necessary that the sister conducting the negotiation should make herself acquainted with the different kinds of type and the various sizes of books Accordingly she bought a small volume from which to learn all she could on the subject of preparation for the press No half knowledge no trusting to other people for decisions which she could make for herself and yet a generous and full confidence not misplaced in the thorough probity of Messrs Aylott and Jones The caution in ascertaining the risk before embarking in the enterprise and the prompt payment of the money required even before it could be said to have assumed the shape of a debt were both parts of a self reliant and independent character Self contained also was she During the whole time that the volume of poems was in the course of preparation and publication no word was written telling anyone out of the household circle what was in progress I have had some of the letters placed in my hands which she addressed to her old schoolmistress Miss W They begin a little before this time Acting on the conviction which I have all along entertained that where Charlotte Bront s own words could be used no others ought to take their place I shall make extracts from this series according to their dates Jan th MY DEAR MISS W I have not yet paid my visit to it is indeed more than a year since I was there but I frequently hear from E and she did not fail to tell me that you were gone into Worcestershire she was unable however to give me your exact address Had I known it I should have written to you long since I thought you would wonder how we were getting on when you heard of the railway panic and you may be sure that I am very glad to be able to answer your kind inquiries by the assurance that our small capital is as yet undiminished The York and Midland is as you say a very good line yet I confess to you I should wish for my own part to be wise in time I cannot think that even the very best lines will continue for many years at their present premiums and I have been most anxious for us to sell our shares ere it be too late and to secure the proceeds in some safer if for the present less profitable investment I cannot however persuade my sisters to regard the affair precisely from my point of view and I feel as if I would rather run the risk of loss than hurt Emily s feelings by acting in direct opposition to her opinion She managed in a most handsome and able manner for me when I was in Brussels and prevented by distance from looking after my own interests therefore I will let her manage still and take the consequences Disinterested and energetic she certainly is and if she be not quite so tractable or open to conviction as I could wish I must remember perfection is not the lot of humanity and as long as we can regard those we love and to whom we are closely allied with profound and never shaken esteem it is a small thing that they should vex us occasionally by what appear to us unreasonable and headstrong notions You my dear Miss W know full as well as I do the value of sisters affection to each other there is nothing like it in this world I believe when they are nearly equal in age and similar in education tastes and sentiments You ask about Branwell he never thinks of seeking employment and I begin to fear that he has rendered himself incapable of filling any respectable station in life besides if money were at his disposal he would use it only to his own injury the faculty of self government is I fear almost destroyed in him You ask me if I do not think that men are strange beings I do indeed I have often thought so and I think too that the mode of bringing them up is strange they are not sufficiently guarded from temptation Girls are protected as if they were something very frail or silly indeed while boys are turned loose on the world as if they of all beings in existence were the wisest and least liable to be led astray I am glad you like Broomsgrove though I dare say there are few places you would not like with Mrs M for a companion I always feel a peculiar satisfaction when I hear of your enjoying yourself because it proves that there really is such a thing as retributive justice even in this world You worked hard you denied yourself all pleasure almost all relaxation in your youth and in the prime of life now you are free and that while you have still I hope many years of vigour and health in which you can enjoy freedom Besides I have another and very egotistical motive for being pleased it seems that even a lone woman can be happy as well as cherished wives and proud mothers I am glad of that I speculate much on the existence of unmarried and never to be married women now a days and I have already got to the point of considering that there is no more respectable character on this earth than an unmarried woman who makes her own way through life quietly perseveringly without support of husband or brother and who having attained the age of forty five or upwards retains in her possession a well regulated mind a disposition to enjoy simple pleasures and fortitude to support inevitably pains sympathy with the sufferings of others and willingness to relieve want as far as her means extend During the time that the negotiation with Messrs Aylott and Co was going on Charlotte went to visit her old school friend with whom she was in such habits of confidential intimacy but neither then nor afterwards did she ever speak to her of the publication of the poems nevertheless this young lady suspected that the sisters wrote for Magazines and in this idea she was confirmed when on one of her visits to Haworth she saw Anne with a number of Chambers s Journal and a gentle smile of pleasure stealing over her placid face as she read What is the matter asked the friend Why do you smile Only because I see they have inserted one of my poems was the quiet reply and not a word more was said on the subject To this friend Charlotte addressed the following letters March rd I reached home a little after two o clock all safe and right yesterday I found papa very well his sight much the same Emily and Anne were going to Keighley to meet me unfortunately I had returned by the old road while they were gone by the new and we missed each other They did not get home till half past four and were caught in the heavy shower of rain which fell in the afternoon I am sorry to say Anne has taken a little cold in consequence but I hope she will soon be well Papa was much cheered by my report of Mr C s opinion and of old Mrs E s experience but I could perceive he caught gladly at the idea of deferring the operation a few months longer I went into the room where Branwell was to speak to him about an hour after I got home it was very forced work to address him I might have spared myself the trouble as he took no notice and made no reply he was stupified My fears were not in vain I hear that he got a sovereign while I have been away under pretence of paying a pressing debt he went immediately and changed it at a public house and has employed it as was to be expected concluded her account by saying he was a hopeless being it is too true In his present state it is scarcely possible to stay in the room where he is What the future has in store I do not know March st Our poor old servant Tabby had a sort of fit a fortnight since but is nearly recovered now Martha the girl they had to assist poor old Tabby and who remains still the faithful servant at the parsonage is ill with a swelling in her knee and obliged to go home I fear it will be long before she is in working condition again I received the number of the Record you sent I read D Aubign s letter It is clever and in what he says about Catholicism very good The Evangelical Alliance part is not very practicable yet certainly it is more in accordance with the spirit of the Gospel to preach unity among Christians than to inculcate mutual intolerance and hatred I am very glad I went to when I did for the changed weather has somewhat changed my health and strength since How do you get on I long for mild south and west winds I am thankful papa continues pretty well though often made very miserable by Branwell s wretched conduct There there is no change but for the worse Meanwhile the printing of the volume of poems was quietly proceeding After some consultation and deliberation the sisters had determined to correct the proofs themselves Up to March th the publishers had addressed their correspondent as C Bront Esq but at this time some little mistake occurred and she desired Messrs Aylott and Co in future to direct to her real address Miss Bront c She had however evidently left it to be implied that she was not acting on her own behalf but as agent for the real authors since in a note dated April th she makes a proposal on behalf of C E and A Bell which is to the following effect that they are preparing for the press a work of fiction consisting of three distinct and unconnected tales which may be published either together as a work of three volumes of the ordinary novel size or separately as single volumes as may be deemed most advisable She states in addition that it is not their intention to publish these tales on their own account but that the authors direct her to ask Messrs Aylott and Co whether they would be disposed to undertake the work after having of course by due inspection of the MS ascertained that its contents are such as to warrant an expectation of success To this letter of inquiry the publishers replied speedily and the tenor of their answer may be gathered from Charlotte s dated April th I beg to thank you in the name of C E and A Bell for your obliging offer of advice I will avail myself of it to request information on two or three points It is evident that unknown authors have great difficulties to contend with before they can succeed in bringing their works before the public Can you give me any hint as to the way in which these difficulties are best met For instance in the present case where a work of fiction is in question in what form would a publisher be most likely to accept the MS Whether offered as a work of three vols or as tales which might be published in numbers or as contributions to a periodical What publishers would be most likely to receive favourably a proposal of this nature Would it suffice to write to a publisher on the subject or would it be necessary to have recourse to a personal interview Your opinion and advice on these three points or on any other which your experience may suggest as important would be esteemed by us as a favour It is evident from the whole tenor of this correspondence that the truthfulness and probity of the firm of publishers with whom she had to deal in this her first literary venture were strongly impressed upon her mind and was followed by the inevitable consequence of reliance on their suggestions And the progress of the poems was not unreasonably lengthy or long drawn out On April th she writes to desire that three copies may be sent to her and that Messrs Aylott will advise her as to the reviewers to whom copies ought to be sent I give the next letter as illustrating the ideas of these girls as to what periodical reviews or notices led public opinion The poems to be neatly done up in cloth Have the goodness to send copies and advertisements as early as possible to each of the undermentioned periodicals Colburn s New Monthly Magazine Bentley s Magazine Hood s Magazine Jerrold s Shilling Magazine Blackwood s Magazine The Edinburgh Review Tait s Edinburgh Magazine The Dublin University Magazine Also to the Daily News and to the Britannia papers If there are any other periodicals to which you have been in the habit of sending copies of works let them be supplied also with copies I think those I have mentioned will suffice for advertising In compliance with this latter request Messrs Aylott suggest that copies and advertisements of the work should be sent to the Athen um Literary Gazette Critic and Times but in her reply Miss Bront says that she thinks the periodicals she first mentioned will be sufficient for advertising in at present as the authors do not wish to lay out a larger sum than two pounds in advertising esteeming the success of a work dependent more on the notice it receives from periodicals than on the quantity of advertisements In case of any notice of the poems appearing whether favourable or otherwise Messrs Aylott and Co are requested to send her the name and number of those periodicals in which such notices appear as otherwise since she has not the opportunity of seeing periodicals regularly she may miss reading the critique Should the poems be remarked upon favourably it is my intention to appropriate a further sum for advertisements If on the other hand they should pass unnoticed or be condemned I consider it would be quite useless to advertise as there is nothing either in the title of the work or the names of the authors to attract attention from a single individual I suppose the little volume of poems was published some time about the end of May It stole into life some weeks passed over without the mighty murmuring public discovering that three more voices were uttering their speech And meanwhile the course of existence moved drearily along from day to day with the anxious sisters who must have forgotten their sense of authorship in the vital care gnawing at their hearts On June th Charlotte writes Branwell declares that he neither can nor will do anything for himself good situations have been offered him for which by a fortnight s work he might have qualified himself but he will do nothing except drink and make us all wretched In the Athen um of July th under the head of poetry for the million came a short review of the poems of C E and A Bell The reviewer assigns to Ellis the highest rank of the three brothers as he supposes them to be he calls Ellis a fine quaint spirit and speaks of an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted Again with some degree of penetration the reviewer says that the poems of Ellis convey an impression of originality beyond what his contributions to these volumes embody Currer is placed midway between Ellis and Acton But there is little in the review to strain out at this distance of time as worth preserving Still we can fancy with what interest it was read at Haworth Parsonage and how the sisters would endeavour to find out reasons for opinions or hints for the future guidance of their talents I call particular attention to the following letter of Charlotte s dated July th To whom it was written matters not but the wholesome sense of duty in it the sense of the supremacy of that duty which God in placing us in families has laid out for us seems to deserve especial regard in these days I see you are in a dilemma and one of a peculiar and difficult nature Two paths lie before you you conscientiously wish to choose the right one even though it be the most steep strait and rugged but you do not know which is the right one you cannot decide whether duty and religion command you to go out into the cold and friendless world and there to earn your living by governess drudgery or whether they enjoin your continued stay with your aged mother neglecting for the present every prospect of independency for yourself and putting up with daily inconvenience sometimes even with privations I can well imagine that it is next to impossible for you to decide for yourself in this matter so I will decide it for you At least I will tell you what is my earnest conviction on the subject I will show you candidly how the question strikes me The right path is that which necessitates the greatest sacrifice of self interest which implies the greatest good to others and this path steadily followed will lead I believe in time to prosperity and to happiness though it may seem at the outset to tend quite in a contrary direction Your mother is both old and infirm old and infirm people have but few sources of happiness fewer almost than the comparatively young and healthy can conceive to deprive them of one of these is cruel If your mother is more composed when you are with her stay with her If she would be unhappy in case you left her stay with her It will not apparently as far as short sighted humanity can see be for your advantage to remain at nor will you be praised and admired for remaining at home to comfort your mother yet probably your own conscience will approve and if it does stay with her I recommend you to do what I am trying to do myself The remainder of this letter is only interesting to the reader as it conveys a peremptory disclaimer of the report that the writer was engaged to be married to her father s curate the very same gentleman to whom eight years afterwards she was united and who probably even now although she was unconscious of the fact had begun his service to her in the same tender and faithful spirit as that in which Jacob served for Rachel Others may have noticed this though she did not A few more notes remain of her correspondence on behalf of the Messrs Bell with Mr Aylott On July th she says I suppose as you have not written no other notices have yet appeared nor has the demand for the work increased Will you favour me with a line stating whether any or how many copies have yet been sold But few I fear for three days later she wrote the following The Messrs Bell desire me to thank you for your suggestion respecting the advertisements They agree with you that since the season is unfavourable advertising had better be deferred They are obliged to you for the information respecting the number of copies sold On July rd she writes to the Messrs Aylott The Messrs Bell would be obliged to you to post the enclosed note in London It is an answer to the letter you forwarded which contained an application for their autographs from a person who professed to have read and admired their poems I think I before intimated that the Messrs Bell are desirous for the present of remaining unknown for which reason they prefer having the note posted in London to sending it direct in order to avoid giving any clue to residence or identity by post mark c Once more in September she writes As the work has received no further notice from any periodical I presume the demand for it has not greatly increased In the biographical notice of her sisters she thus speaks of the failure of the modest hopes vested in this publication The book was printed it is scarcely known and all of it that merits to be known are the poems of Ellis Bell The fixed conviction I held and hold of the worth of these poems has not indeed
