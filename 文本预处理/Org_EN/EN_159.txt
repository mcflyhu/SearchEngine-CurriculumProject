But while he had been working at a distance things had been going on apace at the ranch a progress which had now gathered such impetus that he found himself incapable of checking it The blow fell immediately after dinner that same evening Terence excused himself early to retire to the mysteries of a new pump gun Elizabeth and Vance took their coffee into the library The night had turned cool with a sharp wind driving the chill through every crack so a few sticks were sending their flames crumbling against the big back log The lamp glowing in the corner was the only other light and when they drew their chairs close to the hearth great tongues of shadows leaped and fell on the wall behind them Vance looked at his sister with concern There was a certain complacency about her this evening that told him in advance that she had formed a new plan with which she was well pleased And he had come to dread her plans She always filled him with awe and never more so than tonight with her thin homely face illuminated irregularly and by flashes He kept watching her from the side with glances I think I know why you ve gone away for these few days she said To get used to the new idea he admitted with such frankness that she turned to him with unusual sympathy It was rather a shock at first I know it was And I wasn t diplomatic There s too much man in me Vance Altogether too much while you She closed her lips suddenly But he knew perfectly the unspoken words She was about to suggest that there was too little man in him He dropped his chin in his hand partly for comfort and partly to veil the sneer If she could have followed what he had done in the past six days And you are used to the new idea You see that I m back before the time was up and ahead of my promise he said She nodded Which paves the way for another new idea of mine He felt that a blow was coming and nerved himself against the shock of it But the preparation was merely like tensing one s muscles against a fall When the shock came it stunned him Vance I ve decided to adopt Terence His fingertips sank into his cheek bruising the flesh What would become of his six days of work What would become of his cunning and his forethought All destroyed at a blow For if she adopted the boy the very law would keep her from denying him afterward For a moment it seemed to him that some devil must have forewarned her of his plans You don t approve she said at last anxiously He threw himself back in the chair and laughed All his despair went into that hollow ringing sound Approve It s a queer question to ask me But let it go I know I couldn t change you I know that you have a right to advise she said gently You are my father s son and you have a right to advise on the placing of his name He had to keep fighting against surging desires to throw his rage in her face But he mastered himself except for a tremor of his voice When are you going to do it Tomorrow Elizabeth why not wait until after the birthday ceremony Because I ve been haunted by peculiar fears since our last talk that something might happen before that time I ve actually lain awake at night and thought about it And I want to forestall all chances I want to rivet him to me He could see by her eagerness that her mind had been irrevocably made up and that nothing could change her She wanted agreement not advice And with consummate bitterness of soul he submitted to his fate I suppose you re right Call him down now and I ll be present when you ask him to join the circle the family circle of the Cornishes you know He could not school all the bitterness out of his voice but she seemed too glad of his bare acquiescence to object to such trifles She sent Wu Chi to call Terence down to them He had apparently been in his shirt sleeves working at the gun He came with his hands still faintly glistening from their hasty washing and with the coat which he had just bundled into still rather bunched around his big shoulders He came and stood against the massive rough finished stones of the fireplace looking down at Elizabeth There had always been a sort of silent understanding between him and Vance They never exchanged more words and looks than were absolutely necessary Vance realized it more than ever as he looked up to the tall athletic figure And he realized also that since he had last looked closely at Terence the latter had slipped out of boyhood and into manhood There was that indescribable something about the set of the chin and the straight looking eyes that spelled the difference Terence she said for twenty four years you have been my boy Yes Aunt Elizabeth He acknowledged the gravity of this opening statement by straightening a little his hand falling away from the stone against which he had been leaning But Vance looked more closely at his sister He could see the gleam of worship in her eyes And now I want you to be something more I want you to be my boy in the eyes of the law so that when anything happens to me your place won t be threatened He was straighter than ever I want to adopt you Terence Somehow in those few moments they had been gradually building to a climax It was prodigiously heightened now by the silence of the boy The throat of Vance tightened with excitement I will be your mother in the eyes of the law she was explaining gently as though it were a mystery which Terry could not understand And Vance here will be your uncle You understand my dear What a world of brooding tenderness went into her voice Vance wondered at it But he wondered more at the stiff standing form of Terence and his silence until he saw the tender smile vanish from the face of Elizabeth and alarm come into it All at once Terence had dropped to one knee before her and taken her hands And now it was he who was talking slowly gently All my life you ve given me things Aunt Elizabeth You ve given me everything Home happiness love everything that could be given So much that you could never be repaid and all I can do is to love you you see and honor you as if you were my mother in fact But there s just one thing that can t be given And that s a name He paused Elizabeth was listening with a stricken face and the heart of Vance thundered with his excitement Vaguely he felt that there was something fine and clean and honorable in the heart of this youth which was being laid bare but about that he cared very little He was getting at facts and emotions which were valuable to him in the terms of dollars and cents It makes me choke up said Terence to have you offer me this great thing It s a fine name Cornish But you know that I can t do it It would be cowardly a sort of rotten treason for me to change It would be wrong I know it would be wrong I m a Colby Aunt Elizabeth Every time that name is spoken I feel it tingling down to my fingertips I want to stand straighter live cleaner When I looked at the old Colby place in Virginia last year it brought the tears to my eyes I felt as if I were a product of that soil Every fine thing that has ever been done by a Colby is a strength to me I ve studied them And every now and then when I come to some brave thing they ve done I wonder if I could do it And then I say to myself that I must be able to do just such things or else be a shame to my blood Change my name Why I ve gone all my life thanking God that I come of a race of gentlemen clean handed and praying God to make me worthy of it That name is like a whip over me It drives me on and makes me want to do some fine big thing one of these days Think of it I m the last of a race I m the end of it The last of the Colbys Why when you think of it you see how I can t possibly change don t you If I lost that I d lose the best half of myself and my self respect You understand don t you Not that I slight the name of Cornish for an instant But even if names can be changed blood can t be changed She turned her head She met the gleaming eyes of Vance and then let her glance probe the fire and shadow of the hearth It s all right my dear she said faintly Stand up I ve hurt you he said contritely leaning over her I feel like a dog Have I hurt you Not the least in the world I only offered it for your happiness Terry And if you don t need it there s no more to be said He bent and kissed her forehead The moment he had disappeared through the tall doorway Vance past control exploded Of all the damnable exhibitions of pride in a young upstart this Hush hush said Elizabeth faintly It s the finest thing I ve ever heard Terry say But it
