And you are quite sure daddy I am not dreaming That I am sitting right here with my arms around your neck and you have just told me it is all perfectly true And to make still more certain that the whole matter was one of unquestionable reality the girl gave her parent such a flesh and blood hug that a physical answer came to her question in the shape of a protest from the very wideawake man Now see here Little Captain he remarked it is all very well to make sure we are not dreaming and that all the good news is real but please remember I have put on a clean collar and your tactics are quite military You are acquiring muscle Major Dale kissed his daughter fondly as she relinquished her hold on him and smoothed back a stray lock of his silvery hair I m so glad for you daddy she went on You do so need a real rest and now we will not have to plan every day what we may spend to morrow I fancy I will still keep the note book going with pounds and prices of things and an occasional orange and even some foreign fruit now and then Dear me I feel the good of that money already We can have so many luxuries no more scrimping and patching But daughter dear interrupted the major you must not imagine that mere money can bring happiness It depends entirely upon the proper use of that commodity we must always exercise good judgment whether one dollar or one hundred dollars are involved Oh of course I know we are not so very rich we cannot just exactly live sumptuously but we may live comfortably And really daddy now that it is over I may as well own up I have longed with the longest kind of longing for a brand new hat May I really have one Ribbons and all Two one for Sunday and one for every day promptly responded the major laughing But your hats always look new They do say I have talent for hats and that one must have originality to trim and keep old head gear up to date So daddy dear perhaps some day that hint of talent may develop I may be an artist or something Then I will bless the days when I had to make over hats to discover myself and Dorothy promptly clapped upon her blond head such a confusion of straw and flowers to say nothing of the dangling blue ribbons that even the major with his limited appreciation of keeping old head gear up to date was forced to acknowledge that his daughter did know how to trim a hat When will the money come she asked tilting her head to one side to get a look in the small oval mirror that was sufficiently large for the major s neckties but was plainly too short for hats We won t get it by the pound like butter you know daughter Nor is it a matter of so many blank checks to be filled out as we progress with penmanship like copy book work As a matter of fact I have just received the legal information that my dear old soldier uncle Ned otherwise known as Captain Edward Dale on the retired list resident of India subject of Great Britain has answered the last roll call and left what he had to me Uncle Ned was the hero of our family daughter dear and some day I will tell you why you are my Little Captain his own successor and the major laid his hand upon Dorothy s shoulder in a way he had of making a promise that he intended to keep A commotion on the side porch interrupted their confidences and the major took advantage of it to make his escape He kissed Dorothy good bye and left her to the commotion that presently made its way in at the door in the shape of Tavia Travers Dorothy s warmest friend in every thing Hurrah for the good news shouted Tavia flinging her sailor hat up to the ceiling and catching it as promptly Three cheers for the money When will it come Give a feller some Tiddle umtum tum I have to say bunny To make a rhyme with money And Tavia swung around like a pin wheel to bring her verse to an effective full stop a way she had of punctuating her impromptu productions Dorothy made a comical squat to add more finish and then the two girls feeling better for having opened the safety valve of physical exertion to let off mental exuberance sat down to talk it over quietly Are you perfectly positive certain sure that it s just you Dorothy Dale and no fairy or mermaid began Tavia settling herself among the cushions on Major Dale s sofa Of all the delicious delectable things To have a rich old uncle die way off in India where you don t even have to make your nose red at his funeral And to leave you a million dollars Oh not quite a million interrupted Dorothy Something considerable less than that I believe But it s all kinds of money I know went on the other Dear me I do wish some kind of money would run in our family even with red noses thrown in But no such luck When we have a funeral we always have to pay for the coach Tavia Travers How dare you talk so of such serious things How else would you have me talk of serious things The most serious thing in my life is money its scarcity Funerals of course take time and are unpleasant in many respects but for right at home trouble it s money It is nice to think that the dear old captain should be so good to father said Dorothy Father was always his favorite relative and he particularly liked him on account of his military honors Well he ought to of course put in Tavia for your father keeps the name Dale up for military honors But what in the world are you going to do with all the money Don t for goodness sake go away for your health and other things and leave poor me to die here without nobody nor nuthin and the girl burst into make believe tears Indeed said Dorothy We can enjoy the good fortune in no place better than in dear old Dalton and among our own good friends and she put her arms affectionately about Tavia But one thing has been definitely decided upon You are going to buy the Harvy mansion No a new hat Father has just this minute given his consent Make it a tiara and save the expense of hat pins suggested Tavia No I have a hankering for a Gainsborough the kind the lady hanging over Aunt Winnie s stairs wears the picture queen you know Oh yes she looks very nice in a picture over the stairs remarked Tavia but my advice to you would be to wear elastic under your chin with a thing like that or else try Gulliver s Glue One breeze of the Dalton kind would be enough for a Gainsborough You shall help me pick it out agreed Dorothy In the meantime don t sit on the only one I have I just left it on the sofa as you came in And if it isn t the dearest sweetest thing now exclaimed Tavia rescuing the mass of perishables she had unwittingly pressed into something like a funeral piece Oh exclaimed Dorothy I did like that hat And so did I declared Tavia That hat was a stunner and I deeply regret it s untimely taking away it went to pieces without a groan That comes of having a real Leghorn I could sit all over my poor straw pancake and it would not as much as bend couldn t It would have no place to bend to You could never wear anything that would become you more than a simple sailor said Dorothy with the air of one in authority and if I had your short locks I would just sport a jaunty little felt sailor all summer But with my head Jaunty doesn t go I quite agree with you picture lady your head is cut out for picture hats Another positive evidence of money running in your family my head was cut out for an economical pattern lucky thing for me and Tavia clapped her aforesaid sailor on her bronze head at a decidedly rakish angle while Dorothy busied herself with a thorough investigation of the wreck of her own headpiece As told in Dorothy Dale A Girl of To Day the first book of this series these two girls Dorothy Dale and Octavia Travers were school friends home friends and all kinds of friends both about the same age and both living in a little interesting town called Dalton in New York state Dorothy was the daughter of Major Dale a prominent citizen of the place while Tavia s father was Squire Travers a man who was largely indebted to Dorothy for the office he held inasmuch as she had managed in a girl s way to bring about his election Tavia had a brother Johnnie quite an ordinary boy while Dorothy had two brothers Joe aged nine and Roger aged seven years There was one other member of the Dale household Mrs Martin the housekeeper who had cared for the children since their mother had been called away She was that sort of responsible aged woman who seems to grow more and more particular with years and perhaps her only fault if it might be termed such was her excessive care of Roger her baby she insisted for to her his seven years by no means constituted a length of time sufficient to make a boy of him The children called Mrs Martin Aunt Libby and to them she was indeed as kind and loving as any aunt could be Dorothy had an aunt Mrs Winthrop White of North Birchland in summer and of the city in winter a woman of social importance as well as being a most lovable and charming lady personally A visit of Dorothy and Tavia to the Cedars Mrs White s country place as related in Dorothy Dale was full of incidents and in the present volume we shall become still better acquainted with the family which included Mrs White s two sons Ned and Nat both young men well worth knowing Dorothy and Tavia might well rejoice in the good news that the major had so lately been informed of for the acquirement of means to Dorothy would undoubtedly bring good times to Tavia and both deserved the prospects of sunshine and laughter for alas in all lives even those scarcely old enough to take upon their shoulders the burden of cares there comes some blot to mar the page some speck to break the glorious blue of the noonday sky Dorothy Dale was not without her sorrow A wicked man Andrew Anderson by name had come into her life in a mysterious way Dorothy had befriended and in her own way helped back to a day of happiness an unfortunate man Miles Burlock This man had for years been in the strange power of Anderson but before it was too late Dorothy had helped Burlock break the chains of strong drink that seemed to have bound him to the evil companion and for this interference she had suffered she was now the object of Anderson s hatred Anderson was after the money that Miles Burlock had to leave at his death but Dorothy and her father saved this for its rightful owner a little daughter of Miles Burlock who had for some years been kept away from her own father by Anderson The child now an orphan came into the care of Major Dale her legal guardian and so Anderson had new cause for his hatred for Dorothy the money and child having both been put out of his reach So this was Dorothy s sorrow she had been persecuted because of her goodness No one who knew Tavia Travers would have considered her capable of worry She was as light hearted as air with a great faculty for mischief and a hankering for fun But she did have a worry a fear that some day Dorothy Dale might pass out of her life and end the attachment that came in childhood and waxed strong with girlhood Dorothy was what might be considered a girl of the aristocratic class while Tavia belonged to those who consider it a privilege to work for a living and have a keen appreciation of the opportunity as Squire Travers proved when he turned in to show himself the best official in the capacity of squire of which Dalton ever boasted Now a new danger threatened Tavia Dorothy would be almost rich Would that help to break the ties of love and friendship between the girls Not that Dorothy could ever change in her sincere love for Tavia but might not circumstances separate them and then Tavia had been first to congratulate Dorothy on the good news and the smashed hat had furnished an incident sufficiently distracting to keep Tavia from the lamentations that at first filled her heart Hence it has been necessary to take the reader through her sentiments in a very much less interesting way than Tavia herself would have disclosed them She had a way of saying and doing things that was inimitable and amusing if not entirely elevating Then you think you will stay in Dalton asked Tavia finally as Dorothy succeeded in pulling the smashed hat back into some kind of shape if not the right kind Why not asked Dorothy Are there not plenty of good people in Dalton Oh a few perhaps There s me and Johnnie but we are not out yet and you will be looking for society friends Well here s good luck to you with your Indian millions and don t forget that in your poorest days I used to lend you chewing gum and at this Tavia threw her arms around Dorothy in a warm embrace as if striving to hold to her heart and keep in her life the same old darling Dorothy in spite of the new circumstances Say Sis exclaimed Dorothy Do you realize that this is the very day you are to go for an automobile ride with Nat White And that you are to go in the same machine with Ned White Course I do you selfish girl So taken up with common money that you never noticed my get up Look at this and Tavia drew from the folds of her skirt a cloud of something Automobile veil she explained giving the flimsy stuff a turn that sent it floating through the air like a cloud of smoke Splendid declared Dorothy Gloriotious remarked Tavia the real thing I found it in an old trunk among dear old grandma Travers things and grandma loved it dearly I persuaded mother to let me inherit it and smell putting the gray cloud of silk to Dorothy s face that perfume is lavender Grandma always used it What a dear old lady she must have been said Dorothy looking over the dainty article critically You are not really going to wear it she faltered realizing the value of such an heirloom No I am not but you are There Doro darling it is a gift for you from me You will always keep it and love it Indeed I will do no such thing as to take your dear grandma s things You must always keep this yourself But I want you to Doro It will make me happy to know I have given you something good something I have loved and something you will love for me There and she put the scarf over Dorothy s blond head you look like an angel Grandma herself will be proud all the way from heaven to see this fall upon the shoulders of one so worthy in face and in heart and the two stood there clasped in each other s arms the silvery veil of love falling about the shoulders
