I am not aware of all the circumstances which led to the relinquishment of the Lille plan Brussels had had from the first a strong attraction for Charlotte and the idea of going there in preference to any other place had only been given up in consequence of the information received of the second rate character of its schools In one of her letters reference has been made to Mrs Jenkins the wife of the chaplain of the British Embassy At the request of his brother a clergyman living not many miles from Haworth and an acquaintance of Mr Bront s she made much inquiry and at length after some discouragement in her search heard of a school which seemed in every respect desirable There was an English lady who had long lived in the Orleans family amidst the various fluctuations of their fortunes and who when the Princess Louise was married to King Leopold accompanied her to Brussels in the capacity of reader This lady s granddaughter was receiving her education at the pensionnat of Madame H ger and so satisfied was the grandmother with the kind of instruction given that she named the establishment with high encomiums to Mrs Jerkins and in consequence it was decided that if the terms suited Miss Bront and Emily should proceed thither M H ger informs me that on receipt of a letter from Charlotte making very particular inquiries as to the possible amount of what are usually termed extras he and his wife were so much struck by the simple earnest tone of the letter that they said to each other These are the daughters of an English pastor of moderate means anxious to learn with an ulterior view of instructing others and to whom the risk of additional expense is of great consequence Let us name a specific sum within which all expenses shall be included This was accordingly done the agreement was concluded and the Bront s prepared to leave their native county for the first time if we except the melancholy and memorable residence at Cowan Bridge Mr Bront determined to accompany his daughters Mary and her brother who were experienced in foreign travelling were also of the party Charlotte first saw London in the day or two they now stopped there and from an expression in one of her subsequent letters they all I believe stayed at the Chapter Coffee House Paternoster Row a strange old fashioned tavern of which I shall have more to say hereafter Mary s account of their journey is thus given In passing through London she seemed to think our business was and ought to be to see all the pictures and statues we could She knew the artists and know where other productions of theirs were to be found I don t remember what we saw except St Paul s Emily was like her in these habits of mind but certainly never took her opinion but always had one to offer I don t know what Charlotte thought of Brussels We arrived in the dark and went next morning to our respective schools to see them We were of course much preoccupied and our prospects gloomy Charlotte used to like the country round Brussels At the top of every hill you see something She took long solitary walks on the occasional holidays Mr Bront took his daughters to the Rue d Isabelle Brussels remained one night at Mr Jenkins and straight returned to his wild Yorkshire village What a contrast to that must the Belgian capital have presented to those two young women thus left behind Suffering acutely from every strange and unaccustomed contact far away from their beloved home and the dear moors beyond their indomitable will was their great support Charlotte s own words with regard to Emily are After the age of twenty having meantime studied alone with diligence and perseverance she went with me to an establishment on the continent The same suffering and conflict ensued heightened by the strong recoil of her upright heretic and English spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and Romish system Once more she seemed sinking but this time she rallied through the mere force of resolution with inward remorse and shame she looked back on her former failure and resolved to conquer but the victory cost her dear She was never happy till she carried her hard won knowledge back to the remote English village the old parsonage house and desolate Yorkshire hills They wanted learning They came for learning They would learn Where they had a distinct purpose to be achieved in intercourse with their fellows they forgot themselves at all other times they were miserably shy Mrs Jenkins told me that she used to ask them to spend Sundays and holidays with her until she found that they felt more pain than pleasure from such visits Emily hardly ever uttered more than a monosyllable Charlotte was sometimes excited sufficiently to speak eloquently and well on certain subjects but before her tongue was thus loosened she had a habit of gradually wheeling round on her chair so as almost to conceal her face from the person to whom she was speaking And yet there was much in Brussels to strike a responsive chord in her powerful imagination At length she was seeing somewhat of that grand old world of which she had dreamed As the gay crowds passed by her so had gay crowds paced those streets for centuries in all their varying costumes Every spot told an historic tale extending back into the fabulous ages when Jan and Jannika the aboriginal giant and giantess looked over the wall forty feet high of what is now the Rue Villa Hermosa and peered down upon the new settlers who were to turn them out of the country in which they had lived since the deluge The great solemn Cathedral of St Gudule the religious paintings the striking forms and ceremonies of the Romish Church all made a deep impression on the girls fresh from the bare walls and simple worship of Haworth Church And then they were indignant with themselves for having been susceptible of this impression and their stout Protestant hearts arrayed themselves against the false Duessa that had thus imposed upon them The very building they occupied as pupils in Madame H ger s pensionnat had its own ghostly train of splendid associations marching for ever in shadowy procession through and through the ancient rooms and shaded alleys of the gardens From the splendour of to day in the Rue Royale if you turn aside near the statue of the General Beliard you look down four flights of broad stone steps upon the Rue d Isabelle The chimneys of the houses in it are below your feet Opposite to the lowest flight of steps there is a large old mansion facing you with a spacious walled garden behind and to the right of it In front of this garden on the same side as the mansion and with great boughs of trees sweeping over their lowly roofs is a row of small picturesque old fashioned cottages not unlike in degree and uniformity to the almshouses so often seen in an English country town The Rue d Isabelle looks as though it had been untouched by the innovations of the builder for the last three centuries and yet any one might drop a stone into it from the back windows of the grand modern hotels in the Rue Royale built and furnished in the newest Parisian fashion In the thirteenth century the Rue d Isabelle was called the Foss aux Chiens and the kennels for the ducal hounds occupied the place where Madame H ger s pensionnat now stands A hospital in the ancient large meaning of the word succeeded to the kennel The houseless and the poor perhaps the leprous were received by the brethren of a religious order in a building on this sheltered site and what had been a fosse for defence was filled up with herb gardens and orchards for upwards of a hundred years Then came the aristocratic guild of the cross bow men that company the members whereof were required to prove their noble descent untainted for so many generations before they could be admitted into the guild and being admitted were required to swear a solemn oath that no other pastime or exercise should take up any part of their leisure the whole of which was to be devoted to the practice of the noble art of shooting with the cross bow Once a year a grand match was held under the patronage of some saint to whose church steeple was affixed the bird or semblance of a bird to be hit by the victor The conqueror in the game was Roi des Arbal triers for the coming year and received a jewelled decoration accordingly which he was entitled to wear for twelve months after which he restored it to the guild to be again striven for The family of him who died during the year that he was king were bound to present the decoration to the church of the patron saint of the guild and to furnish a similar prize to be contended for afresh These noble cross bow men of the middle ages formed a sort of armed guard to the powers in existence and almost invariably took the aristocratic in preference to the democratic side in the numerous civil dissensions of the Flemish towns Hence they were protected by the authorities and easily obtained favourable and sheltered sites for their exercise ground And thus they came to occupy the old fosse and took possession of the great orchard of the hospital lying tranquil and sunny in the hollow below the rampart But in the sixteenth century it became necessary to construct a street through the exercise ground of the Arbal triers du Grand Serment and after much delay the company were induced by the beloved Infanta Isabella to give up the requisite plot of ground In recompense for this Isabella who herself was a member of the guild and had even shot down the bird and been queen in made many presents to the arbal triers and in return the grateful city which had long wanted a nearer road to St Gudule but been baffled by the noble archers called the street after her name She as a sort of indemnification to the arbal triers caused a great mansion to be built for their accommodation in the new Rue d Isabelle This mansion was placed in front of their exercise ground and was of a square shape On a remote part of the walls may still be read PHILLIPPO IIII HISPAN REGE ISABELLA CLARA EUGENIA HISPAN INFANS MAGN GULD REGINA GULD FRATRIBUS POSUIT In that mansion were held all the splendid feasts of the Grand Serment des Arbal triers The master archer lived there constantly in order to be ever at hand to render his services to the guild The great saloon was also used for the court balls and festivals when the archers were not admitted The Infanta caused other and smaller houses to be built in her new street to serve as residences for her garde noble and for her garde bourgeoise a small habitation each some of which still remain to remind us of English almshouses The great mansion with its quadrangular form the spacious saloon once used for the archducal balls where the dark grave Spaniards mixed with the blond nobility of Brabant and Flanders now a schoolroom for Belgian girls the cross bow men s archery ground all are there the pensionnat of Madame H ger This lady was assisted in the work of instruction by her husband a kindly wise good and religious man whose acquaintance I am glad to have made and who has furnished me with some interesting details from his wife s recollections and his own of the two Miss Bront s during their residence in Brussels He had the better opportunities of watching them from his giving lessons in the French language and literature in the school A short extract from a letter written to me by a French lady resident in Brussels and well qualified to judge will help to show the estimation in which he is held Je ne connais pas personnellement M H ger mais je sais qu il est peu de caract res aussi nobles aussi admirables que le sien Il est un des membres les plus z l s de cette Soci t de S Vincent de Paul dont je t ai d j parl et ne se contente pas de servir les pauvres et les malades mais leur consacre encore les soir es Apr s des journ es absorb es tout enti res par les devoirs que sa place lui impose il r unit les pauvres les ouvriers leur donne des cours gratuits et trouve encore le moyen de les amuser en les instruisant Ce d vouement te dira assez que M H ger est profondement et ouvertement religieux Il a des mani res franches et avenantes il se fait aimer de tous ceux qui l approchent et surtout des enfants Il a la parole facile et possde un haut degr l loquence du bon sens et du coeur Il n est point auteur Homme de z le et de conscience il vient de se d mettre des fonctions lev es et lucratives qu il exer ait l Ath n e celles de Pr fet des Etudes parce qu il ne peut y r aliser le bien qu il avait esp r introduire l enseignement religieux dans le programme des tudes J ai vu une fois Madame H ger qui a quelque chose de froid et de compass dans son maintien et qui pr vient peu en sa faveur Je la crois pourtant aim e et appr ci e par ses l ves There were from eighty to a hundred pupils in the pensionnat when Charlotte and Emily Bront entered in February M H ger s account is that they knew nothing of French I suspect they knew as much or as little for all conversational purposes as any English girls do who have never been abroad and have only learnt the idioms and pronunciation from an Englishwoman The two sisters clung together and kept apart from the herd of happy boisterous well befriended Belgian girls who in their turn thought the new English pupils wild and scared looking with strange odd insular ideas about dress for Emily had taken a fancy to the fashion ugly and preposterous even during its reign of gigot sleves and persisted in wearing them long after they were gone out Her petticoats too had not a curve or a wave in them but hung down straight and long clinging to her lank figure The sisters spoke to no one but from necessity They were too full of earnest thought and of the exile s sick yearning to be ready for careless conversation or merry game M H ger who had done little but observe during the few first weeks of their residence in the Rue d Isabelle perceived that with their unusual characters and extraordinary talents a different mode must be adopted from that in which he generally taught French to English girls He seems to have rated Emily s genius as something even higher than Charlotte s and her estimation of their relative powers was the same Emily had a head for logic and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rare indeed in a woman according to M H ger Impairing the force of this gift was a stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes or her own sense of right was concerned She should have been a man a great navigator said M H ger in speaking of her Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty never have given way but with life And yet moreover her faculty of imagination was such that if she had written a history her view of scenes and characters would have been so vivid and so powerfully expressed and supported by such a show of argument that it would have dominated over the reader whatever might have been his previous opinions or his cooler perceptions of its truth But she appeared egotistical and exacting compared to Charlotte who was always unselfish this is M H ger s testimony and in the anxiety of the elder to make her younger sister contented she allowed her to exercise a kind of unconscious tyranny over her After consulting with his wife M H ger told them that he meant to dispense with the old method of grounding in grammar vocabulary c and to proceed on a new plan something similar to what he had occasionally adopted with the elder among his French and Belgian pupils He proposed to read to them some of the master pieces of the most celebrated French authors such as Casimir de la Vigne s poem on the Death of Joan of Arc parts of Bossuet the admirable translation of the noble letter of St Ignatius to the Roman Christians in the Biblioth que Choisie des P res de l Eglise c and after having thus impressed the complete effect of the whole to analyse the parts with them pointing out in what such or such an author excelled and where were the blemishes He believed that he had to do with pupils capable from their ready sympathy with the intellectual the refined the polished or the noble of catching the echo of a style and so reproducing their own thoughts in a somewhat similar manner After explaining his plan to them he awaited their reply Emily spoke first and said that she saw no good to be derived from it and that by adopting it they should lose all originality of thought and expression She would have entered into an argument on the subject but for this M H ger had no time Charlotte then spoke she also doubted the success of the plan but she would follow out M H ger s advice because she was bound to obey him while she was his pupil Before speaking of the results it may be desirable to give an extract from one of her letters which shows some of her first impressions of her new life Brussels May I was twenty six years old a week or two since and at this ripe time of life I am a school girl and on the whole very happy in that capacity It felt very strange at first to submit to authority instead of exercising it to obey orders instead of giving them but I like that state of things I returned to it with the same avidity that a cow that has long been kept on dry hay returns to fresh grass Don t laugh at my simile It is natural to me to submit and very unnatural to command This is a large school in which there are about forty externes or day pupils and twelve pensionnaires or boarders Madame H ger the head is a lady of precisely the same cast of mind degree of cultivation and quality of intellect as Miss I think the severe points are a little softened because she has not been disappointed and consequently soured In a word she is a married instead of a maiden lady There are three teachers in the school Mademoiselle Blanche Mademoiselle Sophie and Mademoiselle Marie The two first have no particular character One is an old maid and the other will be one Mademoiselle Marie is talented and original but of repulsive and arbitrary manners which have made the whole school except myself and Emily her bitter enemies No less than seven masters attend to teach the different branches of education French Drawing Music Singing Writing Arithmetic and German All in the house are Catholics except ourselves one other girl and the gouvernante of Madame s children an Englishwoman in rank something between a lady s maid and a nursery governess The difference in country and religion makes a broad line of demarcation between us and all the rest We are completely isolated in the midst of numbers Yet I think I am never unhappy my present life is so delightful so congenial to my own nature compared to that of a governess My time constantly occupied passes too rapidly Hitherto both Emily and I have had good health and therefore we have been able to work well There is one individual of whom I have not yet spoken M H ger the husband of Madame He is professor of rhetoric a man of power as to mind but very choleric and irritable in temperament He is very angry with me just at present because I have written a translation which he chose to stigmatize as peu correct He did not tell me so but wrote the word on the margin of my book and asked in brief stern phrase how it happened that my compositions were always better than my translations adding that the thing seemed to him inexplicable The fact is some weeks ago in a high flown humour he forbade me to use either dictionary or grammar in translating the most difficult English compositions into French This makes the task rather arduous and compels me every now and then to introduce an English word which nearly plucks the eyes out of his head when he sees it Emily and he don t draw well together at all Emily works like a horse and she has had great difficulties to contend with far greater than I have had Indeed those who come to a French school for instruction ought previously to have acquired a considerable knowledge of the French language otherwise they will lose a great deal of time for the course of instruction is adapted to natives and not to foreigners and in these large establishments they will not change their ordinary course for one or two strangers The few private lessons that M H ger has vouchsafed to give us are I suppose to be considered a great favour and I can perceive they have already excited much spite and jealousy in the school You will abuse this letter for being short and dreary and there are a hundred things which I want to tell you but I have not time Brussels is a beautiful city The Belgians hate the English Their external morality is more rigid than ours To lace the stays without a handkerchief on the neck is considered a disgusting piece of indelicacy The passage in this letter where M H ger is represented as prohibiting the use of dictionary or grammar refers I imagine to the time I have mentioned when he determined to adopt a new method of instruction in the French language of which they were to catch the spirit and rhythm rather from the ear and the heart as its noblest accents fell upon them than by over careful and anxious study of its grammatical rules It seems to me a daring experiment on the part of their teacher but doubtless he knew his ground and that it answered is evident in the composition of some of Charlotte s devoirs written about this time I am tempted in illustration of this season of mental culture to recur to a conversation which I had with M H ger on the manner in which he formed his pupils style and to give a proof of his success by copying a devoir of Charlotte s with his remarks upon it He told me that one day this summer when the Bront s had been for about four months receiving instruction from him he read to them Victor Hugo s celebrated portrait of Mirabeau mais dans ma le on je me bornais ce qui concerne Mirabeau orateur C est apr s l analyse de ce morceau consid r surtout du point de vue du fond de la disposition de ce qu on pourrait appeler la charpente qu ont t faits les deux portraits que je vous donne He went on to say that he had pointed out to them the fault in Victor Hugo s style as being exaggeration in conception and at the same time he had made them notice the extreme beauty of his nuances of expression They were then dismissed to choose the subject of a similar kind of portrait This selection M H ger always left to them for it is necessary he observed before sitting down to write on a subject to have thoughts and feelings about it I cannot tell on what subject your heart and mind have been excited I must leave that to you The marginal comments I need hardly say are M H ger s the words in italics are Charlotte s for which he substitutes a better form of expression which is placed between brackets IMITATION Le Juillet PORTRAIT DE PIERRE L HERMITE CHARLOTTE BRONT De

d cid e ce soir Pierre a promis et les Crois s se fient sa parole comme les Isra lites se fiaient celle de Mo se et de Josu As a companion portrait to this Emily chose to depict Harold on the eve of the battle of Hastings It appears to me that her devoir is superior to Charlotte s in power and in imagination and fully equal to it in language and that this in both cases considering how little practical knowledge of French they had when they arrived at Brussels in February and that they wrote without the aid of dictionary or grammar is unusual and remarkable We shall see the progress Charlotte had made in ease and grace of style a year later In the choice of subjects left to her selection she frequently took characters and scenes from the Old Testament with which all her writings show that she was especially familiar The picturesqueness and colour if I may so express it the grandeur and breadth of its narrations impressed her deeply To use M H ger s expression Elle tait nourrie de la Bible After he had read De la Vigne s poem on Joan of Arc she chose the Vision and Death of Moses on Mount Nebo to write about and in looking over this devoir I was much struck with one or two of M H ger s remarks After describing in a quiet and simple manner the circumstances under which Moses took leave of the Israelites her imagination becomes warmed and she launches out into a noble strain depicting the glorious futurity of the Chosen People as looking down upon the Promised Land he sees their prosperity in prophetic vision But before reaching the middle of this glowing description she interrupts herself to discuss for a moment the doubts that have been thrown on the miraculous relations of the Old Testament M H ger remarks When you are writing place your argument first in cool prosaic language but when you have thrown the reins on the neck of your imagination do not pull her up to reason Again in the vision of Moses he sees the maidens leading forth their flocks to the wells at eventide and they are described as wearing flowery garlands Here the writer is reminded of the necessity of preserving a certain verisimilitude Moses might from his elevation see mountains and plains groups of maidens and herds of cattle but could hardly perceive the details of dress or the ornaments of the head When they had made further progress M H ger took up a more advanced plan that of synthetical teaching He would read to them various accounts of the same person or event and make them notice the points of agreement and disagreement Where they were different he would make them seek the origin of that difference by causing them to examine well into the character and position of each separate writer and how they would be likely to affect his conception of truth For instance take Cromwell He would read Bossuet s description of him in the Oraison Fun bre de la Reine d Angleterre and show how in this he was considered entirely from the religious point of view as an instrument in the hands of God preordained to His work Then he would make them read Guizot and see how in this view Cromwell was endowed with the utmost power of free will but governed by no higher motive than that of expediency while Carlyle regarded him as a character regulated by a strong and conscientious desire to do the will of the Lord Then he would desire them to remember that the Royalist and Commonwealth men had each their different opinions of the great Protector And from these conflicting characters he would require them to sift and collect the elements of truth and try to unite them into a perfect whole This kind of exercise delighted Charlotte It called into play her powers of analysis which were extraordinary and she very soon excelled in it Wherever the Bront s could be national they were so with the same tenacity of attachment which made them suffer as they did whenever they left Haworth They were Protestant to the backbone in other things beside their religion but pre eminently so in that Touched as Charlotte was by the letter of St Ignatius before alluded to she claimed equal self devotion and from as high a motive for some of the missionaries of the English Church sent out to toil and to perish on the poisonous African coast and wrote as an imitation Lettre d un Missionnaire Sierra L one Afrique Something of her feeling too appears in the following letter Brussels I consider it doubtful whether I shall come home in September or not Madame H ger has made a proposal for both me and Emily to stay another half year offering to dismiss her English master and take me as English teacher also to employ Emily some part of each day in teaching music to a certain number of the pupils For these services we are to be allowed to continue our studies in French and German and to have board c without paying for it no salaries however are offered The proposal is kind and in a great selfish city like Brussels and a great selfish school containing nearly ninety pupils boarders and day pupils included implies a degree of interest which demands gratitude in return I am inclined to accept it What think you I don t deny I sometimes wish to be in England or that I have brief attacks of home sickness but on the whole I have borne a very valiant heart so far and I have been happy in Brussels because I have always been fully occupied with the employments that I like Emily is making rapid progress in French German music and drawing Monsieur and Madame H ger begin to recognise the valuable parts of her character under her singularities If the national character of the Belgians is to be measured by the character of most of the girls is this school it in a character singularly cold selfish animal and inferior They are very mutinous and difficult for the teachers to manage and their principles are rotten to the core We avoid them which it is not difficult to do as we have the brand of Protestantism and Anglicism upon us People talk of the danger which Protestants expose themselves to in going to reside in Catholic countries and thereby running the chance of changing their faith My advice to all Protestants who are tempted to do anything so besotted as turn Catholics is to walk over the sea on to the Continent to attend mass sedulously for a time to note well the mummeries thereof also the idiotic mercenary aspect of all the priests and then if they are still disposed to consider Papistry in any other light than a most feeble childish piece of humbug let them turn Papists at once that s all I consider Methodism Quakerism and the extremes of High and Low Churchism foolish but Roman Catholicism beats them all At the same time allow me to tell you that there are some Catholics who are as good as any Christians can be to whom the Bible is a sealed book and much better than many Protestants When the Bront s first went to Brussels it was with the intention of remaining there for six months or until the grandes vacances began in September The duties of the school were then suspended for six weeks or two months and it seemed a desirable period for their return But the proposal mentioned in the foregoing letter altered their plans Besides they were happy in the feeling that they were making progress in all the knowledge they had so long been yearning to acquire They were happy too in possessing friends whose society had been for years congenial to them and in occasional meetings with these they could have the inexpressible solace to residents in a foreign country and peculiarly such to the Bront s of talking over the intelligence received from their respective homes referring to past or planning for future days Mary and her sister the bright dancing laughing Martha were parlour boarders in an establishment just beyond the barriers of Brussels Again the cousins of these friends were resident in the town and at their house Charlotte and Emily were always welcome though their overpowering shyness prevented their more valuable qualities from being known and generally kept them silent They spent their weekly holiday with this family for many months but at the end of the time Emily was as impenetrable to friendly advances as at the beginning while Charlotte was too physically weak as Mary has expressed it to gather up her forces sufficiently to express any difference or opposition of opinion and had consequently an assenting and deferential manner strangely at variance with what they knew of her remarkable talents and decided character At this house the T s and the Bront s could look forward to meeting each other pretty frequently There was another English family where Charlotte soon became a welcome guest and where I suspect she felt herself more at her ease than either at Mrs Jenkins or the friends whom I have first mentioned An English physician with a large family of daughters went to reside at Brussels for the sake of their education He placed them at Madame H ger s school in July not a month before the beginning of the grandes vacances on August th In order to make the most of their time and become accustomed to the language these English sisters went daily through the holidays to the pensionnat in the Rue d Isabelle Six or eight boarders remained besides the Miss Bront s They were there during the whole time never even having the break to their monotonous life which passing an occasional day with a friend would have afforded them but devoting themselves with indefatigable diligence to the different studies in which they were engaged Their position in the school appeared to these new comers analogous to what is often called that of a parlour boarder They prepared their French drawing German and literature for their various masters and to these occupations Emily added that of music in which she was somewhat of a proficient so much so as to be qualified to give instruction in it to the three younger sisters of my informant The school was divided into three classes In the first were from fifteen to twenty pupils in the second sixty was about the average number all foreigners excepting the two Bront s and one other in the third there were from twenty to thirty pupils The first and second classes occupied a long room divided by a wooden partition in each division were four long ranges of desks and at the end was the estrade or platform for the presiding instructor On the last row in the quietest corner sat Charlotte and Emily side by side so deeply absorbed in their studies as to be insensible to any noise or movement around them The school hours were from nine to twelve the luncheon hour when the boarders and half boarders perhaps two and thirty girls went to the refectoire a room with two long tables having an oil lamp suspended over each to partake of bread and fruit the externes or morning pupils who had brought their own refreshment with them adjourning to eat it in the garden From one to two there was fancy work a pupil reading aloud some light literature in each room from two to four lessons again At four the externes left and the remaining girls dined in the refectoire M and Madame H ger presiding From five to six there was recreation from six to seven preparation for lessons and after that succeeded the lecture pieuse Charlotte s nightmare On rare occasions M H ger himself would come in and substitute a book of a different and more interesting kind At eight there was a slight meal of water and pistolets the delicious little Brussels rolls which was immediately followed by prayers and then to bed The principal bedroom was over the long classe or schoolroom There were six or eight narrow beds on each side of the apartment every one enveloped in its white draping curtain a long drawer beneath each served for a wardrobe and between each was a stand for ewer basin and looking glass The beds of the two Miss Bront s were at the extreme end of the room almost as private and retired as if they had been in a separate apartment During the hours of recreation which were always spent in the garden they invariably walked together and generally kept a profound silence Emily though so much the taller leaning on her sister Charlotte would always answer when spoken to taking the lead in replying to any remark addressed to both Emily rarely spoke to any one Charlotte s quiet gentle manner never changed She was never seen out of temper for a moment and occasionally when she herself had assumed the post of English teacher and the impertinence or inattention of her pupils was most irritating a slight increase of colour a momentary sparkling of the eye and more decided energy of manner were the only outward tokens she gave of being conscious of the annoyance to which she was subjected But this dignified endurance of hers subdued her pupils in the long run far more than the voluble tirades of the other mistresses My informant adds The effect of this manner was singular I can speak from personal experience I was at that time high spirited and impetuous not respecting the French mistresses yet to my own astonishment at one word from her I was perfectly tractable so much so that at length M and Madame H ger invariably preferred all their wishes to me through her the other pupils did not perhaps love her as I did she was so quiet and silent but all respected her With the exception of that part which describes Charlotte s manner as English teacher an office which she did not assume for some months later all this description of the school life of the two Bront s refers to the commencement of the new scholastic year in October and the extracts I have given convey the first impression which the life at a foreign school and the position of the two Miss Bront s therein made upon an intelligent English girl of sixteen I will make a quotation from Mary s letter referring to this time The first part of her time at Brussels was not uninteresting She spoke of new people and characters and foreign ways of the pupils and teachers She knew the hopes and prospects of the teachers and mentioned one who was very anxious to marry she was getting so old She used to get her father or brother I forget which to be the bearer of letters to different single men who she thought might be persuaded to do her the favour saying that her only resource was to become a sister of charity if her present employment failed and that she hated the idea Charlotte naturally looked with curiosity to people of her own condition This woman almost frightened her She declares there is nothing she can turn to and laughs at the idea of delicacy and she is only ten years older than I am I did not see the connection till she said Well Polly I should hate being a sister of charity I suppose that would shock some people but I should I thought she would have as much feeling as a nurse as most people and more than some She said she did not know how people could bear the constant pressure of misery and never to change except to a new form of it It would be impossible to keep one s natural feelings I promised her a better destiny than to go begging any one to marry her or to lose her natural feelings as a sister of charity She said My youth is leaving me I can never do better than I have done and I have done nothing yet At such times she seemed to think that most human beings were destined by the pressure of worldly interests to lose one faculty and feeling after another till they went dead altogether I hope I shall be put in my grave as soon as I m dead I don t want to walk about so Here we always differed I thought the degradation of nature she feared was a consequence of poverty and that she should give her attention to earning money Sometimes she admitted this but could find no means of earning money At others she seemed afraid of letting her thoughts dwell on the subject saying it brought on the worst palsy of all Indeed in her position nothing less than entire constant absorption in petty money matters could have scraped together a provision Of course artists and authors stood high with Charlotte and the best thing after their works would have been their company She used very inconsistently to rail at money and money getting and then wish she was able to visit all the large towns in Europe see all the sights and know all the celebrities This was her notion of literary fame a passport to the society of clever people When she had become acquainted with the people and ways at Brussels her life became monotonous and she fell into the same hopeless state as at Miss W s though in a less degree I wrote to her urging her to go home or elsewhere she had got what she wanted French and there was at least novelty in a new place if no improvement That if she sank into deeper gloom she would soon not have energy to go and she was too far from home for her friends to hear of her condition and order her home as they had done from Miss W s She wrote that I had done her a great service that she should certainly follow my advice and was much obliged to me I have often wondered at this letter Though she patiently tolerated advice she could always quietly put it aside and do as she thought fit More than once afterwards she mentioned the service I had done her She sent me l to New Zealand on hearing some exaggerated accounts of my circumstances and told me she hoped it would come in seasonably it was a debt she owed me for the service I had done her I should think l was a quarter of her income The service was mentioned as an apology but kindness was the real motive The first break in this life of regular duties and employments came heavily and sadly Martha pretty winning mischievous tricksome Martha was taken ill suddenly at the Ch teau de Koekelberg Her sister tended her with devoted love but it was all in vain in a few days she died Charlotte s own short account of this event is as follows Martha T s illness was unknown to me till the day before she died I hastened to Koekelberg the next morning unconscious that she was in great danger and was told that it was finished She had died in the night Mary was taken away to Bruxelles I have seen Mary frequently since She is in no ways crushed by the event but while Martha was ill she was to her more than a mother more than a sister watching nursing cherishing her so tenderly so unweariedly She appears calm and serious now no bursts of violent emotion no exaggeration of distress I have seen Martha s grave the place where her ashes lie in a foreign country Who that has read Shirley does not remember the few lines perhaps half a page of sad recollection He has no idea that little Jessy will die young she is so gay and chattering and arch original even now passionate when provoked but most affectionate if caressed by turns gentle and rattling exacting yet generous fearless yet reliant on any who will help her Jessy with her little piquant face engaging prattle and winning ways is made to be a pet Do you know this place No you never saw it but you recognise the nature of these trees this foliage the cypress the willow the yew Stone crosses like these are not unfamiliar to you nor are these dim garlands of everlasting flowers Here is the place green sod and a grey marble head stone Jessy sleeps below She lived through an April day much loved was she much loving She often in her brief life shed tears she had frequent sorrows she smiled between gladdening whatever saw her Her death was tranquil and happy in Rose s guardian arms for Rose had been her stay and defence through many trials the dying and the watching English girls were at that hour alone in a foreign country and the soil of that country gave Jessy a grave But Jessy I will write about you no more This is an autumn evening wet and wild There is only one cloud in the sky but it curtains it from pole to pole The wind cannot rest it hurries sobbing over hills of sullen outline colourless with twilight and mist Rain has beat all day on that church tower Haworth it rises dark from the stony enclosure of its graveyard the nettles the long grass and the tombs all drip with wet This evening reminds me too forcibly of another evening some years ago a howling rainy autumn evening too when certain who had that day performed a pilgrimage to a grave new made in a heretic cemetery sat near a wood fire on the hearth of a foreign dwelling They were merry and social but they each knew that a gap never to be filled had been made in their circle They knew they had lost something whose absence could never be quite atoned for so long as they lived and they knew that heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth which covered their lost darling and that the sad sighing gale was mourning above her buried head The fire warmed them Life and Friendship yet blessed them but Jessy lay cold coffined solitary only the sod screening her from the storm This was the first death that had occurred in the small circle of Charlotte s immediate and intimate friends since the loss of her two sisters long ago She was still in the midst of her deep sympathy with Mary when word came from home that her aunt Miss Branwell was ailing was very ill Emily and Charlotte immediately resolved to go home straight and hastily packed up for England doubtful whether they should ever return to Brussels or not leaving all their relations with M and Madame H ger and the pensionnat uprooted and uncertain of any future existence Even before their departure on the morning after they received the first intelligence of illness when they were on the very point of starting came a second letter telling them of their aunt s death It could not hasten their movements for every arrangement had been made for speed They sailed from Antwerp they travelled night and day and got home on a Tuesday morning The funeral and all was over and Mr Bront and Anne were sitting together in quiet grief for the loss of one who had done her part well in their household for nearly twenty years and earned the regard and respect of many who never knew how much they should miss her till she was gone The small property which she had accumulated by dint of personal frugality and self denial was bequeathed to her nieces Branwell her darling was to have had his share but his reckless expenditure had distressed the good old lady and his name was omitted in her will When the first shock was over the three sisters began to enjoy the full relish of meeting again after the longest separation they had had in their lives They had much to tell of the past and much to settle for the future Anne had been for some little time in a situation to which she was to return at the end of the Christmas holidays For another year or so they were again to be all three apart and after that the happy vision of being together and opening a school was to be realised Of course they did not now look forward to settling at Burlington or any other place which would take them away from their father but the small sum which they each independently possessed would enable them to effect such alterations in the parsonage house at Haworth as would adapt it to the reception of pupils Anne s plans for the interval were fixed Emily quickly decided to be the daughter to remain at home About Charlotte there was much deliberation and some discussion Even in all the haste of their sudden departure from Brussels M H ger had found time to write a letter of sympathy to Mr Bront on the loss which he had just sustained a letter containing such a graceful appreciation of the daughters characters under the form of a tribute of respect to their father that I should have been tempted to copy it even had there not also been a proposal made in it respecting Charlotte which deserves a place in the record of her life Au R v rend Monsieur Bront Pasteur vang

obvious that a second year of instruction would be far more valuable than the first that there was no long hesitation before it was decided that Charlotte should return to Brussels Meanwhile they enjoyed their Christmas all together inexpressibly Branwell was with them that was always a pleasure at this time whatever might be his faults or even his vices his sisters yet held him up as their family hope as they trusted that he would some day be their family pride They blinded themselves to the magnitude of the failings of which they were now and then told by persuading themselves that
