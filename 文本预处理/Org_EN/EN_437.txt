The sullen listlessness that had hung over the apiary for over a week was gone Bees were at work from every hive coming and going with a swift activity like the days of the willow bloom Hurrah We must put on the supers at once cried Alice I believe we ought to have had them on several days ago Breakfast was hurried through that morning and no dishes were washed up after it They hurried down to the barn to bring up the prepared supers placing one beside each hive so that they could all be put on at once The supers for extracted honey were exactly the same size as the body of the hive itself without either top or bottom and each containing eight ready built frames of comb The cover of the hive is removed and the super set upon it then the cover replaced on the top of the two story edifice Usually a sheet of zinc queen excluder is placed between the two the perforations so accurately made that they will let the workers pass into the upper story while the larger bodied queen cannot get through The lower story is then known as the brood chamber and the ideal condition is for the queen to keep this division constantly full of the cycle of eggs larv and hatching bees while the workers store all the honey in the super convenient for taking off A good deal of comb honey in one pound sections was to be produced also and Alice had already picked out the strongest colonies for this work Section honey is a fancy product and sells at a high price and the apiarists counted on this to pay off the due in August For that reason the comb honey crop was of the most immediate importance though there would be a greater quantity of the extracted honey Naturally bees will store much more honey when built combs are furnished them but the extracted honey sells more slowly and at little more than half the price They had already prepared more than a hundred section supers boxes of the same length and width as the brood chamber but only half the depth each containing thirty two sections with foundation One of these was set accurately on the top of each of the seventy colonies selected to gather the fancy crop The deep extracting supers of built combs were distributed among the rest of the bees Carl and Alice worked hard all that day and for part of the next forenoon putting on the supers The weather was hot and moist splendid honey weather More and more of the pale raspberry blossoms were opening though as yet the honey flow was barely at its start That evening Alice peeped into some of the newly placed supers irresistibly curious to know what the bees had done The supers of combs were full of the insects cleaning out the cells and varnishing them ready for honey storage and here and there was even a glistening patch of fresh honey In the supers of sections no combs were yet built of course but the bees were clustering there in masses and evidently preparing for work in earnest All looked most promising but both she and Carl knew that everything depended on the weather from day to day For the honey flow is the most capricious thing in the world If the weather is too wet the bees cannot work and the honey is washed out of the blossoms If it is too dry the secretion of nectar in the flowers will cease altogether A cold spell too will check the honey flow and high winds will dry it up Often the clouding over of the sky or a shift in the wind will produce a heavy flow or stop one It is regulated by faint differences of temperature and moisture and the ideal weather is warm and damp with if possible a suggestion of thunderstorm in the air In such a day a good colony of bees will often bring in ten pounds or more of honey so that Alice and Carl had figured that every good day would be worth easily a hundred dollars The next morning was warm and the bees worked merrily Now that the honey flow had started they were no longer cross Their owners could walk up and down the rows of hives through the clouds of flying bees that came almost as thick as snowflakes and there was scarcely any danger of being stung Carl was standing in the midst of this activity observing the flight with satisfaction when a volley of bees suddenly poured with a loud roaring from one of the hives nearest him Swarm Alice he yelled It was the first swarm of that season and of course it came from one of the strongest colonies Carl marked the hive that had sent it out and turned his attention to the bees in the air For some seconds the cloud of insects swirled round and round then it drifted slowly toward the cabin Finding no place to alight there it floated irresolutely about in one direction and another and finally moved down toward the river flying about twenty feet from the ground Here it suddenly concentrated by a small cedar tree A few bees settled on the tip of a long branch in a moment there was a brown cluster growing as he looked at it and in five minutes the branch was bending down under the weight of a mass of bees that would nearly have filled a five gallon pail What a tremendously big swarm exclaimed Alice who had come to look at it Did you see the hive they came from Then let s attend to it and then we can hive the swarm When they removed the cover of the hive that had swarmed the super was seen to be nearly empty of bees though it contained a good deal of fresh honey Lifting it off they saw that the brood chamber also appeared sadly depleted Fully two thirds of the bees had gone with the swarm Isn t there any way of keeping them from swarming Alice asked Carl We d get so much more honey if the colonies didn t break in two like this None Alice replied busy with the smoker Except by seeing that they always have plenty of storage room for honey They don t usually swarm till they get crowded This colony was probably feeling crowded before we put the super on it they got the swarming idea fixed and when the honey flow started well away they went Meanwhile Alice was taking out one comb after another glancing at each and replacing it till she came at last to the most marvelous thing in the world of bees the mystery of the queen cells There they were five or six on a single comb great peanut shaped protuberances some sealed with a rounded capping others still open at the tip showing the white young queen within floating in a mass of royal jelly For when the bees become queenless they have the science to rear a new one to save the colony from perishing An ordinary worker egg that is just hatching into the larva is profusely fed with royal jelly that strangely prepared food of which no one knows the exact composition Instead of growing in the ordinary cell the larva is given one of these great waxen cones for its nursery and instead of hatching in twenty one days into a worker bee it hatches in sixteen into a fully fledged virgin queen The first preparation for swarming is the starting of a batch of these queen cells so that the colony shall not be left queenless when the queen departs with the swarm and the swarm does not leave till some of the cells are sealed over Whenever a queen loses her life or grows so old as to be useless the same sort of queen cells are started to replace her The only exception is when a queen dies in the winter and there are no eggs from which a new one can be reared and then unless man gives help the colony quickly vanishes Carl had seen queen cells often enough before but he never ceased to regard them with amazement He peeped into an unsealed cell took out a little of the thick white royal jelly and tasted it on the end of a twig Rich thick sour and sweet all at once he commented It turns a worker into a queen I wonder what it would do to me if I ate a lot of it You d be a king said Alice promptly Put those cells back They ll get chilled And let s go and catch that swarm Carl had a number of hives prepared for such emergencies each with ten new frames of foundation The old hive now out of action they carried away to a new stand and placed the prepared hive where it had stood Upon it they put the partly filled super that the swarm had left Alice now brought out the large water pail from the house and they walked down to where the swarm was settled It still clung there in a big brown murmuring pearl shaped mass There they would probably hang for hours till they had decided in their mysterious councils what hollow tree in the forest they would make for But they were not to leave man s control Carl climbed a little way into the tree then leaning far out slipped the tin pail close under the swarm and shook the branch smartly With a thump the whole mass dropped into the pail not a bee flying They seethed and flowed like molasses while Carl hastily jumped down ran to the hive he had prepared and poured them down at its entrance They began to crawl in at once and among the rest Alice caught sight of the queen just entering the hive with a mass of bees This meant definite possession being taken Immediately the bees spread over the entrance board began to fan The swarm was safely hived A new swarm usually works with great vigor knowing that it has a great deal of time to make up and this one might be expected to finish the super The parent colony was now out of action but it would hatch out a new queen in a week and would build up strong again before fall We must really do something to keep swarming down said Alice anxiously Of course we want to increase our bees but if the colonies break up now it will cut our honey crop in two And we must get the honey Nothing to do then but to go all through them and see if any more are starting queen cells replied Carl It s rather a big job though and I wish Bob were here to help us However it was not necessary to tear all the hives open Some they knew were too weak to think of swarming With others it was sufficient to glance at the entrance and into the super to make sure of the steady contented activity About twenty they went through thoroughly and in five of them they found the beginnings of queen cells an acorn shaped cup with an almost microscopic larv in it surrounded by royal jelly These they tore down at once and marked the hives for close watching in future Next morning they continued this inspection and three swarms came out while they were at work One of them settled in the top of such a high tree that it could not be reached They had to let it stay and late that afternoon it took wing again and made off across the woods out of sight The others they hived successfully and they made all possible haste to look through all the suspicious colonies for signs of swarming Despite all efforts however the bees seemed to be getting ahead of them and they were working frantically when a voice hailed them from the direction of the river Hello busy bees Bob was coming up through the willows from the direction of the river and dropping everything they rushed to meet him in delight and astonishment How in the world did you get here Where s your wagon You didn t walk cried Carl Bob waved his hand triumphantly toward the river He had come from Morton by water in a second hand boat that he had bought cheaply in the village It was not beautiful it was a homemade affair which could be poled paddled or rowed or perhaps sailed too It was old and rough and needed painting badly but it was water tight and had cost only nine dollars Alice was enchanted a boat was what she had been longing for most of all Bob had had rather a hard up stream pull for he brought quite a cargo with him besides his trunk potatoes dried apples prunes butter flour and two more cases of bee supplies And here re your queens he added taking a package from his pocket There were seven mailing cages six tied in one parcel and the other containing the three dollar breeding queen by itself Carl looked through the wire gauze cover at this valuable insect surrounded by her attendants She doesn t look any bigger or better than the rest of them he complained Wait till we see how she performs said Alice hopefully The mailing cages were small hollowed out wooden blocks covered on one side with wire cloth each contained an Italian queen with half a dozen attendant bees that had traveled all the way in the mail bags from Tennessee One small compartment in each cage was filled with soft candy and most of this had been eaten on the journey As these queens had already been too long confined Alice at once made preparations for introducing them a matter of no small difficulty For a colony of bees even if deprived of their queen will not easily accept a strange one They prefer the more lengthy plan of raising a batch of queen cells and will kill any new queen put into the hive Sometimes however they can be thrown into a panic by smoking and beating on the hive and the new queen slipped in while they are too demoralized to notice her The more common plan however is the one that Alice adopted She had already selected seven colonies where the queens appeared to be laying badly and she now searched these queens out and killed them Tearing off a strip of pasteboard on one end of a mailing cage she revealed a small hole plugged with soft honey candy then she pushed the cage into the hive down between the combs The bees would at once eat out the candy thus opening the hole and releasing the queen and the sweet would put them in a good humor so that they would be likely to accept her without trouble All but one of the seven were safely introduced The seventh was found next morning dead in front of the hive where the bees had thrown her body out Luckily it was not the three dollar queen Late that afternoon it rained a little and the next day was hot and muggy It was perhaps the best honey day of the whole season The bees were almost frantic over the abundance of sweet The apiary roared like a huge mill Carl who had gone fishing declared that he could hear it a quarter of a mile away Long after dark the apiary still roared sonorously from every hive where the bees were fanning furiously with their wings driving currents of air between the combs to ripen the fresh honey Bob looked into the supers after flying had ceased and reported that many of the combs were entirely full of sparkling honey clear as water Of course it was still unripe and unsealed and would need the care of the bees for some time before taking on the rich thick consistency of finished honey ready to be sealed For the time being the apiarists had checked the swarming and had a few days of leisure Now and again a swarm did come out despite all precaution but they caught nearly all of these so that there was a fresh row of new colonies being built up Then a succession of chilly days cut the honey flow short The bees turned sulky and cross It was impossible to go among the hives without being stung but after the third day honey began to come in slowly once more Strawberries were now ripe and could be picked in the greatest profusion Alice gathered them daily so did the boys and in fact for a few days they ate hardly anything else Alice longed to make jam but had no jam pots Carl went out one morning to pick berries but returned within an hour looking disturbed In one hand he held his half filled pail and in the other a rusty tin pan What do you think of this Bob he demanded The pan was half full of some dark fluid at which his brother sniffed carefully Maple syrup he pronounced Yes and something else See that green sediment That s Paris green I found the pan under the bushes just beyond the hives Poison cried Alice Why it must have been meant to kill the bees I guess Mr Larue was trying to get revenge for his sore leg said Carl grimly This must have been laid some days ago for there s rainwater in it Luckily the bees won t touch any other sweet when they re getting honey In his first wrath Bob declared that he would take his gun go down to the squatter s cabin and accuse him of the trick but their calmer judgment decided that it was best to let the matter pass unnoticed So it would probably have passed but for a chance encounter of Carl s a few days later He was going through the woods with his shotgun and came upon a trout brook about a mile from the cabin a stream well known to him though he seldom fished there He was quietly following up the bank when he perceived Larue a few yards in front of him The squatter was smoking a clay pipe and angling industriously with a short rod A double barrelled shotgun stood against a tree behind him They sighted each other almost simultaneously and for a moment stared at one another in surprise and distrust W at you want said the half breed You try to creep up on me eh I didn t know you were here said Carl But look here you d better not try to kill any more of our bees Keel your bees Don t know w at you mean Yes you do I found the poison you put out You could be arrested for that You have me arrest Why I keel you first cried Larue Don t try it And you keep away from our camp in future When we hear anything after dark we re as likely as not to shoot Carl held his gun ready for he half expected Larue to attack him But the squatter did not reach for his weapon he only assailed Carl with such abuse in mixed French and English that the boy almost lost his temper He half raised his gun and then as good sense came back to him lowered it quickly We don t want any trouble with you he said trying to speak coolly If we do have any it ll be your own fault But you keep away from our place Now I ve warned you He stepped back into the cedars and walked away his ears alert for any suspicious sound behind him But as he cooled down he felt that he had acted most injudiciously and he felt in fact so annoyed with himself that he determined not to mention the matter when he got home It took him some time however to calm his irritation to this extent and meanwhile he walked rapidly and rather aimlessly through the woods toward the northwest He was thinking of anything but his directions when he came upon the remains of an old road probably a disused timber road that might lead to Morton Following this for a couple of hundred yards he came in sight of a little lake that he had never seen before It was about two miles wide and contained one small rocky islet Fire and storm seemed to have swept the shores for they were covered for more than a hundred yards from the water with tangled dead wood ricks of underbrush sprouting second growths and raspberry canes everywhere In fact there seemed to be square miles of wild raspberry around the lake It was covered with bloom but not a bee did he see There was no necessity for their bees to travel so far as this to find all the raspberry bloom they wanted What a magnificent spot for an apiary Carl reflected as he gazed about him In addition to the raspberries Carl noticed on a little rise of ground near him a whole grove of large basswood trees It was too early for their bloom but he was going over to inspect them when something seemed to strike him heavily on the head The boy dropped in his tracks and probably for several minutes he lay unconscious He came to himself feeling dazed and sick with a dim idea that some one had clubbed him His mind turned to Larue as he got weakly to his feet but no one was anywhere in sight His hat lay on the ground He recovered it and was startled to see two small holes through the crown At the same time he became aware that blood was running down his forehead It flashed upon him that he had been shot and shot through the head He turned sick and faint at the idea and wondered how he came to be still alive He hardly dared to put his hand to his head fearing to find a gaping cavity but he could not feel exactly what he could call a wound though there was a very sore spot on the top of his skull He raked away a good deal of loose hair and blood was trickling down freely He was somewhat reassured at finding the wound was not going to be immediately fatal Looking at the holes in his hat he saw that they must have been made by a small caliber high powered rifle bullet and this exonerated Larue for it was a shotgun that the squatter had been carrying Carl had heard no report very likely the shot had been fired by some sportsman at a mile distance perhaps on the other side of the lake Missing its proper mark the bullet had driven on till Carl had had the misfortune to come in its way He made his way down to the lake and contrived a cold compress on his head with his handkerchief and began to think of making his way home He was so dazed still that he entirely forgot the old lumber road by which he had come in and started through the woods in what seemed to be the direction of the cabin He felt very weak and sick when he attempted to walk but he kept going for a long time till he came out upon a wide half burned strip choked with wild raspberry vines A rapid shallow brook hurried down the middle of the opening He had never seen this place before that he could remember and suddenly it seemed to him that all his directions had gone suddenly wrong He had not the slightest idea in which direction the cabin lay At this moment it occurred to him that he had a pocket compass He consulted it tried to think out his position but his head ached too violently for any mental effort However he set out again in a new direction and after half an hour s unsteady walking came into another raspberry slash which he presently recognized as the same one he had passed before At this new horror added to his pain and weakness his strength failed entirely He fell among the flowering canes and lay there for a long time partly in a sort of stupor partly in dull anger against the stupid recklessness of men who go into the woods with rifles having an effective range of two miles He was parched with thirst and fever but could hardly summon energy enough to crawl down to the stream Finally he accomplished it drank and dipped his head in the water and felt refreshed He was able to think more clearly He had his compass he knew the directions but he could form no sort of idea whether the cabin lay north south east or west He could not remember definitely in which direction he had traveled after meeting Larue and his wanderings since that time had completely confused him As he lay there he heard the murmur of bees among the raspberry blossoms They were probably his own bees he reflected dimly and he envied them their wings and their instinct that led them straight home across the forest And then it struck him that he could not possibly be more than two miles from home or the bees would not be working there in such numbers He thought he saw a chance of help A laden bee flies home in a proverbially straight line He watched the insects as they crawled over the blossoms and finally rose laden into the air They circled rising in spirals and then darted across the open space and over the tree tops It was easy to follow the black specks for some distance against the blue sky Carl sighted their course carefully with the compass took another drink at the stream and set off on their trail It was a painful tramp His head ached excruciatingly and when by accident he tripped or stumbled the jar left him weak almost to fainting A dozen times he sat down to rest and almost despaired of getting anywhere It seemed to him that he had walked miles when he came to another raspberry thicket and here he found the guiding bees again Again he sighted their course and they took the same homeward direction as the first had done Clearly he was on the right track and somewhat encouraged he forced himself ahead again But in less than fifteen minutes he came out upon the shore of a rapid river Here was an obstacle The stream was fully sixty feet wide and looked deep Carl wondered how so large a river had existed in the neighborhood without their having seen it and began to have doubts as to his course after all Perhaps these were merely wild bees from some hollow tree However he was determined to follow them home They were crossing the river and he would have to cross it He picked up a long dry cedar pole for a float in case he went out of his depth and waded in Halfway across he stepped into a deep hole and was immediately carried off his feet by the force of the current Then he had reason to bless his pole for it saved him from drowning though he was rolled over and over and half choked He managed to recover his footing and scrambled ashore but on the same side of the river as before He was more dazed than ever by the ducking and he started down the bank to look for a better place to cross Bees were going over his head in great numbers The roar was tremendous and now he noticed that they were crossing the river in both directions coming and going Perhaps he thought he was on the right side after all and he stumbled on for another hundred yards He encountered a beaten path followed it and the woods opened into a clearing All at once the noise of the bees rose prodigiously and like a flash the whole landscape turned familiar It was home He saw the roof of the cabin The bees had led him straight after all His strength almost failed him in this last lap but Bob saw him coming and rushed anxiously to meet him What s the matter he cried as he ran up I ve been shot Carl muttered Plumb through the head And then he collapsed so that Bob had to call Alice for help and carry him into the house He recovered when they were sponging his head and cutting away the hair to get at his wound The blood had caked and had stopped its bleeding It must have looked gruesome for he heard Alice and Bob discussing how they could get a doctor I don t know that it s so bad after all said Bob after more of Carl s crown had been washed clean and after a little more examination he began to laugh Get up he said You re not hurt It s only a graze hardly deep enough to draw blood Carl looked astonished and foolish Alice who had been pale but collected gave Bob a reproachful look sat down suddenly and began to cry a little Just a little m more though and he would have been k killed she stammered Yes said Bob more seriously half an inch lower and that bullet might have done for you How did it happen Who could have shot at you Carl gave an account of his adventure As soon as he learned that his deadly wound was only a scratch he felt remarkably better A good part of his collapse must have been due to pure mental effect But it was not all imaginary the graze of a high powered bullet upon the top of the head was stunning enough and when he tried to get up he found himself still weak and staggery But I ve found a superb place for another bee yard he told them I don t think it s more than three miles from here and there s enough raspberry and basswood there for the bees to work themselves to death It would be a gold mine to us
