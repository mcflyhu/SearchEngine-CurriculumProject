A few nights after this there was a full moon Dominick walking home from the bank saw it at the end of the street s vista a large yellowish pink disk floating up into the twilight The air about it was suffused with a misty radiance and its wide glowing face having a thin look like a transparency of paper with a light behind it seemed though not yet clear of the housetops already to dominate the sky The evening was warm like the early summer in other climates and Dominick walking slowly and watching the great yellow sphere deepening in color as it swam majestically upward thought of evenings like this in the past when he had been full of the joy of life and had gone forth in the spirit of love and adventure The sight of his home dispelled these memories and brought upon him the sense of his daily environment and its distastefulness The determination to accept his fate which had been with him on his return from Antelope had of late been[ ] shaken by stirrings of rebellion Uplifted by the thought of his love for a woman hopelessly removed from him but who would always be a lodestar to worship reverently and to guide him up difficult paths he had been able to face his domestic tragedy with the high resolution of the martyr But this exalted condition was hard to maintain in the friction of daily life with Berny Before she had merely been a disagreeable companion of whom he had to make the best Now she was that intensified by a comparison which threw out her every fault and petty vulgarity into glaring prominence And more than that she was the angel with the flaming sword the self incurred invited domesticated angel the angel come to stay who barred the way to Paradise She seemed to him to have changed within the last week When he had first come home from Antelope she had been Berny in one of her less familiar but recognizable moods Berny trying to be agreeable wearing her best clothes every day ordering the things for dinner he liked talking loudly and incessantly Then quite suddenly he became aware of a change in her She grew silent absent minded morose He had tried to make their lives easier by always being polite and carefully considerate of her and she had responded to it For the last few days she had made no effort to assist him in this laudable[ ] design Instead she had been unresponsive preoccupied uninvitingly snappish in her replies Several times he had been forced into the novel position of making conversation throughout dinner exerting his wits for subjects to talk about that he might lift the gloom and elicit some response from the mute scowling woman opposite To night the period of ill humor seemed over Berny was not only once again her animated self she was almost feverishly garrulous Dinner had not progressed past the fish when she began to question him on his recent experiences at Antelope The subject had come up several times since his return but for the last few days he had had a respite from it and hoped its interest had worn away She had many queries to make about Bill Cannon and from the father it was but a natural transition to the daughter so much the more attractive of the pair Dominick was soon inwardly writhing under an exceedingly ingenious and searching catechism Had he been less preoccupied by his own acute discomfort he might have noticed that Berny herself gave evidence of disturbance As she prodded him with her questions her face was suffused with unusual color and the eagerness of her curiosity shone through the carelessness with which she sought to veil it Certain queries she accompanied with a piercing glance of investigation watching with hungry sharpness the[ ] countenance of the persecuted man Fearful of angering her or still worse of arousing her suspicions Dominick bore the examination with all the fortitude he had but he rose from the table with every nerve tingling rasped and galled to the limit of endurance He did not come into the den immediately but roamed about into the parlor down the passage and into his own room He spread the scent of his cigar and its accompanying films of smoke all through the flat a thing that Berny would never have ordinarily allowed To night she was too occupied in listening to his prowling steps to bother about minor rules and regulations She saw in his restlessness a disturbance evoked by her questionings Aren t you coming into the den she called as she heard him pacing steadily along the passageway No he called back The moonlight s shining in at every window It makes me restless I don t feel like sitting still She sat on the divan a paper spread before her face but her eyes were slanted sidewise unblinking in the absorption of her attention Suddenly she heard a rattling sound which she knew to be from the canes and umbrellas in the hat rack She cast away the paper and drawing herself to the edge of the divan peered down the passage Dominick was standing by the hat rack his hat[ ] on the back of his head his hand feeling among the canes You ve got your hat on she called in a high key of surprise You re not going out Yes I am he answered drawing out the cane he wanted It s a fine night and I m going for a walk For a walk there was hesitancy in her tone and for a horrible moment he thought she was going to suggest coming with him Where are you going to Oh I don t know just prowl about I want some exercise Are you going to your mother s she ventured not without some timidity No he said I m not going anywhere in particular Good night She sat forward listening to his descending feet and the bang of the hall door A glance at the window showed her it was as he said a fine night deluged with the radiance of the moon Probably he was just going out for a walk and not to see anybody He was always doing queer things like that But Berny sat staring in front of her biting her nails and thinking Uneasiness had been planted in her by Dominick s flight to Antelope More poignant uneasiness had followed that first attack Now the bitter corrosive of jealousy began to grow and expand in her Sitting huddled on the divan she thought of[ ] Dominick walking through the moonlight to Rose Cannon and another new and griping pang laid hold upon her Outside Dominick walked slowly keeping to the smaller and less frequented streets It was a wonderful night as still as though the moon had exerted some mesmeric influence upon the earth Everything was held motionless and without sound in a trance like quietude In the gardens not a blossom stirred Where leaves extended from undefined darknesses of foliage they stood out stem and fiber with a carven distinctness their shadows painted on the asphalt walks in inky silhouette There was no lamplight to warm the clear still pallor of the street s vista It stretched between the fronts of houses a river of light white and mysterious like a path in a dream It was a night for lovers for trysts and for whispered vows Dominick walked slowly feeling himself an outsider in its passionate enchantment The scents that the gardens gave out and through which he passed as through zones of sweetness were part of it So were the sounds that rose from the blotted vagueness of white figures on a porch from impenetrable depths of shadow laughter low voices little cries In the distance people were singing snatches of a song that rose and fell breaking out suddenly and as suddenly dropping into silence [ ]His course was not aimless and took him by a slow upward ascent to that high point of the city whence the watcher can look down on the bay the rugged engirdling hills and the hollow of North Beach Here he stood resting on his cane and gazing on the far flung panorama with the white moon sailing high and its reflection glittering across the water Along the bases of the hills the clotted lights of little towns shone in faintly glimmering agglomerations At his feet the hollow lay like a black hole specked with hundreds of sparks Each spark was the light of a home symbol of the fire of a hearth He stood looking down on them thinking of what they represented that cherished center round which a man s life revolves and which he by his own sin and folly had lost for ever He walked on skirting the hollow and moving forward through streets where old houses brooded in overgrown gardens The thin music of strings rose on the night and two men passed him playing on the mandolin and guitar They walked with quick elastic steps their playing accurately in accord their bodies swaying slightly to its rhythm They swung by him and the vibrating harmonies that sounded so frail and attenuated in the suave largeness of the night grew faint and fainter as if weighed upon and gradually extinguished by the dense saturation of the moonlight Music was evidently a mode of expression that[ ] found favor on this evening of still brilliance A few moments later a sound of singing rose on the air and a youthful couple came into view walking close together their arms twined about each other caroling in serene indifference to such wayfarers as they might meet They passed him their faces uplifted to the light their mouths open in the abandon of their song Unconscious of his presence with upraised eyes and clasping arms they paced on filling the night with their voices a boy and girl in love singing in the moonlight Dominick quickened his steps hastening from the sound The moon was now high in the sky and the town lay dreaming under its spell Below him he could see the expanse of flat roofs shining surfaces between inlayings of shadow with the clefts of the streets cut through at regular intervals like slices made by a giant knife Now and then he looked up at the dome above clear and solemn the great disk floating in solitary majesty across the vast and thoughtful heaven That part of California Street which crested the hill was but a few blocks beyond him and before his mind would acknowledge it his feet had borne him that way He thought only to pass the Cannon house to look at its windows and see their lights As it rose before him a huge pale mass checkered with shadows the longing to see it the outer shell that hid his[ ] heart s desire passed into a keener concentrated agitation that seemed to press out from his soul like a cry to her The porch yawned black behind pillars that in the daytime were painted wood and now looked like temple columns wrought in marble Dominick s glance sweeping the lines of yellowed windows finally rested on this cavern of shadow and he approached stealthily as a robber might his body close to the iron fence Almost before his eyes had told him he knew that a woman was standing there leaning against the balustrade that stretched between the columns A climbing rose spread in a mottling of darkness over the wall beside her Here and there it was starred with the small white faces of blossoms As the young man drew near she leaned over the balustrade plucked one of the blossoms and slowly shredding the leaves from the stem stretched out her hand and let them fall like a languid shower of silver drops to the grass Dominick halted below her leaning against the fence and looking up She did not see him and stretched out her hand again for another blossom The petals of this one fell through her fingers one by one and lay a scattering of white dots on the darkness of the grass She bent over the balustrade to look at them and in doing so her eyes encountered the man below For a moment they looked at each other without[ ] speaking then she said her voice at the lowest note that would reach him What are you doing there Watching you Have you been standing there long No only a few minutes Why are you pulling the roses to pieces She gave a little laugh and said something that sounded like I don t know and moved back from the balustrade He thought she was going and clutched the iron spikes of the fence calling up to her in a voice of urgent feeling curiously out of keeping with the words the first remark that came into his head This is very different from Antelope isn t it She came forward again and looked out and up at the sky Yes she said gravely we had no moonlight there nothing but storms and gray clouds But it was lovely he answered in the same key The clouds and the storms didn t matter Those were three three great weeks He ended lamely but they were the best words he could get trying to say something that would keep her there trying to see her through the vaporous light She bent over the railing looking for another rose but there were no more within her reach and she gave the short nervous laugh she had given before and turned her eyes[ ] on him again Then he realized that she was agitated The knowledge augmented his own perturbation and for a moment he did not trust himself to speak He gazed at her fixedly the look of a lover and was not conscious that she wavered under it till she suddenly drew a quick breath turned her head sidewise and said with an effort at naturalness Well I must go in The roses are all picked and papa ll be wondering where I am It seemed to Dominick just then that he could not lose her She must stay a moment longer Urgency that was imploring was in his voice as he said Don t go don t go Stay just one moment longer Can t you come down and talk for a minute Come part of the way down I want to speak to you for a little bit longer It may be months before I see you again She listened wavered and was won over Without answer she turned from the shadow of the porch into the light on the top of the steps and from there slowly descended her skirt gathered in one hand and the other touching the baluster She was in black and from its dead density her arms bare to the elbow shone as white as the arms of a marble woman The baluster ended in a lion crouching in sleep on a slab of stone and she paused here and Dominick went up the few steps from the street to meet her [ ] With the sleeping lion between them they looked at each other with troubled eyes The moonlight seemed to have drawn from the meeting the artificialities of worldly expression which in the sensible familiar daylight would have placed it on the footing of a casual to be expected encounter The sun beating down on lovers beats some of their sentimental transports out of them Now in this mystic beautifying luminosity the acquired point of view the regard for the accepted conventions of every day seemed to have receded to a great distance to be thin forgotten things that had nothing to do with real life For a moment Berny ceased to be a living presence standing with a flaming sword between them They almost forgot her The memory that pressed upon them was that of their last meeting It shone in their eyes and trembled on their lips The sleeping lion that separated them was a singularly appropriate symbol Low voiced and half spoken sentences belonged to this romantic moment The moonlit night around them was still and empty but Dominick spoke as though other ears than hers were listening I ve wanted so to see you I came by to night hoping that perhaps I could catch a glimpse of your shadow on the curtain I didn t expect anything like this [ ]He stopped looking at her and not listening to the few words of her answer I think I wanted you so that my will called you out he said in an impassioned whisper She said nothing and suddenly his hand sought hers clasped it tight on the head of the lion and he whispered again Oh Rose if I could see you now and then only for a moment like this He felt her hand small and cold crush softly inside his and almost immediately was conscious of her effort to withdraw it He instantly loosened his fingers let hers slide from his grasp and drew back Good night she said hurriedly and without looking at him turned and went up the steps Good night he called after her following her ascending figure with his eyes When she reached the shadow at the top of the steps she called Good by passed into the engulfing blackness and was gone He waited till he heard the door bang behind her then descended the steps and walked slowly home his eyes on the pavement Berny was in her own room ready for bed when she heard his ascending footsteps She was occupied in rubbing a skin food into her face with careful circular motions and pinchings of her finger tips It was a task that required deep attention and which she performed three nights[ ] in the week with conscientious regularity With her face gleaming with grease she crept to her door and listened heard his cane slide into the umbrella holder and the door of his room shut with a softness which told her that he thought her asleep She walked back to the glass and resumed her manipulations but with diminished zeal The clock on the bureau marked the hour at half past ten Dominick had been out two hours Would a man walk round a city even a crank like her husband all by himself for two hours vista n From my
