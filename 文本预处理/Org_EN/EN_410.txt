The little shop was closed The fruit trays had been carried in and the shutters put up and from an upper window a line of light gleamed on the deserted street Achilles glanced at it and turned into an alley at the side groping his way toward the rear He stopped and fumbled for a knob and rapped sharply But a hand was already on the door scrambling to undo it and an eager face confronted him flashing white teeth at him You come said the boy swiftly He turned and fled up the stairs and Achilles followed A faint sense of onions was in the air Achilles sniffed it gratefully He remembered suddenly that he had not eaten since morning But the boy did not pause for him he was beckoning with mysterious hand from a doorway and Achilles followed Alcie got hurt whispered the boy He was trembling with fear and excitement and he pointed to the bed across the room Achilles stepped with lightest tread and looked down A boy half asleep murmured and turned his head restlessly A red clotted blur ran along the forehead and the face streaked with mud was drawn in a look of pain As Achilles bent over him the boy cried out and threw up a hand then he turned his head muttering and dozed again Achilles withdrew lightly beckoning to the boy beside him Yaxis followed his eyes on the figure on the bed All day he said he lie sick Achilles closed the door softly and turned to him Tell me Yaxis what happened he said The boy s face opened dramatically I look up I see Alcie like that his gesture fitted to the room He stand in door all covered mud blood run cart broke no fruit no hat The boy s hands were everywhere as he spoke dispensing fruit smashing carts and filling up the broken words with horror and a flow of blood Achilles s face grew grave The Greeks were not without persecution in the land of freedom and his boy had lain all day suffering while he had been lost in the great house by the lake He took off his coat and turned back his sleeves You bring water he said gently We will see what hurts him But the boy had put his supper on the table and was beckoning him with swift gesture You eat he said pleadingly And Achilles ate hastily and gave directions for the basin of water and towels and a sponge and the boy carried them into the room beyond Half an hour later Alcibiades lay in bed his clothes removed and the blood washed from his face and hair The clotted line still oozed a little on the temple and the look of pain had not gone away Achilles watched him with anxious eyes He bent over the bed and spoke to him soothingly his voice gentle as a woman s in its soft Greek accents but the look of pain in the boy s face deepened and his voice chattered shrill They watched the ambulance drive away from in front of the striped awning Achilles held a card in his thin fingers a card that would admit him to his boy Yaxis s eyes were gloomy with dread and his quick movements were subdued as he went about the business of the shop carrying the trays of fruit to the stall outside and arranging the fruit under the striped awning He was not to go out with the push cart to day There was too much work to do and Achilles could not let the boy go from him Later too Achilles must go to the hospital and to the big house on the lake and someone must be left with the shop So he kept the boy beside him looking at him now and then with deep quiet eyes that seemed to see the city taking its toll of life of children the children at play and the children at work This land that he had sought with his boys where the wind of freedom blew fresh from the prairies and the sea and even little children were not safe He seemed to see it through the day this great monster that gathered them in from all lands and trod them beneath its great feet crushing them while they lifted themselves to it and threw themselves and prayed to it for the new day that they had come so far to seek But when Achilles presented his ticket for the boy at the hospital door it was a woman of his own race who met him dark eyed and strong and smiled at him a flash of sympathy Yes he is doing well They operated at once Come and see But you must not speak to him She led him cautiously down the long corridor between the beds See he is asleep She bent over him touching the bandage Beneath it the dark skin was pallid but the breath came easily from the sleeping lips She smiled at Achilles guiding him from the room ignoring the tears that looked at her He is doing well you see It was pressure that caused the fever the bone was not injured He will recover quickly Yes We are glad And Achilles out under the clear sky raised his face and caught the sound of the city its murmured innumerable toil and the great clang of wheels turning And he drew a deep quick breath A city of power and swift care for its own The land of many hands reaching out to the world And Achilles s head lifted itself under the sky and a mighty force knit within him a deep quiet force out of
