When Henrietta Hen s callers crowded about her nest in the haymow they expected to see something wonderful But when they craned their necks and peered into the little hollowed out snuggery in the hay they couldn t help being disappointed And when they didn t burst forth with cries of surprise and praise Henrietta Hen looked quite unhappy I thought she said you d want to see this egg I m sure you never beheld a bigger nor a whiter one than this They admitted that the egg was big and that it was very very white And if their praise was faint Henrietta never noticed it Are you going to let Farmer Green have that egg one of the company inquired No doubt Johnnie Green will grab it as soon as he finds my nest said Henrietta with something like a sigh If I could only keep this one I wouldn t care how many others he took Polly Plymouth Rock turned to old Whitey a hen who had come with her to the haymow What do you think Polly asked Is Henrietta in danger of losing this egg that she thinks so much of She needn t be alarmed old Whitey answered If Johnnie Green robs her of this one I ll miss my guess Oh I m glad to hear you say that Henrietta Hen cried Now I won t need to worry that is if you know what you re talking about That of course was a most impolite way for Henrietta Hen to speak to anybody of old Whitey s age Whitey was the oldest hen in the flock And what she didn t know about such things as nests and eggs and roosts wasn t worth knowing Polly Plymouth Rock didn t like Henrietta Hen s remark She opened her mouth And no doubt she would have said something quite sharp in reply But old Whitey stopped her Never mind said Whitey The day will come when Henrietta Hen will agree that my guess is a good one Still Henrietta Hen felt uneasy about that big white egg I do hope Johnnie Green won t find this new nest of mine she remarked If he does I fear he ll take my beautiful egg away from me Lay another said old Whitey Lay another and he ll take that and leave this one I suppose I may as well try your scheme Henrietta replied since nobody suggests anything better My idea s a good one or I ll miss my guess said old Whitey There was some snickering among Henrietta Hen s callers as they bade her good afternoon and left her They re laughing at old Whitey she said to herself She hadn t the slightest notion that they could be giggling at her Old Whitey must be wrong she thought But I may as well take her advice for I don t know what else to do Not long afterward Henrietta Hen came fluttering down from the haymow squawking at the top of her lungs for old Whitey And as soon as she found her Henrietta cried Come up to my nest right away I want to ask your advice Although she didn t say Please old Whitey went with her forth adv The wind moved the trees gently back and forth He gave forth a series of works in rapid succession beheld v behold His eyes had never beheld such opulence The soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment giggling v giggle We just sat there giggling like naughty schoolchildren I can t stand her giggling she s so silly afterward adv Let s go to the theatre first and eat afterward Afterward the boy became a very famous artist
