The fine gray head the hawklike aristocratic face and the superior manner of Waters procured him admission to many places where the ordinary man was barred It secured him admission on this day to the office of Sheriff McGuire though McGuire had refused to see his best friends A proof of the perturbed state of his mind was that he accepted the proffered fresh cigar of Waters without comment or thanks His mental troubles made him crisp to the point of rudeness I m a tolerable busy man Mr Waters I think they said your name was Tell me what you want and make it short if you don t mind Not a bit sir I rarely waste many words But I think on this occasion we have a subject in common that will interest you Waters had come on what he felt was more or less of a wild goose chase The great object was to keep young Hollis from coming in contact with Elizabeth Cornish again One such interview as Vance Cornish had assured him would restore the boy to the ranch make him the heir to the estate and turn Vance and his high ambitions out of doors Also the high commission of Mr Waters would cease With no plan in mind he had rushed to the point of contact and hoped to find some scheme after he arrived there As for Vance the latter would promise money otherwise he was a shaken wreck of a man and of no use But with money Mr Waters felt that he had the key to this world and he was not without hope Three hours in the hotel of the town gave him many clues Three hours of casual gossip on the veranda of the same hotel had placed him in possession of about every fact true or presumably true that could be learned and with the knowledge a plan sprang into his fertile brain The worn worried face of the sheriff had been like water on a dry field he felt that the seed of his plan would immediately spring up and bear fruit And that thing we got in common said the sheriff tersely It s this young Terry Hollis He let that shot go home without a follow up and was pleased to see the sheriff s forehead wrinkle with pain He s like a ghost hauntin me declared McGuire with an attempted laugh that failed flatly Every time I turn around somebody throws this Hollis in my face What is it now Do you mind if I run over the situation briefly as I understand it Fire away The sheriff settled back he had forgotten his rush of business As I understand it you Mr McGuire have the reputation of keeping your county clean of crime and scenes of violence Huh grunted the sheriff Everyone says went on Waters that no one except a man named Minter has done such work in meeting the criminal element on their own ground You have kept your county peaceful I believe that is true Huh repeated McGuire Kind of soft soapy but it ain t all wrong They ain t been much doing in these parts since I started to clean things up Until recently suggested Waters The face of the sheriff darkened Well he asked aggressively And then two crimes in a row First a gun brawl in broad daylight young Hollis shot a fellow named er Larrimer snapped the sheriff viciously It was a square fight Larrimer forced the scrap I suppose so Nevertheless it was a gunfight And next two men raid the bank in the middle of your town and in spite of you and of special guards blow the door off a safe and gut the safe of its contents Am I right The sheriff merely scowled It ain t clear to me yet he declared how you and me get together on any topic we got in common Looks sort of like we was just hearing one old yarn over and over agin My dear sir smiled Waters you have not allowed me to come to the crux of my story Which is that you and I have one great object in common to dispose of this Terry Hollis for I take it for granted that if you were to get rid of him the people who criticize now would do nothing but cheer you Am I right If I could get him sighed the sheriff Mr Waters gimme time and I ll get him right enough But the trouble with the gents around these parts is that they been spoiled I cleaned up all the bad ones so damn quick that they think I can do the same with every crook that comes along But this Hollis is a slick one I tell you He covers his tracks Laughs in my face and admits what he done when he talks to me like he done the other day But as far as evidence goes I ain t got anything on him yet But I ll get it And in the meantime said Waters brutally they say that you re getting old The sheriff became a brilliant purple Do they say that he muttered That s gratitude for you Mr Waters After what I ve done for em they say I m getting old just because I can t get anything on this slippery kid right off He changed from purple to gray To fail now and lose his position meant a ruined life And Waters knew what was in his mind But if you got Terry Hollis they d be stronger behind you than ever Ah wouldn t they though Tell me what a great gent I was quick as a flash He sneered at the thought of public opinion And you see said Waters where I come in is that I have a plan for getting this Hollis you desire so much You do He rose and grasped the arm of Waters You do Waters nodded It s this way I understand that he killed Larrimer and Larrimer s older brother is the one who is rousing public opinion against you Am I right The dog Yes you re right Then get Larrimer to send Terry Hollis an invitation to come down into town and meet him face to face in a gun fight I understand this Hollis is a daredevil sort and wouldn t refuse an invitation of that nature He d have to respond or else lose his growing reputation as a maneater Maneater Why Bud Larrimer wouldn t be more n a mouthful for him Sure he d come to town And he d clean up quick But Larrimer ain t fool enough to send such an invite You don t understand me persisted Waters patiently What I mean is this Larrimer sends the challenge if you wish to call it that He takes up a certain position Say in a public place You and your men if you wish are posted nearby but out of view when young Hollis comes When Terry Hollis arrives the moment he touches a gun butt you fill him full of lead and accuse him of using unfair play against Larrimer Any excuse will do The public want an end of young Hollis They won t be particular with their questions He found it difficult to meet the narrowed eyes of the sheriff What you want me to do said the sheriff with slow effort is to set a trap get Hollis into it and then murder him A brutal way of putting it my dear fellow A true way said the sheriff But he was thinking and Waters waited When he spoke his voice was soft enough to blend with the sheriff s thoughts without actually interrupting them You re not a youngster any more sheriff and if you lose out here your reputation is gone for good You ll not have the time to rebuild it Here is a chance for you not only to stop the evil rumors but to fortify your past record with a new bit of work that will make people talk of you They don t really care how you do it They won t split hairs about method They want Hollis put out of the way I say cache yourself away Let Hollis come to meet Larrimer in a private room You can arrange it with Larrimer yourself later on You shoot from concealment the moment Hollis shows his face It can be said that Larrimer did the shooting and beat Hollis to the draw The glory of it will bribe Larrimer The sheriff shook his head Waters leaned forward My friend he said I represent in this matter a wealthy man to whom the removal of Terry Hollis will be worth money Five thousand dollars cash sheriff The sheriff moistened his lips and his eyes grew wild He had lived long and worked hard and saved little Yet he shook his head Ten thousand dollars whispered Waters Cash The sheriff groaned rose paced the room and then slumped into a chair Tell Bud Larrimer I want to see him he said The following letter which was received at the house of Joe Pollard was indeed a gem of English MR TERRY BLACK JACK Sir I got this to say Since you done my brother dirt I bin looking for a chans to get even and I ain t seen any chanses coming my way so Ime going to make one which I mean that Ile be waiting for you in town today and if you don t come Ile let the boys know that you aint only an ornery mean skunk but your a yaller hearted dog also which I beg to remain Yours very truly Bud Larrimer Terry Hollis read the letter and tossed it with laughter to Phil Marvin who sat cross legged on the floor mending a saddle and Phil and the rest of the boys shook their heads over it What I can t make out said Joe Pollard voicing the sentiments of the rest is how Bud Larrimer that s as slow as a plow horse with a gun could ever find the guts to challenge Terry Hollis to a fair fight Kate Pollard rose anxiously with a suggestion Today or tomorrow at the latest she expected the arrival of Elizabeth Cornish and so far it had been easy to keep Terry at the house The gang was gorged with the loot of the Lewison robbery and Terry s appetite for excitement had been cloyed by that event also This strange challenge from the older Larrimer was the fly in the ointment It ain t hard to tell why he sent that challenge she declared He has some sneaking plan up his sleeve Dad You know Bud Larrimer He hasn t the nerve to fight a boy How ll he ever manage to stand up to Terry unless he s got hidden backing She herself did not know how accurately she was hitting off the situation but she was drawing it as black as possible to hold Terry from accepting the challenge It was her father who doubted her suggestion It sounds queer he said but the gents of these parts don t make no ambushes while McGuire is around He s a clean shooter is McGuire and he don t stand for no shady work with guns Again Kate went to the attack But the sheriff would do anything to get Terry You know that And maybe he isn t so particular about how it s done Dad don t you let Terry make a step toward town I know something would happen And even if they didn t ambush him he would be outlawed even if he won the fight No matter how fair he may fight they won t stand for two killings in so short a time You know that Dad They d have a mob out here to lynch him You re right Kate nodded her father Terry you better stay put But Terry Hollis had risen and stretched himself to the full length of his height and extended his long arms sleepily Every muscle played smoothly up his arms and along his shoulders He was fit for action from the top of his head to the soles of his feet Partners he announced gently no matter what Bud Larrimer has on his mind I ve got to go in and meet him Maybe I can convince him without gun talk I hope so But it will have to be on the terms he wants I ll saddle up and lope into town He started for the door The other members of the Pollard gang looked at one another and shrugged their shoulders Plainly the whole affair was a bad mess If Terry shot Larrimer he would certainly be followed by a lynching mob because no self respecting Western town could allow two members of its community to be dropped in quick succession by one man of an otherwise questionable past No matter how fair the gunplay just as Kate had said the mob would rise But on the other hand how could Terry refuse to respond to such an invitation without compromising his reputation as a man without fear There was nothing to do but fight But Kate ran to her father Dad she cried you got to stop him He looked into her drawn face in astonishment Look here honey he advised rather sternly Man talk is man talk and man ways are man ways and a girl like you can t understand You keep out of this mess It s bad enough without having your hand added She saw there was nothing to be gained in this direction She turned to the rest of the men they watched her with blank faces Not a man there but would have done much for the sake of a single smile But how could they help Desperately she ran to the door jerked it open and followed Terry to the stable He had swung the saddle from its peg and slipped it over the back of El Sangre and the great stallion turned to watch this perennially interesting operation Terry she said I want ten words with you I know what you want to say he answered gently You want to make me stay away from town today To tell you the truth Kate I hate to go in I hate it like the devil But what can I do I have no grudge against Larrimer But if he wants to talk about his brother s death why good Lord Kate I have to go in and listen don t I I can t dodge that responsibility It s a trick Terry I swear it s a trick I can feel it She dropped her hand nervously on the heavy revolver which she wore strapped at her hip and fingered the gold chasing Without her gun ever since early girlhood she had felt that her toilet was not complete It may be he nodded thoughtfully And I appreciate the advice Kate but what would you have me do Terry she said eagerly you know what this means You ve killed once If you go into town today it means either that you kill or get killed And one thing is about as bad as the other Again he nodded She was surprised that he would admit so much but there were parts of his nature which plainly she had not yet reached to What difference does it make Kate His voice fell into a profound gloom What difference I can t change myself I m what I am It s in the blood I was born to this I can t help it I know that I ll lose in the end But while I live I ll be happy A little while She choked But the sight of his drawing the cinches the imminence of his departure cleared her mind again Give me two minutes she begged Not one he answered Kate you only make us both unhappy Do you suppose I wouldn t change if I could He came to her and took her hands Honey there are a thousand things I d like to say to you but being what I am I have no right to say them to you never or to any other woman I m born to be what I am I tell you Kate the woman who raised me who was a mother to me saw what I was going to be and turned me out like a dog And I don t blame her She was right She grasped at the straw of hope Terry that woman has changed her mind You hear She s lived heartbroken since she turned you out And now she s coming for you to to beg you to come back to her Terry that s how much she s given up hope in you But he drew back his face growing dark You ve been to see her Kate That s where you went when you were away those four days She dared not answer He was trembling with hurt pride and rage You went to her she thought I sent you that I ve grown ashamed of my own father and that I want to beg her to take me back Is that what she thinks He struck his hand across his forehead and groaned God I d rather die than have her think it for a minute Kate how could you do it I d have trusted you always to do the right thing and the proud thing and here you ve shamed me He turned to the horse and El Sangre stepped out of the stall and into a shaft of sunlight that burned on him like blood red fire And beside him young Terry Hollis straight as a pine and as strong a glorious figure It broke her heart to see him knowing what was coming Terry if you ride down yonder you re going to a dog s death I swear you are Terry She stretched out her arms to him but he turned to her with his hand on the pommel and his face was like iron I ve made my choice Will you stand aside Kate You re set on going Nothing will change you But I tell you I m going to change you I m only a girl And I can t stop you with a girl s weapons I ll do it with a man s Terry take the saddle off that horse And promise me you ll stay here till Elizabeth Cornish comes Elizabeth Cornish He laughed bitterly When she conies I ll be a hundred miles away and bound farther off That s final You re wrong she cried hysterically You re going to stay here You may throw away your share in yourself But I have a share that I won t throw away Terry for the last time He shook his head She caught her breath with a sob Someone was coming from the outside She heard her father s deep throated laughter Whatever was done she must do it quickly And he must be stopped The hand on the gun butt jerked up the long gun flashed in her hand Kate cried Terry Good God are you mad Yes she sobbed Mad Will you stay What infernal nonsense The gun boomed hollowly in the narrow passage between mow and wall El Sangre reared a red flash in the sunlight and landed far away in the shadow trembling But Terry Hollis had spun halfway around swung by the heavy tearing impact of the big slug and then sank to the floor where he sat clasping his torn thigh with both hands his shoulder and head sagging against the wall Joe Pollard rushing in with an outcry found the gun lying sparkling in the sunshine and his daughter hysterical and weeping holding the wounded man in her arms What in the name of he roared Accident Joe gasped Terry Fooling with Kate s gun and trying a spin with it It went off drilled me clean through the leg That night very late in Joe Pollard s house Terry Hollis lay on the bed with a dim light reaching to him from the hooded lamp in the corner of the room His arms were stretched out on each side and one hand held that of Kate warm soft young clasping his fingers feverishly and happily And on the other side was the firm cool pressure of the hand of Aunt Elizabeth His mind was in a haze Vaguely he perceived the gleam of tears on the face of Elizabeth And he had heard her say All the time I didn t know Terry I thought I was ashamed of the blood in you But this girl opened my eyes She told me the truth The reason I took you in was because I loved that wild fierce gentle terrible father of yours If you have done a little of what he did what does it matter Nothing to me Oh Terry nothing in the world to me Except that Kate brought me to my senses in time bless her and now I have you back dear boy He remembered smiling faintly and happily at that And he said before he slept It s a bit queer isn t it even two wise women can t show a man that he s a fool It takes a bullet to turn the trick But when he went to sleep his head turned a little from Elizabeth toward Kate And the women raised their heads and looked at one another with filmy eyes They both understood what that feeble gesture meant It told much of the fine heart of Elizabeth that she was able to smile at the girl and forgive her for having stolen again what she had restored It was the break up of the Pollard gang the sudden disaffection of their newest and most brilliant member Joe himself was financed by Elizabeth Cornish and opened a small string of small town hotels Which is just another angle of the road business he often said except that the law works with you and not agin you But he never quite recovered from the restoration of the Lewison money on which Elizabeth and Terry both insisted Neither did Denver Pete He left them in disgust and was never heard of again in those parts And he always thereafter referred to Terry as a promising kid gone
