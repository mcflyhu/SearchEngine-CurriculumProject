Saturday afternoons and Sundays gave the pause in Eve s week of scribbling and reading and drawing at desk and table She was infinitely glad of the leisure when it came only to discover that it often brought a retrospective sadness that could not be conjured away Sometimes she went to a matin e or a concert on Saturday afternoon alternating these breaks with afternoons of hard work For the Fernhill days with their subsequent pain and restlessness had left her with a definite ambition She regarded her present life as a means to an end She did not intend to be always a scribbler of extracts and a copier of old woodcuts but had visions of her own art spreading its wings and lifting her out of the crowd She tried to paint on Sundays struggling with the atmosphere of Bosnia Road and attempting to make use of the north light in her back bedroom while she enlarged and elaborated some of the rough sketches in her sketch book Her surroundings were trite and dreary enough but youth and ardour are marvellous torch bearers and many a fine thing has been conceived and carried through in a London lodging house She had plans for hiring a little studio somewhere or even of persuading Mrs Buss her landlady to let her have a makeshift shed put up in the useless patch of back garden When she looked back on the Fernhill days they seemed to her very strange and wonderful covered with a bloom of mystery touched with miraculous sunlight She hoped that they would help her to do big work The memories were in her blood she was the richer for them even though she had suffered and still suffered Now that she was in London the summer seemed more beautiful than it had been nor did she remind herself that it had happened to be one of those rare fine summers that appear occasionally just to make the average summer seem more paltry When she had received a cheque for some eighty pounds representing the sum her furniture had brought her after the payment of all expenses she had written to Canterton and returned him the hundred pounds he had paid her pleading that it irked her memories of their comradeship She had given Kate Duveen s address after asking her friend s consent and in her letter she had written cheerfully and bravely desiring Canterton to remember their days together but not to attempt to see her You will be kind and not come into this new life of mine I am not ashamed to say that I have suffered but that I have nothing to regret Since I am alone it is best that I should be alone You will understand When the pain has died down one does not want old wounds reopened I think daily of Lynette Kiss her for me Some day it may be possible for me to see her again Three weeks passed before Kate Duveen handed Eve a letter as they crossed Russell Square in the direction of Tottenham Court Road It was a raw misty morning and the plane trees with their black boles and boughs looked sombre and melancholy This came for you She saw the colour rise in Eve s face and the light that kindled deep down in her eyes Not cured yet Have I asked to be cured Eve read Canterton s letter at her desk at Miss Champion s It was a longish letter and as she read it she seemed to hear him talking in the fir woods below Orchards Corner Dear Eve I write to you as a man who has been humbled and who has had to bear the bitterness of not being able to make amends I came to see things with your eyes quite suddenly the very morning that you went away I took Lynette with me to Orchards Corner to show her as a symbol of my surrender But you had gone I was humbled And the silence that shut me in humbled me still more I did not try to discover things though that might have been easy As to your leaving Fernhill so suddenly I managed to smother all comment upon that You had been offered unexpectedly a very good post in London and your mother s death had made you feel restless at Orchards Corner That was what I said Lynette talks of you very often It is When will Miss Eve come down to see us Won t she spend her holidays here Won t you take me to London daddy to see Miss Eve As for this money that you have returned to me I have put it aside and added a sum to it for a certain purpose that has taken my fancy I let you return it to me because I have some understanding of your pride I am glad deeply glad that good luck has come to you If I can serve you at any time and in any way you can count on me to the last breath I am a different man in some respects from the man I was three months ago Try to realise that Try to realise what it suggests If you realise it will you let me see you now and again just as a comrade and a friend Say yes or no James Canterton Eve was bemused all day her eyes looking through her work into infinite distances She avoided Kate Duveen whose unsentimental directness would have hurt her lunched by herself and walked home alone to Bosnia Road She sat staring at the fire most of the evening before she wrote to Canterton Your letter has made me both sad and happy Jim Don t feel humbled on my account The humiliation should be mine because neither the world nor I could match your magnanimity Sometimes my heart is very hungry for sight of Lynette Yes I am working hard It is better that I should say No Eve Four days passed before Kate handed her another letter Perhaps you are right and I am wrong If it is your wish that I should not see you I bow to it with all reverence Do not think that I do not understand Some day perhaps you will come to see Lynette Or I could bring her up to town and leave her at your friend s for you to find her I promise to lay no ambuscades When you have gone I can call for her again I should love her better because she had been near you Kate Duveen was hard at work one evening struggling with the help of a dictionary through a tough book on German philosophy when the maid knocked at her door What is it Polly The girl s name was Ermentrude but Kate persisted in calling her Polly There s a gentleman downstairs miss E s sent up is card E wondered whether you d see im Kate glanced at the card and read James Canterton She hesitated a moment Yes I will see him Ask him up Her hard workaday self had risen as to a challenge She felt an almost fierce eagerness to meet this man to give him battle and rout him with her truth telling and sarcastic tongue Canterton as she imagined him stood for all the old man made sexual conveniences and the social makeshift that she hated He was the big prejudiced male grudging a corner of the working world to women but ready enough to make use of them when his passions or his sentiments were stirred When he came into the room she did not rise from the table but remained sitting there with her books before her Miss Duveen Yes Will you shut the door and sit down She spoke with a rigid asperity and he obeyed her but without any sign of embarrassment or nervousness There was just a subtle something that made her look at him more intently more interestedly as though he was not the sort of man she had expected to see It is Mr Canterton of Fernhill is it not Yes She was merciless enough to sit there in silence with her rigid watchful face waiting for him to break the frost Her mood had passed suddenly beyond mere prejudice She felt the fighting spirit in her piqued by a suspicion that she was dealing with no ordinary man He sat in one of her arm chairs facing her and meeting her eyes with perfect candour I am wondering whether I must explain Your call and its object Yes I don t think it is necessary I think I know why you have come So much the better She caught him up as though he were assuming her to be a possible accomplice I may as well tell you that you will get nothing out of me She does not live here Perhaps you will tell me what you imagine my object to be You want Eve Carfax s address For the first time she saw that she had stung him Then I can assure you you are wrong I have no intention of asking for it It is a point of honour She repeated the words slowly and in a quiet and ironical voice A point of honour She became conscious of his smile a smile that began deep down in his eyes It angered her a little because it suggested that his man s knowledge was deeper wiser and kinder than hers I take it Miss Duveen that you are Eve s very good friend I hope so That is exactly why I have come to you Understand me Eve is not to know that I have been here Thank you Please dictate what you please I will I want you to tell me just how she is if she is in really bearable surroundings Kate s eyes studied him over her books Here was something more vital than German philosophy Mr Canterton I ought to tell you that I know a little of what has happened this summer Not that Eve is a babbler I am glad that you know Really I should not have thought that you would be glad I am Will you answer my question And may I ask what claim you have to be told anything about Eve He answered her quietly I have no right at all A smile very like a glimmer of approval flickered in her eyes You recognise that Wasn t it rather a pity Miss Duveen I have not come here to justify anything I wanted a fine working comradeship and Eve showed me that for a particular reason it was impossible Till I met her there was nothing on earth so dear to me as my child Lynette When Eve came into my life she shared it with the child Is it monstrous or impertinent that I should desire to know whether she is in the way of being happy Kate saw in him a man different from the common crowd of men and Eve s defence of him recurred to her His frankness was the frankness of strength His bronzed head with its blue eyes and generous mouth began to take on a new dignity Mr Canterton I am not an admirer of men You should have studied flowers Thank you I will answer your question Eve is earning a living It is not luxury but it is better than most women workers can boast of She works hard And she has ambitions He answered at once I am glad of that Ambition the drive of life is everything You have given me good news Kate Duveen sat in thought a moment staring at the pages of German philosophy Mr Canterton I m interested I am going to be intrusive Is it possible for a man to be impersonal Yes and no It depends upon the plane to which one has climbed You could be impersonally kind to Eve I think that I told you that I am very fond of my youngster Lynette That is personal and yet impersonal It is not of the flesh She nodded her head and he rose I will ask you to promise me two things What are they That if Eve should wish to see Lynette I may leave the child here and call for her again after Eve has gone Kate considered the point Yes that s sensible enough I can see no harm in it And the other thing That if Eve should be in trouble at any time you will promise to let me know She looked at him sharply Wait It flashed across your mind that I am waiting for my opportunity You are descending to the level of the ordinary man whom you despise I asked this because I should want to help her without her knowing Kate Duveen stood up You scored a hit there Yes I ll promise that Of course Eve will never know you have been here I rely on you there Men are apt to forget that women have pride She held out a hand to him There s my pledge I can assure you that I had some bitter things under my tongue when you came in I have not said them They could not have hurt more than some of my own thoughts have hurt me That s the mistake people make The whip does not wound so much as compassion Yes that s true A blow puts our egotism in a temper I ll remember that I am glad that you are Eve s friend Kate Duveen stood looking down into the fire after Canterton had gone One must not indulge in absolute generalities she thought Men can be big sometimes Now for this stodgy old German scribbling n [ ] [ ] [ ]v scribble Once the money got into the book all that remained were
