I stood ringing I thundered at the knocker I beat the door with my fist An old man opened at last Mrs Harborough Where is she The old man tried to keep me out But he was gentle and frail I forced my way past I called and ran along a passage trying doors that opened into the darkness At last A room where a woman sat alone reading by a shaded light Who are you I cried out She laid her book in her lap Are you Mrs Harborough Then come come quickly I ll tell you on the way The old woman lifted the folds of her double chin and looked at me through spectacles You must come and help me to get Bettina I broke into distracted sobbing on the name Bettina Bettina I seized the lady s hand and tried to draw her out of her chair [Pg ] But I was full of trembling She sat there massive calm with a power of inert resistance that made me feel I could as easily drag her house out of the Square by its knocker as move the woman planted there in her chair Neither haste nor perturbation in the voice that asked me What has happened Not yet I cried out Nothing has happened yet But we must be quick Oh God let us be quick The butler had followed me in and was asking something Yes said the quiet voice pay the cabman No I shrieked Keep him I must go back instantly And through my own strange sounding voice hers reached me You must see that you are quite unintelligible Sit down and collect yourself Sit down Isn t it enough that one woman sits still while while She was putting questions I heard a reproach that seemed to fill the house You never came to meet us And while the charge was ringing I felt with anguish the injustice of it How could one have expected this woman to come [Pg ] But she should be moved and stirred at last I sent my maid she was defending herself only a minute or two late The other woman was not late Who I begged the butler to get a cloak for Mrs Harborough She was saying Bettina and I should have waited And again that I must calm myself and tell her Someone pretended to be you I hurled it at her She took us to a house a place where they do worse than murder Betty is there now I told her all I could pack into a few sentences It isn t possible my aunt said This is England Come and see Betty But they only thought me mad they tortured me with questions I caught her by the arm God won t forgive you if you wait an instant more Oh but she was old and unbelieving So old I felt she had looked on unmoved at evil since the world began But she was sending for wraps sending messages Still she sat there in the heavy square backed chair her hands upon her knees her two[Pg ] feet side by side as motionless as the footstool her heavy shoulders high and square her lace cap with square ends falling either side her face like the head dress of an Egyptian her air of monumental calm more like a Theban statue than a living woman I turned away The figure in the chair rose up at last Oh but slowly slow and stiff and ponderous I felt in her all the heaviness of the acquiescent since Time began That is right she said to the old man who had brought the maid And the maid was old too Three helpless ghosts Like death the sense came over me that I was as badly off with these three as I had been alone Again I turned from them frantic I will go out I cried and find help I ran towards the door It was then the old man made the first sane suggestion We could telephone to the police That would save time The police would meet us outside Betty s prison [Pg ] I followed the butler into the hall We all stood there by the telephone Ages seemed to go by while he was getting the number And when he had got the number he could not hear the questions that were put I tore the receiver out of his hand I pushed him aside But I had never used the telephone before and I spoke too loudly When they told me so I sobbed The voice at the other end was faint and cool Oh the easy way the world was taking Betty s fate And then the faint cool voice at the other end said something which showed me I was not believed He too was thinking I was out of my mind The receiver dropped from my hand They cannot understand I said I told Mrs Harborough that she must go to Bettina and I would bring the police Some objection was made I did not stop to hear it I cannot wait for any words And I will not wait another second for any human soul Then running beside me as I made for the front door the old butler spoke again a[Pg ] policeman in our square He would call the policeman in The old man was right A policeman stood at the corner watching that no harm should come to the ladies of Lowndes Square I had run out with the butler protesting at my heels Not in the street miss he said with the first hint of emotion I had found in him I did not wait but he must have brought the policeman in during my outpouring for the look of the hall during those swift seconds is stamped on my brain The elderly maid kneeling at her mistress s feet changing her shoes the policeman facing my aunt helmet in hand his reverent eye falling before the dignity of Mrs Harborough while I at his elbow poured out broken sentences interlarded with I ll tell you the rest as we go My strained voice was grown weak I wondered suddenly if it had ever really reached their ears I was like a person down under the sea trying to make my voice heard through a mile of murky water [Pg ] I was like a woman buried alive who in the black middle of the night beats at her coffin lid in some deserted graveyard It is no use I cried I shall go back alone At last we were all going out of the door The policeman put on his helmet And where is this house he asked It is it is A pit of blackness opened I felt myself falling headlong I heard a cry that made my flesh writhe as though the cry had
