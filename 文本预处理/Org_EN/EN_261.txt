The stampede to French Hill was on by the beginning of Christmas week Corliss and Bishop had been in no hurry to record for they looked the ground over carefully before blazing their stakes and let a few close friends into the secret Harney Welse Trethaway a Dutch chechaquo who had forfeited both feet to the frost a couple of the mounted police an old pal with whom Del had prospected through the Black Hills Country the washerwoman at the Forks and last and notably Lucile Corliss was responsible for her getting in on the lay and he drove and marked her stakes himself though it fell to the colonel to deliver the invitation to her to come and be rich In accordance with the custom of the country those thus benefited offered to sign over half interests to the two discoverers Corliss would not tolerate the proposition Del was similarly minded though swayed by no ethical reasons He had enough as it stood Got my fruit ranch paid for double the size I was calculatin on he explained and if I had any more I wouldn t know what to do with it sure After the strike Corliss took it upon himself as a matter of course to look about for another man but when he brought a keen eyed Californian into camp Del was duly wroth Not on your life he stormed But you are rich now Vance answered and have no need to work Rich hell the pocket miner rejoined Accordin to covenant you can t fire me and I m goin to hold the job down as long as my sweet will ll let me Savve On Friday morning early all interested parties appeared before the Gold Commissioner to record their claims The news went abroad immediately In five minutes the first stampeders were hitting the trail At the end of half an hour the town was afoot To prevent mistakes on their property jumping moving of stakes and mutilation of notices Vance and Del after promptly recording started to return But with the government seal attached to their holdings they took it leisurely the stampeders sliding past them in a steady stream Midway Del chanced to look behind St Vincent was in sight footing it at a lively pace the regulation stampeding pack on his shoulders The trail made a sharp bend at that place and with the exception of the three of them no one was in sight Don t speak to me Don t recognize me Del cautioned sharply as he spoke buttoning his nose strap across his face which served to quite hide his identity There s a water hole over there Get down on your belly and make a blind at gettin a drink Then go on by your lonely to the claims I ve business of my own to handle And for the love of your bother don t say a word to me or to the skunk Don t let m see your face Corliss obeyed wonderingly stepping aside from the beaten path lying down in the snow and dipping into the water hole with an empty condensed milk can Bishop bent on one knee and stooped as though fastening his moccasin Just as St Vincent came up with him he finished tying the knot and started forward with the feverish haste of a man trying to make up for lost time I say hold on my man the correspondent called out to him Bishop shot a hurried glance at him and pressed on St Vincent broke into a run till they were side by side again Is this the way To the benches of French Hill Del snapped him short Betcher your life That s the way I m headin So long He ploughed forward at a tremendous rate and the correspondent half running swung in behind with the evident intention of taking the pace Corliss still in the dark lifted his head and watched them go but when he saw the pocket miner swerve abruptly to the right and take the trail up Adams Creek the light dawned upon him and he laughed softly to himself Late that night Del arrived in camp on Eldorado exhausted but jubilant Didn t do a thing to him he cried before he was half inside the tent flaps Gimme a bite to eat grabbing at the teapot and running a hot flood down his throat cookin fat slush old moccasins candle ends anything Then he collapsed upon the blankets and fell to rubbing his stiff leg muscles while Corliss fried bacon and dished up the beans What about m he exulted between mouthfuls Well you can stack your chips that he didn t get in on the French Hill benches How far is it my man in the well mimicked patronizing tones of St Vincent How far is it with the patronage left out How far to French Hill weakly How far do you think it is very weakly with a tremolo which hinted of repressed tears How far The pocket miner burst into roars of laughter which were choked by a misdirected flood of tea and which left him coughing and speechless Where d I leave m when he had recovered Over on the divide to Indian River winded plum beaten done for Just about able to crawl into the nearest camp and that s about all I ve covered fifty stiff miles myself so here s for bed Good night Don t call me in the mornin He turned into the blankets all standing and as he dozed off Vance could hear him muttering How far is it my man I say how far is it Regarding Lucile Corliss was disappointed I confess I cannot understand her he said to Colonel Trethaway I thought her bench claim would make her independent of the Opera House You can t get a dump out in a day the colonel interposed But you can mortgage the dirt in the ground when it prospects as hers does Yet I took that into consideration and offered to advance her a few thousand non interest bearing and she declined Said she didn t need it in fact was really grateful thanked me and said that any time I was short to come and see her Trethaway smiled and played with his watch chain What would you Life even here certainly means more to you and me than a bit of grub a piece of blanket and a Yukon stove She is as gregarious as the rest of us and probably a little more so Suppose you cut her off from the Opera House what then May she go up to the Barracks and consort with the captain s lady make social calls on Mrs Schoville or chum with Frona Don t you see Will you escort her in daylight down the public street Will you Vance demanded Ay the colonel replied unhesitatingly and with pleasure And so will I but He paused and gazed gloomily into the fire But see how she is going on with St Vincent As thick as thieves they are and always together Puzzles me Trethaway admitted I can grasp St Vincent s side of it Many irons in the fire and Lucile owns a bench claim on the second tier of French Hill Mark me Corliss we can tell infallibly the day that Frona consents to go to his bed and board if she ever does consent And that will be The day St Vincent breaks with Lucile Corliss pondered and the colonel went on But I can t grasp Lucile s side of it What she can see in St Vincent Her taste is no worse than than that of the rest of the women Vance broke in hotly I am sure that Frona could not display poor taste eh Corliss turned on his heel and walked out and left Colonel Trethaway smiling grimly Vance Corliss never knew how many people directly and indirectly had his cause at heart that Christmas week Two men strove in particular one for him and one for the sake of Frona Pete Whipple an old timer in the land possessed an Eldorado claim directly beneath French Hill also a woman of the country for a wife a swarthy breed not over pretty whose Indian mother had mated with a Russian fur trader some thirty years before at Kutlik on the Great Delta Bishop went down one Sunday morning to yarn away an hour or so with Whipple but found the wife alone in the cabin She talked a bastard English gibberish which was an anguish to hear so the pocket miner resolved to smoke a pipe and depart without rudeness But he got her tongue wagging and to such an extent that he stopped and smoked many pipes and whenever she lagged urged her on again He grunted and chuckled and swore in undertones while he listened punctuating her narrative regularly with hells which adequately expressed the many shades of interest he felt In the midst of it the woman fished an ancient leather bound volume all scarred and marred from the bottom of a dilapidated chest and thereafter it lay on the table between them Though it remained unopened she constantly referred to it by look and gesture and each time she did so a greedy light blazed in Bishop s eyes At the end when she could say no more and had repeated herself from two to half a dozen times he pulled out his sack Mrs Whipple set up the gold scales and placed the weights which he counterbalanced with a hundred dollars worth of dust Then he departed up the hill to the tent hugging the purchase closely and broke in on Corliss who sat in the blankets mending moccasins I ll fix m yet Del remarked casually at the same time patting the book and throwing it down on the bed Corliss looked up inquiringly and opened it The paper was yellow with age and rotten from the weather wear of trail while the text was printed in Russian I didn t know you were a Russian scholar Del he quizzed But I can t read a line of it Neither can I more s the pity nor does Whipple s woman savve the lingo I got it from her But her old man he was full Russian you know he used to read it aloud to her But she knows what she knows and what her old man knew and so do I And what do the three of you know Oh that s tellin Bishop answered coyly But you wait and watch my smoke and when you see it risin you ll know too Matt McCarthy came in over the ice Christmas week summed up the situation so far as Frona and St Vincent were concerned and did not like it Dave Harney furnished him with full information to which he added that obtained from Lucile with whom he was on good terms Perhaps it was because he received the full benefit of the sum of their prejudice but no matter how he at any rate answered roll call with those who looked upon the correspondent with disfavor It was impossible for them to tell why they did not approve of the man but somehow St Vincent was never much of a success with men This in turn might have been due to the fact that he shone so resplendently with women as to cast his fellows in eclipse for otherwise in his intercourse with men he was all that a man could wish There was nothing domineering or over riding about him while he manifested a good fellowship at least equal to their own Yet having withheld his judgment after listening to Lucile and Harney Matt McCarthy speedily reached a verdict upon spending an hour with St Vincent at Jacob Welse s and this in face of the fact that what Lucile had said had been invalidated by Matt s learning of her intimacy with the man in question Strong of friendship quick of heart and hand Matt did not let the grass grow under his feet Tis I ll be takin a social fling meself as befits a mimber iv the noble Eldorado Dynasty he explained and went up the hill to a whist party in Dave Harney s cabin To himself he added An belike if Satan takes his eye off his own I ll put it to that young cub iv his But more than once during the evening he discovered himself challenging his own judgment Probe as he would with his innocent wit Matt found himself baffled St Vincent certainly rang true Simple light hearted unaffected joking and being joked in all good nature thoroughly democratic Matt failed to catch the faintest echo of insincerity May the dogs walk on me grave he communed with himself while studying a hand which suffered from a plethora of trumps Is it the years are tellin puttin the frost in me veins and chillin the blood A likely lad an is it for me to misjudge because his is a takin way with the ladies Just because the swate creatures smile on the lad an flutter warm at the sight iv him Bright eyes and brave men Tis the way they have iv lovin valor They re shuddered an shocked at the cruel an bloody dades iv war yet who so quick do they lose their hearts to as the brave butcher bye iv a sodger Why not The lad s done brave things and the girls give him the warm soft smile Small reason that for me to be callin him the devil s own cub Out upon ye Matt McCarthy for a crusty old sour dough with vitals frozen an summer gone from yer heart Tis an ossification ye ve become But bide a wee Matt bide a wee he supplemented Wait till ye ve felt the fale iv his flesh The opportunity came shortly when St Vincent with Frona opposite swept in the full thirteen tricks A rampse Matt cried Vincent me lad a rampse Yer hand on it me brave It was a stout grip neither warm nor clammy but Matt shook his head dubiously What s the good iv botherin he muttered to himself as he shuffled the cards for the next deal Ye old fool Find out first how Frona darlin stands an if it s pat she is thin tis time for doin Oh McCarthy s all hunky Dave Harney assured them later on coming to the rescue of St Vincent who was getting the rough side of the Irishman s wit The evening was over and the company was putting on its wraps and mittens Didn t tell you bout his visit to the cathedral did he when he was on the Outside Well it was suthin like this ez he was explainin it to me He went to the cathedral durin service an took in the priests and choir boys in their surplices parkas he called em an watched the burnin of the holy incense An do ye know Dave he sez to me they got in an made a smudge and there wa n t a darned mosquito in sight True ivery word iv it Matt unblushingly fathered Harney s yarn An did ye niver hear tell iv the time Dave an me got drunk on condensed milk Oh Horrors cried Mrs Schoville But how Do tell us Twas durin the time iv the candle famine at Forty Mile Cold snap on an Dave slides into me shack to pass the time o day and glues his eyes on me case iv condensed milk How d ye like a sip iv Moran s good whiskey he sez eyin the case iv milk the while I confiss me mouth went wet at the naked thought iv it But what s the use iv likin sez I with me sack bulgin with emptiness Candles worth tin dollars the dozen sez he a dollar apiece Will ye give six cans iv milk for a bottle iv the old stuff How ll ye do it sez I Trust me sez he Give me the cans Tis cold out iv doors an I ve a pair iv candle moulds An it s the sacred truth I m tellin ye all an if ye run across Bill Moran he ll back me word for what does Dave Harney do but lug off me six cans freeze the milk into his candle moulds an trade them in to bill Moran for a bottle iv tanglefoot As soon as he could be heard through the laughter Harney raised his voice It s true as McCarthy tells but he s only told you the half Can t you guess the rest Matt Matt shook his head Bein short on milk myself an not over much sugar I doctored three of your cans with water which went to make the candles An by the bye I had milk in my coffee for a month to come It s on me Dave McCarthy admitted Tis only that yer me host or I d be shockin the ladies with yer nortorious disgraces But I ll lave ye live this time Dave Come spade the partin guests we must be movin No ye don t ye young laddy buck he interposed as St Vincent started to take Frona down the hill Tis her foster daddy sees her home this night McCarthy laughed in his silent way and offered his arm to Frona while St Vincent joined in the laugh against himself dropped back and joined Miss Mortimer and Baron Courbertin What s this I m hearin about you an Vincent Matt bluntly asked as soon as they had drawn apart from the others He looked at her with his keen gray eyes but she returned the look quite as keenly How should I know what you have been hearing she countered Whin the talk goes round iv a maid an a man the one pretty an the other not unhandsome both young an neither married does it token aught but the one thing Yes An the one thing the greatest thing in all the world Well Frona was the least bit angry and did not feel inclined to help him Marriage iv course he blurted out Tis said it looks that way with the pair of ye But is it said that it is that way Isn t the looks iv it enough he demanded No and you are old enough to know better Mr St Vincent and I we enjoy each other as friends that is all But suppose it is as you say what of it Well McCarthy deliberated there s other talk goes round Tis said Vincent is over thick with a jade down in the town Lucile they speak iv her All of which signifies She waited and McCarthy watched her dumbly I know Lucile and I like her Frona continued filling the gap of his silence and ostentatiously manoeuvring to help him on Do you know her Don t you like her Matt started to speak cleared his throat and halted At last in desperation he blurted out For two cents Frona I d lay ye acrost me knee She laughed You don t dare I m not running barelegged at Dyea Now don t be tasin he blarneyed I m not teasing Don t you like her Lucile An what iv it he challenged brazenly Just what I asked what of it Thin I ll tell ye in plain words from a man old enough to be yer father Tis undacent damnably undacent for a man to kape company with a good young girl Thank you she laughed dropping a courtesy Then she added half in bitterness There have been others who Name me the man he cried hotly There there go on You were saying That it s a crying shame for a man to kape company with with you an at the same time be chake by jowl with a woman iv her stamp And why To come drippin from the muck to dirty yer claneness An ye can ask why But wait Matt wait a moment Granting your premises Little I know iv primises he growled Tis facts I m dalin with Frona bit her lip Never mind Have it as you will but let me go on and I will deal with facts too When did you last see Lucile An why are ye askin he demanded suspiciously Never mind why The fact Well thin the fore part iv last night an much good may it do ye And danced with her A rollickin Virginia reel an not sayin a word iv a quadrille or so Tis at square dances I excel meself Frona walked on in a simulated brown study no sound going up from the twain save the complaint of the snow from under their moccasins Well thin he questioned uneasily An what iv it he insisted after another silence Oh nothing she answered I was just wondering which was the muckiest Mr St Vincent or you or myself with whom you have both been cheek by jowl Now McCarthy was unversed in the virtues of social wisdom and though he felt somehow the error of her position he could not put it into definite thought so he steered wisely if weakly out of danger It s gettin mad ye are with yer old Matt he insinuated who has yer own good at heart an because iv it makes a fool iv himself No I m not But ye are There leaning swiftly to him and kissing him How could I remember the Dyea days and be angry Ah Frona darlin well may ye say it I m the dust iv the dirt under yer feet an ye may walk on me anything save get mad I cud die for ye swing for ye to make ye happy I cud kill the man that gave ye sorrow were it but a thimbleful an go plump into hell with a smile on me face an joy in me heart They had halted before her door and she pressed his arm gratefully I am not angry Matt But with the exception of my father you are the only person I would have permitted to talk to me about this this affair in the way you have And though I like you Matt love you better than ever I shall nevertheless be very angry if you mention it again You have no right It is something that concerns me alone And it is wrong of you To prevint ye walkin blind into danger If you wish to put it that way yes He growled deep down in his throat What is it you are saying she asked That ye may shut me mouth but that ye can t bind me arm But you mustn t Matt dear you mustn t Again he answered with a subterranean murmur And I want you to promise me now that you will not interfere in my life that way by word or deed I ll not promise But you must I ll not Further it s gettin cold on the stoop an ye ll be frostin yer toes the pink little toes I fished splinters out iv at Dyea So it s in with ye Frona girl an good night He thrust her inside and departed When he reached the corner he stopped suddenly and regarded his shadow on the snow Matt McCarthy yer a damned fool Who iver heard iv a Welse not knowin their own mind As though ye d niver had dalin s with the stiff necked breed ye calamitous son iv misfortune Then he
