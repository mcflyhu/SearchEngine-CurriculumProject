The first thing the people in Pollard s big house knew of the return of the two was a voice singing faintly and far off in the stable they could hear it because the door to the big living room was opened And Kate Pollard who had been sitting idly at the piano stood up suddenly and looked around her It did not interrupt the crap game of the four at one side of the room where they kneeled in a close circle But it brought big Pollard himself to the door in time to meet Denver Pete as the latter hurried in When Denver was excited he talked very nearly as softly as he walked And his voice tonight was like a contented humming It worked was all he said aside to Pollard as he came through the door They exchanged silent grips of the hands Then Kate drew down on them as if a mysterious signal had been passed to them by the subdued entrance of Denver the four rose at the side of the room It was Pollard who forced him to talk What happened A pretty little party said Denver His purring voice was so soft that to hear him the others instantly drew close Kate Pollard stood suddenly before him Terry Hollis has done something she said Denver what has he done Him Nothing much To put it in his own words he s just played scavenger for the town and he s done it in a way they won t be forgetting for a good long day Denver Well No need of acting up Kate Who was it Ever meet young Larrimer She shuddered Yes A beast of a man Sure Worse n a beast maybe Well he s carrion now to use Terry s words again Wait a minute cut in big blond Phil Marvin Don t spoil the story for Terry But did he really do for Larrimer Larrimer was a neat one with a gun no good otherwise Did he do for Larrimer echoed Denver in his purring voice Oh man man Did he do for Larrimer And I ain t spoiling his story He won t talk about it Wouldn t open his face about it all the way home A pretty neat play boys Larrimer was looking for a rep and he wanted to make it on Black Jack s son Came tearing in At first Terry tried to sidestep him Made me weak inside for a minute because I thought he was going to take water Then he got riled a bit and then whang It was all over Not a body shot No boys nothing clumsy and amateurish like that because a man may live to empty his gun at you after he s been shot through the body This young Hollis pals just ups and drills Larrimer clean between the eyes If you d measured it off with a ruler you couldn t have hit exact center any better n he done Then he walks up and stirs Larrimer with his toe to make sure he was dead Cool as hell You lie cried the girl suddenly They whirled at her and found her standing and flaming at them You hear me say it Kate said Denver losing a little of his calm He wasn t as cool as that after killing a man He wasn t All right honey Don t you hear him singing out there in the stable Does that sound as if he was cut up much Then you ve made him a murderer you Denver and you Dad Oh if they s a hell you re going to travel there for this Both of you As if we had anything to do with it exclaimed Denver innocently Besides it wasn t murder It was plain self defense Nothing but that Three witnesses to swear to it But my my you should hear that town rave They thought nobody could beat Larrimer The girl slipped back into her chair again and sat with her chin in her hand brooding It was all impossible it could not be Yet there was Denver telling his story and far away the clear baritone of Terry Hollis singing as he cared for El Sangre She waited to make sure waited to see his face and hear him speak close at hand Presently the singing rang out more clearly He had stepped out of the barn Oh I am a friar of orders gray Through hill and valley I take my way My long bead roll I merrily chant Wherever I wander no money I want And as the last word rang through the room Terry Hollis stood in the doorway with his saddle and bridle hanging over one strong arm and his gun and gun belt in the other hand And his voice came cheerily to them in greeting It was impossible more impossible than ever He crossed the room hung up his saddle and found her sitting near What should he say How would his color change In what way could he face her with that stain in his soul And this was what Terry said to her I m going to teach El Sangre to let you ride him Kate By the Lord I wish you d been with us going down the hill this morning No shame no downward head no remorse And he was subtly and strangely changed She could not put the difference into words But his eye seemed larger and brighter it was no longer possible for her to look deeply into it as she had done so easily the night before And there were other differences He held his head in a more lordly fashion About every movement there was a singular ease and precision He walked with a lighter step and with a catlike softness almost as odd as that of Denver His step had been light before but it was not like this But through him and about him there was an air of uneasy alert happiness as of one who steals a few perfect moments knowing that they will not be many A great pity welled in her and a great anger It was the anger which showed Terry Hollis what have you done You re lookin me in the eye but you ought to be hangin your head You ve done murder Murder Murder She let the three words ring through the room like three blows cutting the talk to silence And all save Terry seemed moved He was laughing down at her actually laughing and there was no doubt as to the sincerity of that mirth His presence drew her and repelled her she became afraid for the first time in her life A little formality with a gun he said calmly A dog got in my way Kate a mad dog I shot the beast to keep it from doing harm Ah Terry I know everything I ve heard Denver tell it I know it was a man Terry He insisted carelessly By the Lord Kate only a dog and a mad dog at that Perhaps there was the body of a man but there was the soul of a dog inside the skin Tut it isn t worth talking about She drew away from him Terry God pity you I pity you she went on hurriedly and faintly But you ain t the same any more Terry I I m almost afraid of you He tried laughingly to stop her and in a sudden burst of hysterical terror she fled from him Out of the corner of her eye she saw him come after her light as a shadow And the shadow leaped between her and the door the force of her rush drove her into his arms In the distance she could hear the others laughing they understood such a game as this and enjoyed it with all their hearts Ah the fools He held her lightly his fingertips under her elbows For all the delicacy of that touch she knew that if she attempted to flee the grip would be iron He would hold her where she was until he was through talking to her Don t you see what I ve done he was saying rapidly You wanted to drive me out last night You said I didn t fit that I didn t belong up here Well Kate I started out today to make myself fit to belong to this company of fine fellows He laughed a little if it were not real mirth at least there was a fierce quality of joy in his voice You see I decided that if I went away I d be lonely Particularly I d be lonely as the devil Kate for you You ve murdered to make yourself one of us Tush Kate You exaggerate entirely Do you know what I ve really done Why I ve wakened I ve come to my senses After all there was no other place for me to go I tried the world of good ordinary working people I asked them to let me come in and prove my right to be one of them They discharged me when I worked honestly on the range They sent their professional gunmen and bullies after me And then I reached the limit of my endurance Kate and I struck back And the mockery of it all is this that though they have struck me repeatedly and I have endured it I having struck back a single time am barred from among them forever Let it be so Hush Terry I I m going to think of ways You couldn t Last night yes Today I m a man and I m free And freedom is the sweetest thing in the world There s no place else for me to go This is my world You re my queen I ve won my spurs I ll use them in your service Kate Stop Terry By the Lord I will though I m happy don t you see And I m going to be happier I m going to work my way along until I can tell you that I love you Kate that you re the daintiest body of fire and beauty and temper and gentleness and wisdom and fun that was ever crowned with the name of a woman And But under the rapid fire of his words there was a touch of hardness mockery perhaps She drew back and he stepped instantly aside She went by him through the door with bowed head And Terry closing it after her heard the first sob contented adj He won t be contented until he s upset everyone in
