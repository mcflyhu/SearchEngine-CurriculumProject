As the taxi rolled up to her corner I saw that the windows of her floor were bright She was still up which would make things easier much better than having to wake her from her sleep In that sort of apartment they lock the outer doors at half past ten and to get at the bells you have to wake the janitor which I didn t want to do as no one must know I d been there So before I rang the outside bell that connects with his lair in the basement I tried the door hoping some late comer had left it on the jar as they sometimes do It opened an immense piece of luck which made me feel that fate was on my side and braced me like a tonic In the vestibule I pressed the button under her letter box and in a minute came the click click of the inner latch and I entered As I ascended the stairs I heard the door on the landing above softly open and looking up I saw a bright light illumine the dimness and then through the balustrade her figure standing on the threshold She must have been surprised for the person who mounted into her sight a girl in a dark coat and hat was someone she d never seen before She pushed the door wider as if to let more light on me looking puzzled at my face The one electric bulb was just above her on the wall and its sickly gleam fell over her tall and straight in a purple silk kimono Her black hair curling back from her forehead stood out like a frame and her neck between the folds of the kimono was as smooth and white as cream The sight of her instead of weakening me gave me strength for in that sort of careless rig tired and pale she was still handsome enough to make a fool of any man Do you want to see me she said Miss Whitehall I do I answered I want to see you on a matter of importance It can t wait Without another word she drew back from the doorway and let me come in Go in there she said pointing up the hall to the curtained entrance of the dining room and I went as she pointed The room was brightly lit as was the parlor beyond and on every side were the signs of moving curtains piled below the windows furniture in white covers straw and bits of paper on the floor Two trunks were standing in the middle of the parlor and on the chairs about were her clothes all tumbled and mixed up boots in one place hats in another lingerie heaped on the table There was enough packing to keep her busy till morning and I thought to myself that was what she intended to do finish it up tonight and the next day make her move All this took only a minute to see and I was standing by the dining table clutching tight on my muff to hide the trembling of my hands when she came in In the brighter light I could see that she looked worn and weary all her color gone except for the red of her lips and her eyes sunken and dark underneath What do you want with me she said as the curtain fell behind her Her manner was abrupt and straight from the shoulder like a person s who s got past little pleasantnesses and politeness The glance she fixed on me was steady and clear but there was a sort of waiting expectation in it like she was ready for anything and braced to meet it I came I said choosing my words as careful as I could to tell you of of something that s going to happen to warn you She gave a start and her face changed as if a spring inside her had snapped and sort of focussed her whole being into a still breathless listening Warn me she repeated Of what Miss Whitehall I said clearing my throat for it was dry I m a person you don t know but I know you I ve been employed by people here in New York who ve been watching you for the past few weeks They ve got the evidence they want I ve been helping them and they re ready to act As I had spoken she had never taken her eyes off me Big and black and unwinking they stared and as I stared back I could see it wasn t surprise or fear they showed but a concentrated attention What do you mean act in what way Get you to their office tomorrow and question you about the Harland case and make you confess She was as still as a statue You d have thought she was turned to stone but for the moving up and down of her chest What am I to confess What have I done My hands gripped together in my muff and my voice went down to my boots for I couldn t say it aloud Been a party to the murder of Hollings Harland When I said it I had an expectation that she d say something deny it in some violent way that would make me think she was innocent Maybe Jack Reddy had influenced me but I wanted it I looked for it I hoped for it and I was disappointed If it had been a shock to her if she hadn t known there d been a murder she would never have behaved as she did For she said not a word standing stock still her face chalk white even the red fading from her lips and her eyes fixed on the wall opposite like the eyes of a sleep walker The murder of Hollings Harland she whispered and it was more as if she was speaking to herself than to me Yes I went on They ve discovered it a group of us have been working in secret following the clues and gathering the evidence Now we ve got it all ready and tomorrow they expect to arrest you She suddenly sank down into a chair by the table her hands braced against its edge her eyes riveted in that strange mesmerized stare on the fern plant in front of her When did they discover it she said in a low voice Not long after it happened but that doesn t matter They ve got everything in their hands Even if you insist that you re innocent they ve got enough to arrest you on You ve been under surveillance all along they ve been shadowing you They followed you that time you tried to go to Toronto I knew that she said in the same low voice as if she was talking to herself They know how you came out of the building that night not by the elevator as you said but by the stairs and how you didn t get home till nearly eight They know about you and Barker She lifted her head and said quickly What do they know about me and Barker That he was in love with you and you with him Oh that Her tone was indifferent as if the point was a matter of no consequence They know how the murder was done How you and Barker did it Barker and I She sank back in her chair then suddenly leaning across the table looked into my face and said Tell me how we did it Let me see what they know I took the chair opposite and told her the whole plot and how we d worked it out While I was doing it she never said a word but sat with her profile toward me and her eyes in that blank motionless stare on the fern plant When I had finished there was a pause then suddenly she drew a deep breath turned toward me and said What brought you here to me tonight It came so unexpectedly I had no answer ready What I d looked for was a scene terror maybe hysterics and her breaking away as fast as she could put on her hat Seeing me stupidly dumb she rose out of her chair and moved away for a few steps then stopped and seemed again to fall into that trance of thinking It was like everything else in this nightmare different to what I d looked for and a sickening thought came to me that maybe she was ready to throw up the sponge and go down and confess And then for all I knew Jack Reddy might persuade her to marry him and go to prison with her How can you be sure what a man crazy with love will do If she got a life sentence he d probably live at the gates of Sing Sing for the rest of his days I was desperate and went round the table after her Say I implored What are you going to do I m thinking she muttered For God s sake don t think I wailed Get up and act If I go back on the people that employ me and come here in the middle of the night to warn you isn t it the least you can do to take advantage of it and go She wheeled round on me her face all alight with a wonderful beaming look That s the reason she said That s what made you come humanity pity You ve risked everything to help me Oh you don t know what you ve done what courage you ve put into me And you don t know what my gratitude is Before I knew it she had seized hold of one of my hands and held it against her heart with her head bowed over it as if she was praying Do you guess how I felt Ashamed perishing with it ready to sink down on the floor and pass away A murderess no doubt but even if a murderess thinks you did her a good turn when you didn t it makes you feel like a snake s a high class animal beside you Oh come on I begged Let go of me and get out She dropped my hand and looked at me Oh so soft and sweet and I saw tears in her eyes That pretty near finished me and I wailed out Don t stop to cry You don t know but what they might get uneasy and come tonight Put on your things and go Hadn t I got to hurry her If Jack made a quick trip he d be back in town between two and three and he d come as straight as wheels could take him to her door Yes I ll go she said Now I urged as soon as you can get into your coat and hat Don t bother about this I pointed to the disorder round us They ll think you ve had another message from Barker and gone to him A curious slight smile came over her face Yes she said that s what they will think I suppose Of course it is and they ll waste time looking for him which ll give you a good start If there s no train now to the place you re going to sit in the depot ride round in a taxi walk up and down Fifth Avenue only get out of this place I ll be gone in half an hour she said and moved between the trunks and piled up clothes to the bedroom beyond I followed her and saw into the room all confusion like the others every gas in the chandelier blazing Can I help you I said Can I pack a suitcase or anything No she halted in front of the mirror letting the kimono slide off her to the floor her arms and neck like shining marble under that blaze of light I ll only want a few things There s a bag there I can throw them into You d better go now I was afraid she d not be as quick as I wanted but I couldn t hang round urging any more after she d told me to go Besides I could see she was hurrying grabbing a dress from the bed and getting into it so swiftly even I was satisfied Well then I m off I said She looked up from the hooks she was snapping together and said Before you go tell me who you are There s no need for that I answered thinking she d probably never see me again I m just someone that blew in tonight for a minute and who s going like she came Someone I ll never forget she said and that some day if all goes well I ll be able to pay back I was afraid she was going to get grateful again and I couldn t stand any more of that So with a quick good bye away I went up the hall opening the door without a sound and stealing down the stairs as soft as a robber Out in the street I stopped and reconnoitered There was no one in sight except a policeman lounging dreary on the next corner Across from the apartment was the entrance of a little shop tobacco and light literature and into that I crept squeezing back against the glass door I couldn t be at peace till I saw her leave and for fifteen or twenty minutes I stood there watching the lights in her windows Then suddenly they began to go out across the front and along down the side till every pane was black A few minutes later she came down the steps carrying a bag She stopped close to where I was and hailed a car and not till I saw it start with her sitting by the door did I steal out of my hiding place and sprint up the street to Madison Avenue When I reached home I was shivering and wild eyed for if Babbitts was there what could I say to him He wasn t thank Heaven and cold as ice feeling as if I d been through a mangle I crawled into bed There wasn t much sleep for me that night About all I could say to myself was that I d saved Jack But the others Oh the others I couldn t get them out of my mind They d come in a procession across the dark and look at me sad and reproachful Mr Whitney who d done everything in the world for me and Mr George who could put on such side but had always been so kind and cordial and O Mally who d told Babbitts the case was going to make him and Babbitts Oh Babbitts I rolled over on the pillow and cried scalding bitter tears It wasn t only the scoop it was that I d have a secret from him forever him that up to now had known every thought in my mind had been like the other half of me They say virtue is its own reward and I ve always believed it But that night I had the awful thought that maybe I d done wrong for all the reward I got was to feel like an outcast with a stone for
