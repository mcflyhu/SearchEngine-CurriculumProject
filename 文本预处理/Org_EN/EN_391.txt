Lord Evelyn Urquhart dined with his nephew on the last evening in February It was a characteristic Urquhart dinner party the guests were mostly cheerful well bred young people of high spirits and of the worldly station that is not much concerned with any aspect of money but the spending of it High living plain thinking agreeable manners and personal appearance plenty of humour enough ability to make a success of the business of living and not enough to agitate the brain a light tread along a familiar and well laid road and a serene blindness to side tracks and alleys not familiar nor well laid and to those that walked thereon these were the characteristics of the pleasant people who frequented Denis Urquhart s pleasant house in Park Lane Lucy was among them small and pale and rather silent and intensely alive She of course was a native not of Park Lane but of Chelsea and the people who had frequented her home there were of a different sort They had had mostly a different kind of brain a kind more restless and troublesome and untidy and a different type of wit more pungent and ironic less well fed and hilarious and they were less well dressed and agreeable to look at and had perhaps higher thoughts though how shall one measure height and ate certainly plainer food for lack of richer These were the people Lucy knew Her father himself had been of these She now found her tent pitched among the prosperous and the study of them touched her wide gaze with a new pondering look Denis hadn t any use for cranks None of his set were socialists vegetarians Quakers geniuses anarchists drunkards poets anti breakfasters or anti hatters none of them in fine the sort of person Lucy was used to They never pawned their watches or walked down Bond Street in Norfolk coats They had no doubt their hobbies but they were suitable well bred hobbies that did not obtrude vulgarly on other people s notice Peter had once said that if he were a plutocrat he would begin to dream dreams Lucy supposed that the seemingly undreaming people who were Denis s friends were not rich enough they hadn t reached plutocracy where romance resides but merely prosperity which has fewer possibilities Lucy began in these days to ponder on the exceeding evil of Socialism which the devil has put it into certain men s hearts to desire For thought Lucy sweep away the romantic rich sweep away the dreaming destitute and what have you left The prosperous the comfortable the serenely satisfied the sanely reasonable Dives with his purple and fine linen his sublime outlook over a world he may possess at a touch goes to his own place Lazarus with his wallet for crusts and his place among the dogs and his sharp wonder at the world s black heart is gathered to his fathers there remain the sanitary dwellings of the comfortable the monotonous external adequacy that touches no man s inner needs the lifeless rigour of a superintended well being Decidedly thought Lucy siding with the Holy Roman Church a scheme of the devil s Denis and his friends also thought it was rot So no doubt it was Denis belonged to the Conservative party Lucy thought parties funny things and laughed Though she had of late taken to wandering far into seas of thought so that her wide forehead was often puckered as she sat silent she still laughed at the world Perhaps the more one thinks about it the more one laughs the height and depth of its humour are certainly unfathomable On this last night of February Lord Evelyn when the other guests had gone put his unsteady white hand under Lucy s chin and raised her small pale face and looked at it out of his near sighted scrutinising eyes and said Humph You re thinner Lucy s eyes laughed up at him Am I I suppose I m growing old You re worrying What s it about asked Lord Evelyn They were in the library Lord Evelyn and Denis sat by the fire in leather chairs and smoked and Lucy sat on a hassock between them her chin in her hands She was silent for a moment Then she looked up at Denis who was reading Punch and said I ve had a letter from Peggy Margerison this morning Denis gave a sound between a grunt and a chuckle The grunt element was presumably for Peggy Margerison the chuckle for Punch Lord Evelyn tapping his eye glass on the arm of his chair said Well Well impatiently nervously Lucy drew a note from her pocket she was never pocketless and spread it on her knees It was a long letter on crinkly paper written in a large dashing sprawling hand full of curls generosities extravagances She says said Lucy Please listen Denis that that they want money I somehow thought that would be what she said Denis murmured still half preoccupied I m sure she s right A woman who writes a hand like that put in Lord Evelyn will always spend more than she has A hole in the purse a hole in the purse She says went on Lucy looking through the letter with wrinkled forehead that they re all very hard up indeed Of course I knew that I can see it whenever I go there only Peter will never take more than silly little clothes and things for Thomas And now Peggy says they re in great straits Thomas is going to teethe or something and wants better milk all from one cow and they re all awfully in debt I should fancy that was chronic remarked Denis turning to Essence of Parliament A hole in the purse a hole in the purse muttered Lord Evelyn tapping with his eye glass Peggy says that Peter won t ask for help himself but he s let her it seems And their boarders are nearly all gone one of them quite suddenly without paying a sixpence for all the time he was there I suppose he didn t think he d had sixpence worth said Denis He was probably right And Thomas is still very delicate after his bronchitis and Peter s got a bad cold on the chest and wants more cough mixture than they can afford to buy and they owe money to the butcher and the fishmonger and the baker and the doctor and the tailor and Hilary s lost his latest job and isn t earning anything at all So I suppose Peter is keeping the family Scamps scamps all muttered Lord Evelyn Deserve all they get and more People like the Margerisons an t worth helping They d best go under at once best go under Swindlers and scamps the lot of them I daresay the woman s stories are half lies of course they want money but it s probably only to spend on nonsense Why can t they keep themselves like decent people Oh said Lucy dismissing that as absurd they can t Of course they can t They never could Denis Lucy Denis absently put out a hand to meet hers How much shall we give them Denis Denis dropped Punch onto the floor and lay back with his hands clasped behind his fair head Lucy looking at his up turned foreshortened cleanly modelled face thought with half of her mind what a perfect thing it was Sudden aspects of Denis s beauty sometimes struck her breathless as they struck Peter The Margerison family wants money I understand said Denis who hadn t been listening attentively Very badly Denis Denis nodded They always do of course Well is it our business to fill the bottomless Margerison purse Lucy sat very still looking up at him with wide eyes Our business I don t know But of course if Peter and Peter s people want anything we shall give it them But I gather it s not Peter that asks Peter never asks does he No said Lucy Peter never asks Not even for Thomas Well I should be inclined to trust Peter rather than his charming family Peter s name seems to be dragged into that letter a good deal but it doesn t follow that Peter sanctioned it I m not going to annoy Peter by sending him what he s never asked for I should think probably Peter knows they can get on all right as they are and that this letter must be taken with a good deal of salt I expect the egregious Hilary only wants the money for some new enterprise of his own that will fail as usual Anyhow I really don t fancy having any further dealings with Hilary Margerison or his wife I ve had enough there He s the most impossible cad and swindler Swindlers all swindlers all said Lord Evelyn getting up and pacing up and down the room his hands behind his back Lucy after a moment said simply I shall give them something Denis I must Don t you see Whoever it was I would Because anyhow they re poor and we re rich and they want things we can give them It s so obvious that when people ask one for things they must have them if one can give them And when it s Peter who s in want and Peter s baby and Peter s people You see said Denis I doubt about Peter or the baby benefiting by anything we give them It will all go down the drain where Hilary Margerison s money flows away Give it to Peter or give it to his relations it ll come to the same thing Peter gives them every penny he gets I don t doubt You know what Peter is he s as weak as a baby in his step brother s hands he lets himself be dragged into the most disgraceful transactions because he can t say no Lucy looked up at him open eyed pale quiet You think of Peter like that she said and her voice trembled a little Lord Evelyn stopped in his walk and listened I m sorry Lucy said Denis throwing away his cigar end I don t want to say anything against Peter to you But one must judge by facts you know I don t mean that Peter means any harm but as I say he s weak I m fond of Peter you know I wish to goodness he wouldn t play the fool as he does mixing himself up with his precious relations and helping them in their idiotic schemes for swindling money out of people but there it is he will do it and as long as he does it I don t feel moved to have much to do with him I should send him money if he asked me personally of course even if I knew it would only go into his brother s pocket but I m not going to do it at his sister in law s command If you ask me whether I feel inclined to help Hilary Margerison and his wife my answer is simply no I don t They re merely scum and why should one have anything to do with scum Lucy looked at him silently for a while Then she said slowly I see Yes I see you wouldn t want to of course They are scum And you re not But I am I think I belong to the same sort of people they do I could swindle and cheat too I expect It s the people at the bottom who do that They re my relations you see not yours My dear Lucy only Peter is your relation Peter and Thomas And I count the rest too because they re Peter s So let me do all that is to be done Denis Don t you bother I ll take them money Let them alone Lucy You d better you know What s the good I don t know said Lucy None I expect None at all because Peter wouldn t take it from me without you She came a little nearer him and put her hand on his knee like a wistful puppy Denis she said I wish you would They know already that I care But I wish you would Peter d like you to He d be more pleased than if I did much more Peter cares for you and me and Thomas extraordinarily much and you can t compare carings but the way he cares for you is the most wonderful of all I believe If you went to him if you showed him you cared he d take it from you He wouldn t take it from me without you because he d suspect you weren t wanting him to have it Denis won t you go to Peter as you used to do long ago before he was in disgrace and poor before he was scum Can t you Denis Denis had coloured faintly He always did when people were emotional Lucy seldom was she had a delicious morning freshness that was like the cool wind on the hills in spring Peter never comes here Lucy does he If he wanted to see me I suppose he would Lucy was looking strangely at the beautiful face with the faint flush rising in it She apparently thought no reply necessary to his words but said again Can t you Denis Or is it too hard too much bother too much stepping out of the way Oh it s not the bother of course But but I really don t see anything to be gained by it that s the fact Our meetings on the last few occasions when we have met haven t been particularly comfortable I don t think Peter likes them any better than I do One can t force intercourse Lucy if it doesn t run easily and smoothly it had better be left alone There have been things between us between Peter s family and my family that can t be forgotten or put aside by either of us I suppose and I don t think Peter wants to be reminded of them by seeing me any more than I do by seeing him It s it s so beastly uncomfortable you know he added boyishly ruffling up his hair with his hand and concluded didactically People must drift apart if their ways lie in quite different spheres it s inevitable Denis who had a boyish reticence had expanded and explained himself more than usual Lucy s hand dropped from his knee on to her own I suppose it is inevitable she said beneath her breath I suppose the distance is too great Tis such a long long way from here to there such a long long way Good night Denis I m going to bed She got up slowly cramped and tired and pale It was not till she was on her feet that she saw Lord Evelyn sitting in the background and remembered his presence She had forgotten him she had been thinking only of Denis and Peter and herself She didn t know if he had been listening much he sat quietly nursing his knee saying nothing But when Lucy had gone he said to Denis You re right Denis you re utterly right not to have anything to do with those swindlers and as if in a sudden fresh anger against them he began again his quick uneven pacing down the room False through and through he muttered False through and through Lucy s face as she had risen to her feet and said Good night Uncle Evelyn had been so like Peter s as he had last seen it when Peter had passed him in the doorway at Astleys that it had taken his breath away agitate
