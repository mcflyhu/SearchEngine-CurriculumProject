With the fitting of the murder on Johnston Barker the office of Whitney Whitney drew in its breath took a cinch in its belt and went at the work with a quiet deadly zest It was the most sensational and one of the biggest cases that had ever come their way No one on the inside could have failed to feel the thrill of it the horror of the crime and the excitement of the subterranean chase for the criminal I was as keen as the rest of them but there was one feature of the secret investigations that I detested the dragging in of Carol Whitehall s name It couldn t be helped The affair had taken place in her offices but it was hateful to me to hear her mentioned in our conferences even though it was merely as an outside figure a person as ignorant of the true state of the case as Troop or Mrs Hansen The tapped phone message and the subsequent trip to Rochester had given me no end of a jar Up till then I couldn t imagine her as caring for Barker Everybody admitted that his private life had been beyond reproach entirely free from entanglements with women but even so I couldn t picture the girl I d met in New Jersey in love with him He was between fifty and sixty more than twice her age George said it was his money but George has lived among the fashionable rich women who d marry an octogenarian for a house on Fifth Avenue and a string of pearls I would have staked my last dollar she wasn t that kind proud and pure as Diana only giving herself where her heart went first But if it had been hard to imagine her as fond of Barker the magnate what was it now when he was Barker the murderer It made me sick All I could hope for was that we d get him and save the unfortunate girl by showing her what he was And while we were doing this it was up to us to keep her out of it shield her and protect her in every possible way She was a lady the kind of woman that every man wants to keep aloof from anything sordid and brutal I was thinking this one morning a few days after our last s ance on my way to the office I had been detained on work uptown and was late entering upon a conference of the chief George and O Mally When I heard what they d been evolving I didn t show the expected enthusiasm Miss Whitehall was to be asked to come to Whitney Whitney s that afternoon the hope being to trap or beguile her into some information about Barker s whereabouts It was the chief s plan a poor one I thought and said so but he was as enigmatic as usual remarking that whether it succeeded or not he wanted to see her It didn t add to my good humor to hear that as I knew the girl they d selected me for their messenger Not being able to strike straight at their subject they d framed up a story one that would give them scope for questions and be a sufficiently plausible excuse to get her there It seemed to me absurd but the old man was satisfied with it Everybody now knew that Harland had been her silent partner Their story was that they d heard Barker was also in the enterprise she d had a double backing his visits to her office gave color to the rumor and so forth and so on I left the office while they were conning it over As I mounted the stairs to her apartment I felt a good deal of a cad If it had been anyone else or any other kind of a woman but that fine high spirited creature A group of men trying to make a fool of her beastly Why had I said I d do it and why the devil had she got mixed up in such an ugly business A servant opened the door and showed me up a hall into the parlor She was there sitting at a desk littered with papers and rose with a faint surprised smile when she saw me As we sat down and I made my apologies for intruding I had a chance to observe her and was struck by the change in her It was less than a year since we d last met and she looked singularly different Handsome of course she d always be that but another kind of woman At first I thought it was because she was paler and thinner she d been a radiant blooming Amazon in the country but after a few minutes I saw it was something how can I express it more of the spirit than the body The joyousness and gayety had gone out of her and the spontaneity I noticed that especially I could feel constraint in her composure as if she was on her dignity As I explained my mission I couldn t say much and felt beastly uncomfortable while I was doing it she listened with an expressionless polite attention When I had finished she made no comment merely saying she would be only too happy to do anything for Mr Whitney then passed on to her own affairs mentioning the failure of the Azalea Woods Estates and that she thought she and her mother would return to the country I was on the verge of offering to finance her in a new deal and then remembered I was there as an emissary not as a friend It rattled me and the rattling wasn t helped when I met her eyes brown and soft but with something scrutinizing and watchful under their velvety darkness I stayed longer than I meant to longer than I needed to Some way or other our talk shifted round to Azalea and Longwood to Firehill and the people we knew all through there I forgot about the matter I d come on and she brightened up too and there was a gleam of the girl I d met a year ago But when I rose to leave the other woman was back the reserved poised woman who seemed shut in a shell of conventional politeness She said she d come that afternoon about five she had work to do that would keep her till then In the doorway she suddenly smiled and held out her hand The feel of it soft and warm was in mine when I got out into the street I went back to the office feeling meaner than a yellow dog Thank Heaven I d not have to do that again They d get all they could out of her and that would be the last time Whitney Whitney would want to see her Later on in a week or two maybe I could call on her again The ice was broken and anyway I didn t see but what it was my duty Someone ought to help her to get on her feet again and as she d no man in her own family the least I could do was to offer my services At five the chief George and I were waiting for her She was a little late and as she came in I noticed that she had more color than she d had in the morning She looked splendid in a dark fur coat and some kind of a close fitting hat with her black hair curling out below the edge Her manner was cool and tranquil not a hint about her of surprise or uneasiness only that heightened color which I set down to the hurry she d been in getting there The chief was as gracious as if he d been welcoming her as a guest in his house full of apologies waving her to an armchair suggesting she take off her coat as the room was warm No outsider would ever have guessed what was going on in that astute and subtle mind A feeling of indignant pity rose in me she seemed so unsuspecting But No it s better for me to describe the scene as it occurred to try and make you see it as I did When the necessary politenesses were disposed of the old man very delicately with all his tact and finesse started on the frame up He did it admirably finishing on a sort of confidential note As the attorney for the Copper Pool group it would facilitate matters if he knew of all Barker s activities any information the slightest would be helpful She answered readily without surprise almost as if she might have heard the story before You ve been misinformed Mr Whitney Mr Barker had no interest in the Azalea Woods Estates He had nothing to do with it The old man pursed out his lips and raised his brows I see one of those groundless rumors that gather about a sensational event It probably started from the fact mentioned in the papers that Barker was in your office that afternoon Probably He came to see me about a house he was going to build in the tract Of course that s all ended in nothing now He looked at her from under his bushy brows a kind fatherly glance I was very sorry to hear Miss Whitehall that you were one of the sufferers in this double disaster we are trying to settle Oh I she gave a slight shrug of her shoulders I m wiped out Tch he shook his head frowning and resentful These men can knife each other pirates in a buccaneer warfare but when it comes to dragging down women I d like to see them all strung up Her eyes gave a flash It was like a spark struck from a flint there and then gone As if it had surprised her and she was determined to guard against its return the calm of her face intensified into an almost mask like quiet She answered softly I can t go so far as that Mr Whitney I m sure there s some explanation as to Mr Barker I mean I hope so said the chief for your sake if for no other I hope he ll come back and make the restitution he owes his associates and discharge that obligation about the house and lot He looked at her smiling a rallying smile that said as plain as words he knew such hopes to be groundless She did not smile back simply raised her eyebrows and gave a slight nod George who was facing her leaned forward and said as if he had just met her at a pink tea and was being gallantly sympathetic It was rather hard on you Miss Whitehall having those two men in your place that day The press must have made your life a burden It wasn t so bad Some reporters called me up but when they found how little I knew they left me alone I hadn t anything exciting to say Both interviews were nothing but business But let me ask you a question not for publication this time just as a thing I m curious about It was only a few hours after you saw him that Harland killed himself Wasn t there anything unusual in his manner anything to suggest that he was not himself She looked down at the purse she was holding in her lap and said slowly clasping and unclasping the catch I didn t notice anything unless perhaps he was a little irritable and nervous I certainly never would have thought he was in the state of a man contemplating suicide And you would have known said the chief He turned to George in explanation As Harland s partner Miss Whitehall would have known him well enough to notice any marked change in him I was watching her closely and as the glances of the two men met I saw uneasiness well up through the quietude of her face Then for the first time I suspected that she was not as composed as she seemed Her words confirmed the suspicion they came quickly in hurried denial No I didn t know him well I saw him very seldom We were not in the least what what you d call friends or even close acquaintances It was all purely business The chief nodded a slight Mandarin like teetering of his head which gave the impression of a polite agreement in a matter that didn t interest him Purely business he murmured then again turned to George What Miss Whitehall says would bear out the general idea that it was that last interview which drove Harland to desperation As they spoke she looked from one to the other a glance that passed over both faces as quick as a lightning flash Before they could turn it was gone and her eyes had a dense dead look as if she had dropped some inner veil over them Then I knew that the brain behind that smooth white forehead was something more than alert it was on its guard wary and watchful The knowledge made me suddenly speak I wanted to see I had to see if that careful control would hold under a direct question about her lover How about Barker How did he act when you saw him that afternoon She shifted slightly to see me better Oh perfectly naturally There was nothing in the least unusual about him Barker was a man of iron said the chief His mental disturbances didn t show on the outside Besides he gave a wave of his hand toward her this young lady knew him only slightly He turned quickly to her I m right am I not Perfectly she fixed her eyes on him and kept them there black and unfathomable My acquaintance with him was simply that of an agent with a customer For a moment I couldn t look at her I got up and going to the window fumbled with the blind The man she d tried to run away with and telling her lie with that smooth steadiness It was only love could give such nerve Behind me I heard the old man s voice A horrible affair It was fortunate for you you escaped the sight of it Ah it was a sound of shuddering protest that would have been too much I knew nothing of it till I saw the papers the next morning It made me ill I was at home for several days Well said he I m in hopes we re going to straighten things out before long I turned from the window and moved back wondering what he was going to say She was looking again at her purse snapping and unsnapping the clasp How can you do that she asked Haven t you read in the papers that Barker s been seen in Philadelphia Ah yes she murmured her glance still on the purse But nobody s found him yet Give us time give us time These vanishing gentlemen like a change of air They don t stay long under our hospitable flag Their goal is Canada For a moment she had no reply You could see it you could see the effort with which she held her statue calm pose but a deep breath lifted her breast and the edge of her teeth showed on her underlip Canada said the old man with a comfortable roll in his big chair is our modern American equivalent of the medieval sanctuary She d got her nerve back I never saw such grit She gave him a smile not jolly like his but defiant Of course she said a sort of Cave of Adullum Then she rose and looking at him from under her eyelids added But if a man s clever enough to get to the Cave of Adullum I should think he d be too clever to stay there She turned and took her coat from the chair back George made a jump to help her and the old man heaved himself up breaking out with renewed apologies for the trouble he d given her They were like people separating after a social function he bland and courteous she gracious and deprecating If I could be of any service to you I d be only too glad But she gave that little shrug of her shoulders I m so unimportant A poor working woman whose orbit happened by chance to cross those of two great luminaries There s nothing for anybody to do but us said George standing behind her and holding out her coat And we ll do it You ll see some morning in the paper that we ve got our hands on Barker the high class sneak He and his father worked so well together that he told me afterward he knew the old man would be watching her He was and so was I and at those words I saw the rich color spread to her forehead and again that flash like a leap of flame shine in her eyes She knew it too and dropped her lids over it but the color she couldn t control and it glowed in crimson on her cheeks as she answered with a sort of soft tolerance Oh Mr Whitney hunting criminals has made you unjust Then as the coat slipped on she flashed a look at him over her shoulder But I don t think it s real The profession requires a pose George was quite bowled over He had no answer and she knew it turning from him with a smile and moving toward the door Halfway there the old man stopped her Oh by the way one thing more that nearly slipped my memory You no doubt saw in the papers that Harland is supposed to have spent the half hour before he jumped in the corridor of your floor Did you see him there as you left I mean I she raised her eyebrows in artless surprised query No I d gone before he came down I left about six or maybe a little before Um he nodded You were probably in the elevator Yes probably her purse dropped from her hand to the floor We all started forward to pick it up but she was too quick for us and had it before any of us could reach it As she righted herself from the sudden stoop her face was deeply flushed Yes of course I must have been in the elevator she finished with a slight gasp as if the quick movement had impeded her breathing I see of course agreed the chief moving beside her to the door It merely interested me as a student of morbid psychology I d like to have known how a man of Harland s type looked moved comported himself while such a struggle went on in his mind At the door there were general good byes a very cordial parting all round I slipped out behind her to escort her through the hall to the elevator As we brushed along side by side she said nothing and glimpsing down at her face I saw it set in a still pondering sphinx like it seemed to me Waiting for the car I said a few civil commonplaces to which she made short conventional answers Biting her lip her eyes on the ground she looked preoccupied impatient I thought for the car to come I wanted to ask her if I could see her again but I didn t dare she seemed so indifferent so shut away in her own brooding But when she entered the elevator and the gate shut I saw her through the grill work looking at me from behind that iron barrier and the sight stirred me like a hand clasped on my heart It wasn t only the expression of her face which was sad almost tragic but it was a strange and eerie suggestion that it was like a face looking through the bars of a prison The thought haunted me as I walked back In the office George and the chief were talking over the interview They d noted every tone of her voice every change of her color That she d lied had not surprised them She had had to lie Must love the old rascal to death George commented The chief rose lumberingly and moved to his cigar box on the mantelpiece I understand now why Barker who never was known to care for a woman finally fell She s a splendid creature brains and beauty Both to burn George agreed You couldn t get much out of her All I wanted just now said his father striking a match the rest ll come in time I was just going to ask him what more he expected when a clerk opened the door and said Mrs Babbitts is outside to see Mr Whitney The chief squared round like a flash the lit match dropping to the hearth His face usually heavy and stolid lit into an almost avid eagerness Show her in he ordered and the clerk disappeared What are you expecting to get from Molly George asked Isn t she finished Not quite The old man s eyes were on the door his cigar unlit in his hand I hadn t often seen him so openly on the qui vive Molly s had further orders What You ll see was the answer Molly entered with the cold of the night still around her Her long coat was buttoned wrong her hat on one side Haste was written all over her haste and that bright eyed jubilant exhilaration that took possession of her when things were moving her way She was like a little game dog on the scent and I d often heard the old man say she d make the best woman detective he d ever known He was awfully fond of her and took a sort of paternal pride in her nerve and cleverness just as he did in George s Well Molly he said got that stuff for me She nodded her little body seeming to radiate a quivering energy Today at the lunch hour I came the minute I got off Go ahead I said not to tell anybody till you told me first Well you re going to tell me first now Standing by the table her eyes bright on the old man she said slowly and clearly Troop says he never took Miss Whitehall down from her offices on the night of January the fifteenth George gave a smothered ejaculation and started forward I was transfixed not believing my ears Only the chief looked unmoved leaning against the mantelpiece holding Molly s glance with his Go on he growled He says that he was there later than usual until eight because of the accident and the other car being broken Before that he took down the two Azalea Woods Estates clerks Iola Barry and Tony Ford but not Miss Whitehall After the accident he ran out into the street and when he came back the people were on every landing ringing the bells and wild because the elevator didn t come He went up and took them off but Miss Whitehall wasn t among them He said that he d heard some of them got tired of waiting and went by the stairs He thought Miss Whitehall went that way Yes it was the only way she could have gone He supposed she d got impatient or hysterical and just rushed pell mell down Did Troop or anyone else see her in the lower hall or leaving the building No I questioned him careful about that He thought she d seen the excitement on Broadway and run down and maybe met someone who d told her what had happened And not wanting to get in it she d gone out the side door Anyway he said she wasn t in the ground floor hall or out in the street with the others or he d have seen her There was a pause In that pause like figures in a picture I saw George amazed petrified staring at his father Molly looking from one to the other and the chief with his brows low down and his head drooped gazing at the fire In a moment they would burst into speech the speech that was withheld while that astounding revelation found acceptance in their minds To hear what they said to listen to what I couldn t believe and yet couldn t contradict was more than I could stand just then Without a word unnoticed by any of them I slipped out fled down the hall into the elevator and out to the street It was cold a sharp frosty night with a few stars shining in the deep blue sky Dark masses of men flowed out of the doors of skyscrapers and drained away down the subway entrances I jostled through them elbowing them right and left instinctively turning my face uptown deaf to the curses that followed me blind to the lights that stretched in a spangled vista in front What did it mean What could it mean I d understood the lie about Barker but now those other lies She had said she went down about six in the elevator I d heard her there was no getting away from it Was that the reason the old man had wanted to see her Suddenly I saw again his look of hungry expectation when Molly was announced and with a stifled sound I stopped short As lightning plays upon a dark landscape for a moment showing it plain I had a clear glimpse of the line of thought he d been pursuing The horror of it held me rooted there rigid as a dead man in the midst of the hurrying crowd Incredible hideous unbelievable Association with criminals had warped and diseased his judgment And then like a sinister shadow creeping on me dark and ominous rose the memory of her guarded face the flame of color she couldn t hide the dropped purse I started out again fighting the shadow but all I had to fight with was my belief in her She couldn t it was impossible I d die swearing it And battering against that belief came questions insistent maddening Why couldn t she speak out Why didn t she admit the truth say that Barker was her lover and have done with it Why had she lied about him about the time she left about everything she could have frankly admitted if if When I got there I could go no farther Cursing under my breath I forged along the air ice cold on the sweat that was damp on my forehead
