Eric like the violets and primroses came earlier that third spring He seemed an old friend now with an established footing in the house Yet I had never been alone with him for more than five minutes before the day I told him my secret I had imagined it all so different from the way it fell out I said to myself that I would meet him on his way home some evening after he had played the last round He would never know that I had been waiting for him in the copse but that would be where I should tell him standing by the nearer stile where I had first seen kindness in his eyes My mother s health was worse again that spring and when I wasn t studying I was much with her After Eric came I stayed with her even more for he said she had lost ground He discouraged her from coming downstairs I believe he prevailed on her to keep her room chiefly by coming constantly to see her bringing[Pg ] books and papers My mother s sick room was not like any other I have seen It was full of light and air and hope and pleasantness She would lie on the sofa in one of the loose gowns she looked so lovely in and we would have tea up there Nearly always I managed to go down to the door with Eric One day that very first week he came a good hour before we expected him Bettina had shut herself up to write to Hermione and I am afraid my mother is asleep I said Well you are not he answered I saw his eyes fall on the books and papers that littered the morning room sofa and I felt myself grow red The books would betray me The strange thing was that he pushed them away without ever looking at them And he sat down beside me He had never been so close to me before I think I was outwardly quite unmoved But I could not see him even at a distance without inward commotion When he sat down so near me a great many pulses I had not known before were in my body began to beat and hammer I[Pg ] felt my heart grow many sizes too big and my breast bone ache under the pressure I said to myself the one essential was that he should not suspect for him to guess the state he had thrown me into would be the supreme disaster He might despise me Almost certainly he would think I was hysterical I knew the contempt he felt for hysterical women Never never should he think me one I would rather die sitting rigidly in my corner without a sign than let him think I had any taint of the hysterical in me Above all for my Great Secret s sake I must show self command Upon that I saw in a flash this was the ideal moment for telling him about The Plan He asked how had my mother slept I don t know what I said But I remember that he spoke very gently of her And he said I must husband my strength I stayed too much indoors he said Hereafter I was to take an hour s brisk walk every day of my life I told him I couldn t always do that in these days You must he said I thought of my books and shook my head [Pg ] Won t you do it if I ask you to he said He leaned a little towards me I dared not look up I understand your not wanting to leave your mother he said But couldn t your sister Then before I could answer No he said smiling a little I suppose she couldn t There was something in his tone that did not please me You mean Betty is too young No he didn t mean that he said What did he mean Well she has other preoccupations hasn t she he said lightly You mean Hermione Hermione and all the family are in London No he didn t mean Hermione I was in too much inner turmoil to disentangle his meaning then For he went on quickly to say Suppose I sit with your mother for that hour while you go out and get some exercise I was to lose an hour of him tramping about alone The very thought gave me an immense self pity My eyes grew moist Come come I said to myself keep a tight rein Just as I was getting myself under control[Pg ] again he undid it all by laying his hand over mine Let me help you he said Oh w will you I stammered while to myself I said He is being kind don t think it is more don t dare think it is more Though I couldn t help thinking it was more I turned to the thought of my Great Scheme as a kind of refuge from a feeling too overwhelming to be faced And yet I don t know it may have been partly some survival in me of the coquetry I thought I hated that too may have helped to make me catch nervously at a change of subject So I interrupted with something about If you really do want to help me But I found I could not talk coherently while his touch was on my hand The words I had rehearsed and meant to say they flew away I felt my thoughts dissolving my brain a jelly my bones turning to water With the little remnant of will power left I drew my hand away My soul and my body seemed to bleed at the wound of that sundering For in those few seconds contact we two seemed[Pg ] to have grown into one I found I had risen to my feet and gone to sit by the table with a sense of having left most of myself behind clinging to his hand I made an immense effort to remember things he had told us about those early struggles of his And I asked questions about that time questions that made him stare How did you guess What put that in your head I said I imagined it would be like that Well it was like that And you overcame everything I triumphed You are the fortunate one of your family He laughed a little grim kind of laugh The standard of fortune is not very high with us He looked thoroughly discontented I am afraid I said you are one of the ungrateful people What had he to be grateful for He threw the question at me Why that you have the most interesting profession in the world I said You don t mean the practice of medicine mere bread and butter You don t love your profession He smiled and that time the smile was less[Pg ] ungenial But I had not liked the tone of patronage about his work They were all wasted on you then those splendid opportunities the clinic in Hamburg the years in Paris Oh well he looked taken aback at my arraignment I mayn t be a thundering success but I won t say I m a waster If you don t love and adore the finest profession in the world Yes somebody else ought to have had your chances Me for instance You Oh I dare say his smile was humorous and humouring You think I m not in earnest But I am I went to the cupboard where Bettina and I each had a shelf and brought out an old wooden workbox I opened it with the little key on my chain I took out papers and letters These are from the Women s Medical School in Hunter Street I laid the letters open before him answers to my inquiries about terms and conditions He glanced through one or two What put this into your head he said astonished and not the least pleased so far as one could see How did you know of the existence of these people [Pg ] You left a copy of the Lancet here once Something in his face made me add But I should have found a way without that What way way to what He spoke irritably in a raised voice I looked anxiously at the door We won t say anything just yet to my mother I begged My mother wouldn t understand What wouldn t she understand All his kindness had gone He was once more the cold inaccessible creature I had seen that first day stalking up to Big Klaus s door What I mean is I explained quite miserably crestfallen my mother wouldn t understand what I feel about studying medicine But you and I had a struggle to keep the tears back I ve looked forward so to telling you He turned the papers over with an odd misliking expression For one thing you could never pass the entrance examination he said I asked why he thought that Do you see yourself going to classes in London cramming yourself with all this his hand swept the qualifications list [Pg ] Not classes in London I said But people do the London Matriculation without that I am taking the University Tutorial Correspondence Course I said I was swallowing tears as I boasted myself already rather good at Botany and French My mother thought even my German tolerable I picked up the little pamphlet issued by the University of London on the subject of Matriculation Regulations and I pointed out Section III Provincial Examinations The January and June Matriculation Examinations were held at the Brighton Municipal Technical College He could see that made it all quite convenient and easy I can see it is all quite mad he answered Suppose by some miracle you were to pass the entrance exams have you any idea how long they keep you grinding away afterwards Five to seven years I said Well Can t you see what a wild idea it is I said to myself he knows about our straitened means You mean it costs such a great deal It costs a great deal more than you think he said shifting about discontentedly in his chair [Pg ] Then I told him that my mother had some jewels I am sure that when she sees I am in earnest when I have got my B A she will be willing I should use the jewels It s a dog s life he said for a woman I gathered my precious papers together You think I shall mind the hard work But I shan t It isn t the hard work he said though it s not easy for a man For a woman he left the woman medical student hanging over the abyss For all my questions I could not bring him to the point of saying what these bugbears were He was plainly tired of the subject My first disappointment had yielded to a spiritless catechism of how this and how that My persistent canvass of the matter brought him nearer a manifestation of ill temper than I had ever seen in him There was a great deal he said that he couldn t talk about to a girl of eighteen But had I or anybody else ever heard of a man who was a doctor himself wanting his sister or his daughter to study medicine He had never known one Not one I confessed I couldn t think why that was except[Pg ] that nobody belonging to a girl ever wanted her to do anything except I stopped short and then hurried on But after all you know that women do go through the medical schools and come out all right He shook his head They ve lost something Though I admit most of the women you mean never had the thing I mean I said I didn t understand Well you ought to You ve got it He looked at me with an odd expression and asked how long I d had this notion in my head I said a year All this time You ve been full of this ever since I was here last I lied I said I had thought of absolutely nothing else all that time He stood up but I still sat there wondering what had made me tell him that lie You won t go I said without seeing my mother To day he hadn t time I went down with him as usual to the front door weeping inwardly yet hoping praying that before the door closed he would say something that would help something kind [Pg ] He often said the best things of all just as he was going as though he had not dared to be half so interesting or a tenth so kind but in the very act of making his escape To day he put on his covert coat in a moody silence Still silent he took his hat I stood with the door knob in my hand You think then even if Aunt Josephine helped Who is Aunt Josephine My father s step sister She is well off Aunt Josephine s riches made no impression upon him He was going away a different man from the one who had come in and pushed away my papers to sit beside me and to take my hand He pulled his stick out of the umbrella stand You feel sure I couldn t I pleaded at the door I feel sure you could do something better He was out on the step Good bye he said with the look that hurt me so tired disappointed He had come for peace for my mother s tranquil spirit to bring rest to his tired mind And all he had found here was my mother s daughter fretting to be out in the fray I had[Pg ] not even listened I had interrupted and pulled away my hand After I shut the door I opened it again and called out Oh what was it you were going to tell me It wouldn t interest you he said without even turning round primroses n primrose Wild flowers such as orchids and primroses are becoming rare The
