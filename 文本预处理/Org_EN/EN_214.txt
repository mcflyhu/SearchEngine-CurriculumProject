Madame Aurore was little and wasted and shrill She had deep scars in her neck and dead looking yellow hair She was drenched in cheap scent Her untidy helter skelter dress gave no hint of the admirable taste she lavished upon others She saw at once what we ought to have and she talked about our clothes with an enthusiasm as great as Betty s own Ah but Madame she remonstrated dramatically when my mother showed her the new white satin which was for me and a creamy lace gown which was to be modernised for Bettina not b t vhite My mother explained that my gown was to have rose coloured garnishing Mais non mais non Madame must pardon her for the liberty but she Madame Aurore could not bring herself to see our chief advantage thrown away [Pg ] What then was our chief advantage Betty demanded What indeed but the contrast between us The moment she laid eyes on the hair of Mademoiselle Bettina she had said to herself the frock of Mademoiselle Bettina should be that tender green of tilleul with just a note of bleu de ciel Oh a dress of spring time an April dress a gay little dress for all its tenderness A dress to make happy the heart of all who look thereon But green We had sent all the way to London for the white satin and we had no green Then twas in truth une bonne chance that Madame Aurore had She often bought up bargains and gave her clients an opportunity to acquire them She rushed out of the room and returned with a piece of silk chiffon of the most adorable hue She showed us the effect over white satin My satin But then as Madame Aurore said we could so easily send to Stagg and Mantle s for more She looked at me out of snapping black eyes eyes like animated boot buttons Yes yes for you Mademoiselle ze note sall be s r nit hein Zis priceless old lace over ivory satin [Pg ] Ah She struck an attitude I see it So and so A ceinture panne couleur de feuille d automne touched with gold broderie Hein Oh very distingu hein It must not be expensive we had to say that to Madame Aurore all that first day at regular intervals But she had her way She sewed hard and she chattered as hard as she sewed Bettina ran across her in the passage that first evening as Madame Aurore came up from supper And they began instantly on the fruitful theme of green gown My mother called out to Bettina that she had talked enough about clothes for one day and in any case she had left us to go early to bed Bettina regretted her rash promise wasn t the least tired and could have talked clothes till cock crow There was some argument on this head at the door in which Madame Aurore joined with too great a freedom and an elaborate air of ranging herself on my mother s side This pleased least of all the person Madame Aurore designed to propitiate Madame Aurore I am sure had not been in the house an hour before she had taken the measure[Pg ] of our main preoccupation Mademoiselle Bettina ought to be grateful she said to have a mother so devoted so solicitous Standing near the open door she piled up an exaggerated case of maternal love There was nothing in life like the love between mother and child Ah didn t she know Her own little girl My mother said she must have the door shut now and I was sent to undo Betty s gown Bettina thought it angelic of Madame Aurore not to resent our mother s lack of interest in the small Aurore According to Bettina Madame showed a wonderfully nice disposition in not withdrawing her interest from us after that She seemed rather to imply very well you don t care about my child but I am still ready to care about yours Parfaitement the little dressmaker remembered Bettina s passing Dew Pond House the summer before It was true what Hermione had reported Madame Aurore had leaned out of the window to watch Bettina She had even expressed the wish that she might have the dressing of cette jolie enfant Oh but life was a droll affair [Pg ] Bettina thought it entirely delightful She went about the house singing The first time Madame Aurore heard Bettina she arrested the rapid stab of her basting needle Who ees dat That is my youngest daughter She tink to go on ze stage Oh no Not It ees a vast zat She was always cold Whenever we were out of the morning room she piled on the coal On the second day I remonstrated Fuel I explained was very expensive so far from the coal fields She smiled You are ze careful one hein and she looked at me in a way which made me uncomfortable But I did not feel about the poor little creature as my mother did My mother went so far as to wish we had not sent for her She would never have allowed her to come if she had seen her first I thought my mother severe Everybody else including the servants liked Madame Aurore No wonder She spent her life doing things for people Sewing for us all[Pg ] day like mad so that our two best frocks might be finished in spite of the shortness of the time and still ready at nightfall to show the cook how to make p tite marmite or sauce la financi re equally ready to advise the housemaid how to give the Bond Street not to say the Rue de la Paix touch to her Sunday alpaca and chic to old Ransom s beehive hat If she asked them one and all more questions in a minute than they could answer in a month what did that show but the generous interest she took in her fellow beings Bettina with her little air of large experience said that Madame Aurore was the most sympathetic person she had ever met Madame Aurore s benevolent concern about our clothes our soups sauces and servants and everything that was ours extended to our friends and relations and everything that was theirs She had never she said known people let alone such charming people as we with so few acquaintances Bettina thought Madame Aurore was sorry for us She asked a great deal about the Helmstones Ze only friends and zey are avay for seex mont Ah it was well we were going to London We[Pg ] should die else of aloneness Aunt Josephine plainly was the one ray of light in our grey existence Where did she live Lowndes Square Ah but a very expensive and splendid part of London No news to us who had our own private measure for social altitudes Bettina had looked out Lowndes Square on our faded map of London Aunt Josephine was only a private person but she lived nearer the King and Queen than the Helmstones did And for all her being a Biosophist she had asked us to stay for the Coronation Bettina frequently led the conversation to the great event of June But this queer little Frenchwoman was more interested in Aunt Josephine than she was in the King and Queen Here was distinction for an Aunt And what was she like this lady We must have a picture of our only and so valuable relation Bettina went and rooted about in the deep print and photograph drawer till she brought Aunt Josephine to light Very faded and old fashioned looking but Madame Aurore regarded the face with a respectful enthusiasm Oh une[Pg ] grande dame une vraie grande dame Madame Aurore understood better now what was required We repudiated on our aunt s behalf the idea that she was so much grande dame as philanthropist thinker recluse We did not deny her grandeur We but clarified it or at least Bettina did Bettina talks too much to that woman my mother said to me privately She sent for Bettina and told her she was not to speak to Madame Aurore about anything except her work Bettina thought to interpret this order literally would be inhuman Besides she considered it very nice of Madame Aurore to take such an interest in us I am grateful when people take an interest said Bettina with her air of superiority When my mother heard that Bettina had been discussing Aunt Josephine and had unearthed the photograph to show to Madame Aurore she was annoyed Go and bring me the picture she said Bettina went into the morning room and looked about for some minutes The little dressmaker sat there in a litter of white and green sewing[Pg ] furiously Bettina said at last that she hated most dreadfully to bother Madame Aurore but where was that old photograph Madame Aurore looked up absently Had Mademoiselle Bettina not taken it out Perhaps I did Bettina scoured the house Aunt Josephine s photograph was never found I was glad our mother did not know that Bettina had told Madame Aurore about the pendant and the diamond star Bettina excused herself by saying Madame Aurore had been so certain a lady like our mother must have jewels and that she would lend them to her daughters in order to put the finishing touch of elegance to our toilette Betty had felt it due to our mother to acknowledge that a part at least of this exalted expectation was not so wide of the mark And Bettina endorsed Madame Aurore s opinion that a diamond star certainly would light up my ivory satin and old lace Also but no we must do without The green frock was all but finished We had[Pg ] brought the cheval glass out of my mother s room She was not strong enough to stand the patchouli so she missed the great moment of the final trying on Bettina stood before the glass looking somehow more childish than ever or rather seeming less of common earth and more of fairyland in the tunic frock of green her short curls on her neck My fancy that she was like somebody out of The Midsummer Night s Dream was set to flight by Madame Aurore s shower of couturi re s compliment mixed with highly practical considerations such as See how it falls when you sit down Parfaitement And can you valk in it But wis grace Bettina proved she could A merveille Sapristi Mademoiselle Bettine would see the sensation she was going to create in London Could she lift ze arm hein Mais belle comme un ange many makers of quite beautiful gowns studied the effect seulement en repos Mademoiselle Bettine would without doubt dance in that frock Let us see did it lend itself Bettina moved about the morning room to waltz time laughing at and with Madame Aurore stopping to make court curtsies [Pg ] watching in the glass if green frock had pretty manners One thing more its maker said and behold Perfection It needed it cried aloud for a single jewel Ah yes Bettina s look fell No doubt the finishing touch would have been a pearl and emerald pendant But Madame Aurore struck in with a torrential rapture drowning explanation and regret Life Madame Aurore shrilled was for ever using her humble instrument though she was for the working out of these benevolences There had she but three days ago all innocent unknowing tossed that piece of chiffon tilleul into her trunk Or rather not her hand performed the act not hers at all The hand of Fate And now The Finger pointing straight at the pearl and emerald pendant But instantly must Mademoiselle Bettine go and get the ravishing jewel the diamond star as well while she was about it Then poor Betty had to say these glories were no more Madame Aurore snapped her boot button eyes and rolled them up Our poor poor mother [Pg ] Deeply ah but profoundly Madame Aurore commiserated une dame si distingu e si l gante being in straitened circumstances Ah Madame Aurore understood She would be most economical with the coals All the same she wasn t But what did it matter since she turned us out dresses that we were sure Hermione herself would have characterised as Dreams Bettina went about the house singing Where are you going to my pretty maid Going to London Sir she said Madame Aurore even managed to put the finishing touches to the two frocks made in the village which Bettina called our Coronation robes just white muslin but not just muslin at all after they had passed through Madame Aurore s hands She listened indulgently while Bettina wondered how the young Princes would like driving through London in a gold coach and above all how the little Princess would feel and how she would look and how did Madame Aurore think she would do her hair [Pg ] I don t like that woman my mother observed pointedly to Bettina Oh dearest she feels it I know from something I do not object to her knowing But I am not interested in Madame Aurore My mother dismissed her The fact was that none of the torrent of talk carried on now in a whisper with elaborate deference to the ch re malade none of it had to do with Madame Aurore herself We had had to ask her all of the little we came to know about her She had no regular business in London Ah no she was too often ill She merely went out to work when she was strong enuss Zen too ze leedle gal I haf to sink about her The thought seemed one to harass All would be different if Mme Aurore had a shop We agreed that to have a shop full of lovely French models would be delightful And by and by the little Aurore would help in the shop Nevair said Mme Aurore with sudden passion She knew all about being in shops It was to prevent her daughter from knowing too [Pg ] that Mme Aurore must make money The little Aurore should go to the Convent school which seemed somehow an odd destination for the daughter of Madame Aurore She spoke of it as a far dream beckoning Nossing but nossing can be done in zis world vidout monny And what people will do for money oh little did we know But the world was like that Eh bien Madame Aurore had not made it Had she done so it would be a better place Betty and I smiled at the pains taken to make this clear Madame Aurore professed herself revolted by an arrangement which made ze goodness or ze badness of a pairson dependent upon where you happened to find yourself Par example you can be extr mement good here More She would go so far as to say you must be a genius to discover how to be bad here Through Betty s laughing protest the little woman went on with seriousness to assure us it was une chose bien diff rente dans she checked herself bit off the end of her thread and spat it out It is different you mean in Crutchley[Pg ] Street Betty asked And though she got no answer I think we both understood the anxious mother to be thinking of the small Aurore left all alone in one of the world s Mean Streets Perhaps the reason Betty got no answer to her question was that she had slightly raised her voice in putting it and I had said Sh What ees it Madame Aurore demanded looking round I was only reminding Betty I said We mustn t disturb my mother Hah naturally not Whatever happened she was not to be disturbed I was afraid from the tone in which Madame Aurore said this that she thought I had been reproving her And to divert her thoughts I asked Who takes care of her the little daughter while you are away Again she bit viciously at the thread Not motch care The small eyes snapped as she drew the thread through the needle s eye I had never seen even her hands fly so fast or her whole feverish little body attack the basting with such fury of energy as after that reference to the child left behind in Crutchley Street [Pg ] Bettina said soothingly I suppose you left her with some good friend Ze best I haf The admission was made in an accent so coldly hopeless that Bettina round eyed said Oh dear isn t she a nice friend She is like ozzers She is as nice as she can afford Madame Aurore had recovered her shrill vivacity She had not after all taken to heart my hint about keeping our voices down In some parts of ze vorld she went on in that raised defiant note you might be quite good for a week wis luck for a few months but you could not be good from year s end to year s end Why was that Bettina asked softly Madame Aurore laughed out Ze climat she said in a voice that must certainly have penetrated the next room Somesing in ze air Then lower with a tigerish swiftness I shall not ron ze risk for my liddle gal Non She tossed the satin on the machine thrust it under the needle and seemed to work the treadle by dint of compressing lips and knitting brows Bettina and I agreed we would not talk to her any more about her daughter since unlike most[Pg ] mothers the thought of her child did not soften Madame Aurore but made her hard and angry We put this down to wounded feelings at my mother s curt dismissal of the theme Surreptitiously for she knew leave would be refused Bettina gave Madame Aurore some of our old toys and other little gifts to take home to her daughter I did not prevent this for I too felt uneasily that we ought somehow to make up for our mother s nervous detestation of Madame Aurore Had this as the little dressmaker hinted something of sheer sickness in it an invalid s caprice Bettina said lightheartedly Oh it s only because Aurore is a foreigner Mother admits she never did like foreigners After the first day there was almost no personal interchange between Madame Aurore and her employer Yet I had a queer feeling that a silent drama was being played out between those two who without meeting were acting and reacting upon each other Madame Aurore asked each day How was madame in a voice of extremest solicitude nay of gloomiest apprehension [Pg ] I found myself wrestling with an uncomfortable feeling that this hopeless view of my mother s health was somehow prompted by a desire to get even with the one unresponsive member of our little circle to get even in the only way open to Madame Aurore I knew she advised the housemaid to look out for another place and offered to find her one in London where she would be paid double and have almost nothing to do The housemaid was greatly tempted but I was told she said she wouldn t go till her mistress was better Bettair She vill not last a mont said Madame Aurore At first such echoes as reached me of these prognostications made me merely angry But I could not quite cast them aside I began to wonder miserably if there were anything in this view After all we too even Eric had held it ourselves only such a little while before I wrote to Aunt Josephine to say that if my mother were not better by Monday morning I should bring Bettina as arranged but I would stay only one night and go home the next day The question rose on Friday as to whether[Pg ] Madame Aurore should return to London on Saturday night or some time on Sunday Saturday night said my mother with decision Bettina ventured to urge the Sunday alternative The poor little thing is so tired after sewing all day To which my mother responded by ordering the cart for Saturday evening I cannot sleep with that woman in the house Bettina ran in to say Madame Aurore was ready to say good bye To our embarrassment our mother would not permit Madame Aurore to enter the room even for the purpose of taking leave We went out and did what we could to soften the refusal She has not been sleeping She is trying to rest She is so much obliged to you Ah Madame Aurore understood Our poor poor mother was undoubtedly failing We were adjured to take every care Certainly we should not both leave the poor lady We told Madame Aurore that we should[Pg ] never forget her I shall take good care of the address Bettina said No Madame Aurore would send us a new address She was looking for larger rooms She believed she was going to be stronger now She meant to take on two or three hands In that case she would not be able to go out any more to people s houses She would let us know She filled the hall with her patchouli and shrill vivacity and presently was gone When we went back into my mother s room we found her telling the housemaid to hang our gowns in a draught to purify them Betty was moved to some final remonstrance My mother cut her short That was a horrible woman Well well I said she s gone Yes That is the best that can be
