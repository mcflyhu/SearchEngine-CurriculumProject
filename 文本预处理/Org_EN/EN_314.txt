On the seventeenth the day I was trysted with the Writer I had much rebellion against fate The thought of him waiting in the King s Arms and of what he would think and what he would say when next we met tormented and oppressed me The truth was unbelievable so much I had to grant and it seemed cruel hard I should be posted as a liar and a coward and have never consciously omitted what it was possible that I should do I repeated this form of words with a kind of bitter relish and re examined in that light the steps of my behaviour It seemed I had behaved to James Stewart as a brother might all the past was a picture that I could be proud of and there was only the present to consider I could not swim the sea nor yet fly in the air but there was always Andie I had done him a service he liked me I had a lever there to work on if it were just for decency I must try once more with Andie It was late afternoon there was no sound in all the Bass but the lap and bubble of a very quiet sea and my four companions were all crept apart the three [pg ]Macgregors higher on the rock and Andie with his Bible to a sunny place among the ruins there I found him in deep sleep and as soon as he was awake appealed to him with some fervour of manner and a good show of argument If I thoucht it was to do guid to ye Shaws said he staring at me over his spectacles It s to save another said I and to redeem my word What would be more good than that Do ye no mind the scripture Andie And you with the Book upon your lap What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world Ay said he that s grand for you But where do I come in I have my word to redeem the same s yoursel And what are ye asking me to do but just to sell it ye for siller Andie have I named the name of siller cried I Ou the name s naething said he the thing is there whatever It just comes to this if I am to service ye the way that you propose I ll loss my lieihood Then it s clear ye ll have to make it up to me and a pickle mair for your ain credit like And what s that but just a bribe And if even I was certain of the bribe But by a that I can learn it s far frae that and if you were to hang where would I be Na the thing s no possible And just awa wi ye like a bonny lad and let Andie read his chapter I remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with [pg ]this result and the next humour I fell into was one I had near said of gratitude to Prestongrange who had saved me in this violent illegal manner out of the midst of my dangers temptations and perplexities But this was both too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long and the remembrance of James began to succeed to the possession of my spirits The st the day set for the trial I passed in such misery of mind as I can scarce recall to have endured save perhaps upon Isle Earraid only Much of the time I lay on a braeside betwixt sleep and waking my body motionless my mind full of violent thoughts Sometimes I slept indeed but the court house of Inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides to find his missing witness followed me in slumber and I would wake again with a start to darkness of spirit and distress of body I thought Andie seemed to observe me but I paid him little heed Verily my bread was bitter to me and my days a burthen Early the next morning Friday nd a boat came with provisions and Andie placed a packet in my hand The cover was without address but sealed with a Government seal It enclosed two notes Mr Balfour can now see for himself it is too late to meddle His conduct will be observed and his discretion rewarded So ran the first which seemed to be laboriously writ with the left hand There was certainly nothing in these expressions to compromise the writer even if that [pg ]person could be found the seal which formidably served instead of signature was affixed to a separate sheet on which there was no scratch of writing and I had to confess that so far my adversaries knew what they were doing and to digest as well as I was able the threat that peeped under the promise But the second enclosure was by far the more surprising It was in a lady s hand of writ Maister Dauvit Balfour is informed a friend was speiring for him and her eyes were of the grey it ran and seemed so extraordinary a piece to come to my hands at such a moment and under cover of a Government seal that I stood stupid Catriona s grey eyes shone in my remembrance I thought with a bound of pleasure she must be the friend But who should the writer be to have her billet thus enclosed with Prestongrange s And of all wonders why was it thought needful to give me this pleasing but most inconsequential intelligence upon the Bass For the writer I could hit upon none possible except Miss Grant Her family I remembered had remarked on Catriona s eyes and even named her for their colour and she herself had been much in the habit to address me with a broad pronunciation by way of a sniff I supposed at my rusticity No doubt besides but she lived in the same house as this letter came from So there remained but one step to be accounted for and that was how Prestongrange should have permitted her at all in an affair so secret or let [pg ]her daft like billet go in the same cover with his own But even here I had a glimmering For first of all there was something rather alarming about the young lady and papa might be more under her domination than I knew And second there was the man s continual policy to be remembered how his conduct had been continually mingled with caresses and he had scarce ever in the midst of so much contention laid aside a mask of friendship He must conceive that my imprisonment had incensed me Perhaps this little jesting friendly message was intended to disarm my rancour I will be honest and I think it did I felt a sudden warmth towards that beautiful Miss Grant that she should stoop to so much interest in my affairs The summoning up of Catriona moved me of itself to milder and more cowardly counsels If the Advocate knew of her and of our acquaintance if I should please him by some of that discretion at which his letter pointed to what might not this lead In vain is the net spread in the sight of any fowl the scripture says Well fowls must be wiser than folk For I thought I perceived the policy and yet fell in with it I was in this frame my heart beating the grey eyes plain before me like two stars when Andie broke in upon my musing I see ye hae gotten guid news said he I found him looking curiously in my face with that there came before me like a vision of James Stewart and [pg ]the court of Inverary and my mind turned at once like a door upon its hinges Trials I reflected sometimes draw out longer than is looked for Even if I came to Inverary just too late something might yet be attempted in the interests of James and in those of my own character the best would be accomplished In a moment it seemed without thought I had a plan devised Andie said I is it still to be to morrow He told me nothing was changed Was anything said about the hour I asked He told me it was to be two o clock afternoon And about the place I pursued Whatten place says Andie The place I m to be landed at said I He owned there was nothing as to that Very well then I said this shall be mine to arrange The wind is in the east my road lies westward keep your boat I hire it let us work up the Forth all day and land me at two o clock to morrow at the westmost we ll can have reached Ye daft callant he cried ye would try for Inverary after a Just that Andie says I Weel ye re ill to beat says he And I was kind o sorry for ye a day yesterday he added Ye see I was never entirely sure till then which way of it ye really wantit [pg ]Here was a spur to a lame horse A word in your ear Andie said I This plan of mine has another advantage yet We can leave these Hielandmen behind us on the rock and one of your boats from the Castleton can bring them off to morrow Yon Neil has a queer eye when he regards you maybe if I was once out of the gate there might be knives again these red shanks are unco grudgeful And if there should come to be any question here is your excuse Our lives were in danger by these savages being answerable for my safety you chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the rest of the time on board your boat and do you know Andie says I with a smile I think it was very wisely chosen The truth is I have nae goo for Neil says Andie nor he for me I m thinking and I would like ill to come to my hands wi the man Tam Anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway For this man Anster came from Fife where the Gaelic is still spoken Ay ay says Andie Tam ll can deal with them the best And troth the mair I think of it the less I see what way we would be required The place ay feggs they had forgot the place Eh Shaws ye re a lang heided chield when ye like Forby that I m awing ye my life he added with more solemnity and offered me his hand upon the bargain [pg ]Whereupon with scarce more words we stepped suddenly on board the boat cast off and set the lug The Gregara were then busy upon breakfast for the cookery was their usual part but one of them stepping to the battlements our flight was observed before we were twenty fathoms from the rock and the three of them ran about the ruins and the landing shelf for all the world like ants about a broken nest hailing and crying on us to return We were still in both the lee and the shadow of the rock which last lay broad upon the waters but presently came forth in almost the same moment into the wind and sunshine the sail filled the boat heeled to the gunwale and we swept immediately beyond sound of the men s voices To what terrors they endured upon the rock where they were now deserted without the countenance of any civilised person or so much as the protection of a Bible no limit can be set nor had they any brandy left to be their consolation for even in the haste and secrecy of our departure Andie had managed to remove it It was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the Glenteithy Rocks so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen to the next day Thence we kept away up Firth The breeze which was then so spirited swiftly declined but never wholly failed us All day we kept moving though often not much more and it was after dark ere we were up with the Queensferry To keep the letter of Andie s engagement or [pg ]what was left of it I must remain on board but I thought no harm to communicate with the shore in writing On Prestongrange s cover where the Government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent I writ by the boat s lantern a few necessary words and Andie carried them to Rankeillor In about an hour he came aboard again with a purse of money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing saddled for me by two to morrow at Clackmannan Pool This done and the boat riding by her stone anchor we lay down to sleep under the sail We were in the Pool the next day long ere two and there was nothing left for me but sit and wait I felt little alacrity upon my errand I would have been glad of any passable excuse to lay it down but none being to be found my uneasiness was no less great than if I had been running to some desired pleasure By shortly after one the horse was at the waterside and I could see a man walking it to and fro till I should land which vastly swelled my impatience Andie ran the moment of my liberation very fine showing himself a man of his bare word but scarce serving his employers with a heaped measure and by about fifty seconds after two I was in the saddle and on the full stretch for Stirling In a little more than an hour I had passed that town and was already mounting Alan Water side when the weather broke in a small tempest The rain blinded me the wind had nearly beat me from the saddle and [pg ]the first darkness of the night surprised me in a wilderness still some way east of Balwhidder not very sure of my direction and mounted on a horse that began already to be weary In the press of my hurry and to be spared the delay and annoyance of a guide I had followed so far as it was possible for any horseman the line of my journey with Alan This I did with open eyes foreseeing a great risk in it which the tempest had now brought to a reality The last that I knew of where I was I think it must have been about Uam Var the hour perhaps six at night I must still think it great good fortune that I got about eleven to my destination the house of Duncan Dhu Where I had wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell I know we were twice down and once over the saddle and for a moment carried away in a roaring burn Steed and rider were bemired up to the eyes From Duncan I had news of the trial It was followed in all these Highland regions with religious interest news of it spread from Inverary as swift as men could travel and I was rejoiced to learn that up to a late hour that Saturday it was not yet concluded and all men began to suppose it must spread over to the Monday Under the spur of this intelligence I would not sit to eat but Duncan having agreed to be my guide took the road again on foot with the piece in my hand and munching as I went Duncan brought with [pg ]him a flask of usquebaugh and a hand lantern which last enlightened us just so long as we could find houses where to rekindle it for the thing leaked outrageously and blew out with every gust The more part of the night we walked blindfold among sheets of rain and day found us aimless on the mountains Hard by we struck a hut on a burn side where we got a bite and a direction and a little before the end of the sermon came to the kirk doors of Inverary The rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me but I was still bogged as high as to the knees I streamed water I was so weary I could hardly limp and my face was like a ghost s I stood certainly more in need of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on than of all the benefits in Christianity For all which being persuaded the chief point for me was to make myself immediately public I set the door open entered that church with the dirty Duncan at my tails and finding a vacant place hard by sat down Thirteenthly my brethren and in parenthesis the law itself must be regarded as a means of grace the minister was saying in the voice of one delighting to pursue an argument The sermon was in English on account of the assize The judges were present with their armed attendants the halberts glittered in a corner by the door and the seats were thronged beyond custom with the array of lawyers The text was in Romans th and th the [pg ]minister a skilled hand and the whole of that able churchful from Argyle and my Lords Elchies and Kilkerran down to the halbertmen that came in their attendance was sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical attention The minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the door observed our entrance at the moment and immediately forgot the same the rest either did not hear or would not heed and I sat there amongst my friends and enemies unremarked The first that I singled out was Prestongrange He sat well forward like an eager horseman in the saddle his lips moving with relish his eyes glued on the minister the doctrine was clearly to his mind Charles Stewart on the other hand was half asleep and looked harassed and pale As for Symon Fraser he appeared like a blot and almost a scandal in the midst of that attentive congregation digging his hands in his pockets shifting his legs clearing his throat rolling up his bald eyebrows and shooting out his eyes to right and left now with a yawn now with a secret smile At times too he would take the Bible in front of him run it through seem to read a bit run it through again and stop and yawn prodigiously the whole as if for exercise In the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself He sat a second stupefied than tore a half leaf out of the Bible scrawled upon it with a pencil and passed it with a whispered word to his next neighbor [pg ]The note came to Prestongrange who gave me but the one look thence it voyaged to the hands of Mr Erskine thence again to Argyle where he sat between the other two lords of session and his Grace turned and fixed me with an arrogant eye The last of those interested to observe my presence was Charlie Stewart and he too began to pencil and hand about despatches none of which I was able to trace to their destination in the crowd But the passage of these notes had aroused notice all who were in the secret or supposed themselves to be so were whispering information the rest questions and the minister himself seemed quite discountenanced by the flutter in the church and sudden stir and whispering His voice changed he plainly faltered nor did he again recover the easy conviction and full tones of his delivery It would be a puzzle to him till his dying day why a sermon that had gone with triumph through four parts should thus miscarry in the fifth As for me I continued to sit there very wet and weary and a good deal anxious as to what should happen next but greatly exulting in my success writ n This is a copy of a writ I received this morning You shouldn t treat the newspapers as if they were Holy Writ
