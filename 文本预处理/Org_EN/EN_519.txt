When in half an hour Van Horn s sweat culminated in profusion it marked the breaking of the malarial attack Great physical relief was his and the last mists of delirium ebbed from his brain But he was left limply weak and after tossing off the blankets and recognizing Jerry he fell into a refreshing natural sleep Not till two hours later did he awake and start to go on deck Half way up the companion he deposited Jerry on deck and went back to the stateroom for a forgotten bottle of quinine But he did not immediately return to Jerry The long drawer under Borckman s bunk caught his eye The wooden button that held it shut was gone and it was far out and hanging at an angle that jammed it and prevented it from falling to the floor The matter was serious There was little doubt in his mind had the drawer in the midst of the squall of the previous night fallen to the floor that no Arangi and no soul of the eighty souls on board would have been left For the drawer was filled with a heterogeneous mess of dynamite sticks boxes of fulminating caps coils of fuses lead sinkers iron tools and many boxes of rifle revolver and pistol cartridges He sorted and arranged the varied contents and with a screwdriver and a longer screw reattached the button In the meantime Jerry was encountering new adventure not of the pleasantest While waiting for Skipper to return Jerry chanced to see the wild dog brazenly lying on deck a dozen feet from his lair in the trade boxes Instantly stiffly crouching Jerry began to stalk Success seemed assured for the wild dog with closed eyes was apparently asleep And at this moment the mate two legging it along the deck from for ard in the direction of the bottle stored between the yam sacks called Jerry in a remarkably husky voice Jerry flattened his filbert shaped ears and wagged his tail in acknowledgment but advertised his intention of continuing to stalk his enemy And at sound of the mate s voice the wild dog flung quick opened eyes in Jerry s direction and flashed into his burrow where he immediately turned around thrust his head out with a show of teeth and snarled triumphant defiance Baulked of his quarry by the inconsiderateness of the mate Jerry trotted back to the head of the companion to wait for Skipper But Borckman whose brain was well a crawl by virtue of the many nips clung to a petty idea after the fashion of drunken men Twice again imperatively he called Jerry to him and twice again with flattened ears of gentleness and wagging tail Jerry good naturedly expressed his disinclination Next he yearned his head over the coming and into the cabin after Skipper Borckman remembered his first idea and continued to the bottle which he generously inverted skyward But the second idea petty as it was persisted and after swaying and mumbling to himself for a time after unseeingly making believe to study the crisp fresh breeze that filled the Arangi s sails and slanted her deck and after sillily attempting on the helmsman to portray eagle like vigilance in his drink swimming eyes he lurched amidships toward Jerry Jerry s first intimation of Borckman s arrival was a cruel and painful clutch on his flank and groin that made him cry out in pain and whirl around Next as the mate had seen Skipper do in play Jerry had his jowls seized in a tooth clattering shake that was absolutely different from the Skipper s rough love shake His head and body were shaken his teeth clattered painfully and with the roughest of roughness he was flung part way down the slippery slope of deck Now Jerry was a gentleman All the soul of courtesy was in him for equals and superiors After all even in an inferior like the wild dog he did not consciously press an advantage very far never extremely far In his stalking and rushing of the wild dog he had been more sound and fury than an overbearing bully But with a superior with a two legged white god like Borckman there was more a demand upon his control restraint and inhibition of primitive promptings He did not want to play with the mate a game that he ecstatically played with Skipper because he had experienced no similar liking for the mate two legged white god that he was And still Jerry was all gentleness He came back in a feeble imitation rush of the whole hearted rush that he had learned to make on Skipper He was in truth acting play acting attempting to do what he had no heart prompting to do He made believe to play and uttered simulated growls that failed of the verity of simulation He bobbed his tail good naturedly and friendly and growled ferociously and friendly but the keenness of the drunkenness of the mate discerned the difference and aroused in him vaguely the intuition of difference of play acting of cheating Jerry was cheating out of his heart of consideration Borckman drunkenly recognized the cheating without crediting the heart of good behind it On the instant he was antagonistic Forgetting that he was only a brute he posited that this was no more than a brute with which he strove to play in the genial comradely way that the Skipper played Red war was inevitable not first on Jerry s part but on Borckman s part Borckman felt the abysmal urgings of the beast as a beast to prove himself master of this four legged beast Jerry felt his jowl and jaw clutched still more harshly and hardly and with increase of harshness and hardness he was flung farther down the deck which on account of its growing slant due to heavier gusts of wind had become a steep and slippery hill He came back clawing frantically up the slope that gave him little footing and he came back no longer with poorly attempted simulation of ferocity but impelled by the first flickerings of real ferocity He did not know this If he thought at all he was under the impression that he was playing the game as he had played it with Skipper In short he was taking an interest in the game although a radically different interest from what he had taken with Skipper This time his teeth flashed quicker and with deeper intent at the jowl clutching hand and missing he was seized and flung down the smooth incline harder and farther than before He was growing angry as he clawed back though he was not conscious of it But the mate being a man albeit a drunken one sensed the change in Jerry s attack ere Jerry dreamed there was any change in it And not only did Borckman sense it but it served as a spur to drive him back into primitive beastliness and to fight to master this puppy as a primitive man under dissimilar provocation might have fought with the members of the first litter stolen from a wolf den among the rocks True Jerry could trace as far back His ancient ancestors had been Irish wolf hounds and long before that the ancestors of the wolf hounds had been wolves The note in Jerry s growls changed The unforgotten and ineffaceable past strummed the fibres of his throat His teeth flashed with fierce intent in the desire of sinking as deep in the man s hand as passion could drive For Jerry by this time was all passion He had leaped back into the dark stark rawness of the early world almost as swiftly as had Borckman And this time his teeth scored ripping the tender and sensitive and flesh of all the inside of the first and second joints of Borckman s right hand Jerry s teeth were needles that stung and Borckman gaining the grasp on Jerry s jaw flung him away and down so that almost he hit the Arangi s tiny rail ere his clawing feet stopped him And Van Horn having finished his rearrangement and repair of the explosive filled drawer under the mate s bunk climbed up the companion steps saw the battle paused and quietly looked on But he looked across a million years at two mad creatures who had slipped the leach of the generations and who were back in the darkness of spawning life ere dawning intelligence had modified the chemistry of such life to softness of consideration What stirred in the brain crypts of Borckman s heredity stirred in the brain crypts of Jerry s heredity Time had gone backward for both All the endeavour and achievement of the ten thousand generations was not and as wolf dog and wild man the combat was between Jerry and the mate Neither saw Van Horn who was inside the companionway hatch his eyes level with the combing To Jerry Borckman was now no more a god than was he himself a mere smooth coated Irish terrier Both had forgotten the million years stamped into their heredity more feebly less eraseably than what had been stamped in prior to the million years Jerry did not know drunkenness but he did know unfairness and it was with raging indignation that he knew it Borckman fumbled his next counter to Jerry s attack missed and had both hands slashed in quick succession ere he managed to send the puppy sliding And still Jerry came back As any screaming creature of the jungle he hysterically squalled his indignation But he made no whimper Nor did he wince or cringe to the blows He bored straight in striving without avoiding a blow to beat and meet the blow with his teeth So hard was he flung down the last time that his side smashed painfully against the rail and Van Horn cried out Cut that out Borckman Leave the puppy alone The mate turned in the startle of surprise at being observed The sharp authoritative words of Van Horn were a call across the million years Borckman s anger convulsed face ludicrously attempted a sheepish deprecating grin and he was just mumbling We was only playing when Jerry arrived back leaped in the air and sank his teeth into the offending hand Borckman immediately and insanely went back across the million years An attempted kick got his ankle scored for his pains He gibbered his own rage and hurt and stooping dealt Jerry a tremendous blow alongside the head and neck Being in mid leap when he received the blow Jerry was twistingly somersaulted sidewise before he struck the deck on his back As swiftly as he could scramble to footing and charge he returned to the attack but was checked by Skipper s Jerry Stop it Come here He obeyed but only by prodigious effort his neck bristling and his lips writhing clear of his teeth as he passed the mate For the first time there was a whimper in his throat but it was not the whimper of fear nor of pain but of outrage and of desire to continue the battle which he struggled to control at Skipper s behest Stepping out on deck Skipper picked him up and patted and soothed him the while he expressed his mind to the mate Borckman you ought to be ashamed You ought to be shot or have your block knocked off for this A puppy a little puppy scarcely weaned For two cents I d give you what for myself The idea of it A little puppy a weanling little puppy Glad your hands are ripped You deserved it Hope you get blood poisoning in them Besides you re drunk Go below and turn in and don t you dare come on deck until you re sober Savve And Jerry far journeyer across life and across the history of all life that goes to make the world strugglingly mastering the abysmal slime of the prehistoric with the love that had come into existence and had become warp and woof
