Old Whitey the most ancient hen in the flock scrambled with some difficulty up to the top of the haymow in Farmer Green s barn She could scarcely keep up with Henrietta Hen whom she was following by request And when she arrived breathless at Henrietta s nest that proud and elegant creature turned a troubled face toward her See said Henrietta I ve taken your advice and laid another egg But it s nothing like the beautiful big white one This last egg is much smaller and it s brown Old Whitey nodded her head Well she said What s your difficulty Don t you think said Henrietta that if Johnnie Green finds my nest he ll be sure to take both eggs No I don t was old Whitey s blunt answer Then he ll be sure to take the big white one Henrietta Hen wailed No he won t old Whitey told her If he does I ll miss my guess Well that was really too much for Henrietta Hen to believe That boy will never take a little egg and leave a big one she declared You wait and see if he doesn t old Whitey advised her So Henrietta waited Though she had little faith in old Whitey s advice Henrietta could think of nothing else to do And the next morning to her great surprise when Johnnie Green climbed into the haymow and found her nest he took the small brown egg and put it in his hat And he never touched the big white egg at all He didn t even pick it up and look at it Perched on a beam overhead Henrietta Hen watched him breathlessly And as soon as he had gone she went flopping down to the barn floor and set up a great clamor for old Whitey What is it now old Whitey asked sticking her head inside the doorway Your guess was a good one cried Henrietta Hen He came and he took the small one There said old Whtiey I told you so I knew Johnnie Green wouldn t rob you of that big egg And if you keep laying small eggs in that same nest you ll find he ll let you keep the big one Henrietta Hen fairly beamed at her companion How delightful she exclaimed I ve become very very fond of that big egg I love to look at it But there s another thing that worries me now If that big egg should get broken Don t let that trouble you said old Whitey I m almost afraid to sit on my nest Henrietta Hen confessed If the shell of that egg should happen to be thin Old Whitey seemed much amused by Henrietta s fears Let me know if you break it she said And then she left Henrietta with her treasure I ll be very careful Henrietta called after the old dame wailed v wail She wailed over her father s remains The women of the town wailed over the war victims flopping n v flop The fish are still flopping about What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me doorway n They huddled in the shop doorway to shelter from the rain Mary suddenly appeared in the doorway delightful adj We had a delightful time by the seashore last Sunday Peter played a delightful melody on his flute dame n The dame tell of her experience as a wife and mother If you stick around you ll have to marry that dame
