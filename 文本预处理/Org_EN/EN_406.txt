Betty Harris sat very still her hands in her lap her face lifted to the breeze that touched it swiftly and fingered her hair and swept past Presently she looked up with a nod as if the breeze reminded her I should like to see Mr Achilles she said Not to day answered Miss Stone we must do the errands for mother to day you know The child s face fell I wanted to see Mr Achilles she said simply She sat very quiet her eyes on the lake When she looked up the eyes had brimmed over I didn t mean to said the child She was searching for her handkerchief and the little cherries bobbed forward I didn t know they would spill She had found the handkerchief now and was wiping them away and she smiled at Miss Stone a brave smile that was going to be happy Miss Stone smiled back with a little head shake Foolish Betty I didn t expect them said the child I was just thinking about Mr Achilles and they came just came They just came she repeated sternly She gave a final dab to the handkerchief and stowed it away sitting very erect and still Miss Stone s eyes studied her face We cannot go to day she said and to morrow we start for the country Perhaps she paused thinking it out But the child s eyes took it up and danced He can make us a visit she said nodding a visit of three weeks She smiled happily Miss Stone smiled back shaking her head He could not leave the fruit shop But the child ignored it He will come she said quickly and we shall talk and talk about the gods you know She lifted her eyes and we shall go in the fields He will come She drew a deep sigh of satisfaction and lifted her head And Miss Stone watching her had a feeling of quick relief She had known for a day or two that the child was not well and they had hurried to get away to the fields This was their last drive To morrow the horses would be sent on and the next day they would all go in the great touring car that would eat up the miles and pass the horses and reach Idlewood long before them No one except Betty and Miss Stone used the horses now They would have been sold long ago had it not been for the child The carriage was a part of her and the clicking hoofs and soft shining skins and arching necks The sound of the hoofs on the pavement played little tunes for Betty Her mother had protested against expense and her father had grumbled a little but if the child wanted a carriage rather than the great car that could whir her away in a breath it must be kept It made a pretty picture this morning as it turned into the busier street and took its way among the dark snorting cars that pushed and sped It was like a delicate dream that shimmered and touched the pavement or like a breath of the past and the great cars skimmed around it and pushed on with quick honk and left it far behind But the carriage kept its way with unhurried rhythm into the busy street and out again into a long avenue where great houses of cement and grey stone stood guard No one was in sight up and down its clear length only the morning sun shining on the grey stones and on the pavement and the little jingling in the harness and the joyous child and the quiet grey woman beside her I shall not be gone a minute Betty said Miss Stone The carriage had drawn up before the great shadow of a house She gave the child s hand a little pat and stepped from the carriage But at the door there was a minute s question and with a nod to Betty she stepped inside When the door opened again and she came out with quick step she glanced at her watch the errand had taken more than its minute and there were others to be done and they were late She lifted her eyes to the carriage and stopped The coachman from the corner of his eye waited for orders But Miss Stone did not stir Her glance swept the quiet street and came back to the carriage standing with empty cushions in the shadow of the house The coachman turned a stolid eye and caught a glimpse of her face and wheeled quickly his eye searching space There wa n t nobody he said He almost shouted it and his big hands gripped hard on the reins His face was grey There wa n t nobody here he repeated dully But Miss Stone did not look at him Drive to the Greek s You know where she went before She would not give herself time to think sitting a little forward on the seat of course the child had gone to the Greek to Mr Achilles They should find her in a minute There was nothing else to think about no shadowy fear that had leaped to meet the look in James s face when it turned to her The child would be there The carriage drew up before the shop with its glowing lines of fruit under the striped awning and Miss Stone had descended before the wheel scraped the curb her glance searching the door and the dim room beyond She halted on the threshold peering in A man came from the rear of the room his hands outstretched to serve her The dark clear face with its Greek lines and the eyes that looked out at her held a welcome You do me honour he said I hope Madame is well and the little Lady Then he stopped Something in Miss Stone s face held him and his hand groped a little reaching toward her You tell me he said But she did not speak and the look in her face grew very still He turned sharply calling into the shop behind him and a boy came running his eyes flashing a quick laugh his teeth glinting I go said the man with quick gesture You keep shop I go He had taken off his white apron and seized a hat He touched the woman on the shoulder Come he said She looked at him with dazed glance and put her hand to her head I cannot think she said slowly He nodded with steady glance When we go you tell we find her he said She started then and looked at him and the clear colour came to her face You know where she is But he shook his head We find her he repeated You tell And as they threaded the streets into drays and past clanging cars and through the tangle of wheels and horses and noise and she told him the story shouting it above the rumble and hurry of the streets into the dark ear that bent beside her The look in Achilles s face deepened but its steady quiet did not change We find her he repeated each time and Miss Stone s heart caught the rhythm of it under the hateful noise We find her Then the great house on the lake faced them She looked at him a minute in doubt Her face broke She may have come home she said I go with you said Achilles There was no sign of life but the door swung open before them and they went into the great hall up the long stairway that echoed only vacant softness and into the library with its ranging rows of perfect books She motioned him before her I must tell them she said She passed through the draperies of another door and the silence of the great house settled itself about the man and waited with him
