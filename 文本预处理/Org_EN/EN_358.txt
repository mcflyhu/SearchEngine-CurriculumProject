The affair of Hugh Massinger and Miss Champion s attitude towards it provided Eve with an experience that threw a glare of new light upon the life of a woman who sets out to earn her own living She had no need to go to the dramatists to be instructed for she had touched the problem with her own hands and discovered the sexual hypocrisy that Kate Duveen had always railed at Here was she lonely and struggling on the edge of life and a man of Hugh Massinger s reputation and intelligence could do nothing more honourable to help her than to suggest the advantages of a sentimental seduction Miss Champion the woman had failed to take the woman s part Her middle class cowardice was all for hushing things up for accusing the insulted girl of indiscretions for reproaching her with not failing to be a temptation to men No smoke without some fire It was safer to discharge such a young woman than to defend her And Miss Champion s nostrils were very shy and sensitive She was an automatic machine that reacted to any copper coin that could be called a convention Certain things never ought to happen and if they happened they never ought to be mentioned This affair inaugurated hard times for Eve nor did the bitterness that it aroused in her help her to bear the new life with philosophy It had had something of the effect on her that the first discovery of sex has upon a sensitive child She felt disgusted shocked saddened Life would never be quite the same at least so she told herself for this double treachery had shaken her trust and she wondered whether all men were like Hugh Massinger and all women careful hypocrites like Miss Champion She longed for Kate Duveen s sharp and acrid sincerity Hers was a personality that might take the raw taste out of her mouth but Eve did not write to Kate to tell her what had happened Her pride was still able to keep its own flag flying and it seemed contemptible to cry out and complain over the first wound One thing was certain her income had stopped abruptly She had about thirty five pounds left to her credit at the bank The rent of her rooms was a pound a week and she found that her food cost her about twelve shillings this sum including the sixpenny lunches and fourpenny teas that she had in the City Putting her expenditure at thirty five shillings a week she had enough money to last her for twenty weeks granted of course that nothing unexpected happened and that she had not to face a doctor s bill It behoved her to bustle round to cast her net here there and everywhere for work She entered her name at several Agencies but found that the agents were none too sanguine when she had to confess that she could neither write shorthand nor use a typewriter Her abilities were of that higher order whose opportunities are more limited People did not want artistic cleverness The need was all for drudges During her first workless week at Bosnia Road she designed a number of fashion plates and painted half a dozen little pictures She called at one of the despised picture shops and suggested to the proprietor that he might be willing to sell these pictures on commission The proprietor a depressed and flabby dyspeptic was not encouraging I could fill my window with that sort of stuff if I wanted to People don t want flowers and country cottages Can t you paint pink babies and young mothers and all that Eve went elsewhere and after many wanderings discovered a gentleman in the West Central district who was ready to show her pictures in his window He was a little more appreciative and had a better digestion than the man who had talked of babies Yes that s quite a nice patch of colour I don t mind showing them People sometimes like to get the real thing cheap What would one ask for a thing of this kind Oh half a crown to five shillings One can t expect much more Not so much as for a joint of meat He was laconic Well you see miss we ve all got digestions but not many of us have taste Her next attempt was to dispose of some of her dress designs and since she had become familiar at Miss Champion s with the names of certain firms who were willing to buy such creations she knew where to find a possible market It seemed wiser to call in person than to send the designs by post and she spent a whole day trying to interview responsible persons in West End establishments One firm rebuffed her with the frank statement that they were over supplied with such creations At two other places she was told to leave her designs to be looked at At her last attempt she succeeded in obtaining an interview with a hungry looking and ill tempered elderly woman who was writing letters in a little glass panelled office at the back of a big shop Eve disliked the woman from the first glance but she was grateful to her for having taken the trouble to give her an interview I wondered whether Messrs Smith might have any use for designs for new spring and summer frocks The woman looked at her from under cunning eyelids Sit down Let me see Eve unwrapped the drawings and handed them to the person in authority who glanced through them as though she were shuffling a pack of cards Had any technical training Not much I think I have lived in Paris That s an excuse I suppose There are one or two possible ideas here Leave the designs I ll consider them She laid them down on her desk and looked at Eve in a way that told her that she was expected to go I had better leave my address Isn t it on the cards No Then write it She pushed a pen and ink towards Eve and turned to resume the work that had been interrupted When Eve had gone the good lady picked up the designs looked them carefully through and then pushed the button of a bell in the wall behind her A flurried young woman with a snub nose and untidy yellow hair came in Here Miss Rush copy those two Then pack them all up and send them back to the address written on that one Say we ve looked at them and that none are suitable The snub nosed young woman understood and two of Eve s designs were appropriated at a cost to Messrs Smith of twopence for postage That was good business The whole batch was returned to Eve in the course of three days with a laconic type written statement that the designs had received careful consideration but had been found to be unsuitable She had not seen Mr Parfit since the loss of her secretaryship in fact not since Christmas the morning walks to Highbury Corner having become unnecessary On the afternoon of the second Saturday in January Eve happened to be standing at her window dressed to go out when she saw him strolling along the path on the other side of the road He glanced at her window as he passed and turning when he had gone some thirty yards came slowly back again A sudden hunger for companionship seized her a desire to listen to a friendly voice and to feel that she was not utterly alone She hurried out drawing on her gloves and found the Bourgeois of Clarendon Grove on the point of repassing her doorway He raised his hat beamed and came across Why here you are I hope you haven t been ill No I began to get quite worried It gave her pleasure to find that someone had troubled to wonder what had happened I have given up my post and so I have no reason for starting out early His round eyes studied her attentively Oh that s it He had sense enough not to begin by asking questions I was just going to take a breather round by the Fields Suppose you re booked for something No Well why shouldn t I tell you all about Christmas Jane s coming to look you up That s very good of her They started off together with a tacit acceptance of the situation Mr Parfit showing an elaborate politeness in taking the outside of the pavement His whole air was that of a cheery and paternal bachelor on his very best and most benignant behaviour And Eve without knowing quite why trusted him We had a gorgeous time down at Croydon I m so glad I enjoyed the chocolates and the books I suppose the sugar box was a great success Rather I had a joke with the kids I had two lots of presents one lot on top the other down below Up above there were two pairs of socks for Percy a prayer book for Fred a box of needles and cottons for Beatie and a goody goody book for Mab You should have seen their faces and the way the little beggars tried to gush and do the polite Oh uncle it s just what I wanted But it was all right down below They found the right sort of loot down there Eve laughed and was surprised at the spontaneity of her own laughter She had not laughed like that for many weeks I think you must be a delightful uncle Now do you really It really makes it seem worth doing you know You d like the kids I m sure I should They re little sports the lot of them She found presently that he was trying to turn the conversation towards herself and he man uvred with more delicacy than she had imagined him to possess She met the attempt by making a show of frankness I did not like my berth so I threw it up Meanwhile I am trying to do a little business in paintings and fashion plates while I look out for something else Suppose you are rather particular I don t want to take just anything that comes if I can help it Of course not You ve got brains I can t do the ordinary things that women are supposed to do type and write shorthand and keep books She noticed that his expression had grown more serious We re all for utility in these days you know Beastly unromantic world We can only get our adventures by reading novels I m sorry for the girls who have to work They don t get fair opportunities or a fair starting chance except the few who can afford to spend a little money on special education It s no fun supplying cheap labour I suppose not He drew a very deep and mind deciding breath No offence meant but if I can be of use at any time just give me the word It s very kind of you to say that Nonsense not a bit of it We are both workers aren t we Some days Eve got panic A great cloud shadow seemed to be drifting towards her and already she felt it chilling her and shutting out the sunlight She asked herself what was going to happen if she spent all her capital before she found a means of earning money regularly and she lay awake at night plotting all manner of schemes Her sense of loneliness and isolation became a black cupboard into which Fate shut her ever and again as a harsh nurse shuts up a disobedient child She thought of leaving Bosnia Road and of moving into cheaper quarters and she cut her economies to the lowest point Even Mrs Buss s face reflected her penuriousness for the florid woman was less succulently urbane and showed a tendency to be curt and off hand Eve had begun to realise what a great city meant with its agonies and its struggles It was like a huge black pool in which one went drifting round and round with thousands of other creatures clutching at straws and even at other struggling things in the effort to keep afloat There was always the thought of the ooze below and the horror of submergence Sometimes this troubled mind picture reminded her of the wreck of the Titanic with hundreds of little black figures swarming like beetles in the water drowning each other in the lust to live It was when the panic moods seized her that she was troubled by these morbid visions for one loses one s poise at such times and one s fears loom big and sinister as through a fog She had sold one picture in a fortnight and it had brought her exactly three and sixpence Her fashion plates were returned The various agencies were able to offer her situations as a domestic servant the reality being indecently disguised under the description of lady help She rebelled at the suggestion and even a panic mood could not reduce her to considering that particular form of slavery her pride turning desperate and aggressive and crying out that it would be better for her to indulge in any sort of adventure to turn suffragette and break windows rather than go into some middle class household as an anomaly and be the victim of some other woman s moods and prejudices Certain assertions that Canterton had made to her developed a sharp and vital significance It ought not to be necessary for sensitive women to have to go down and work in the shambles Money is a protective covering art a mere piece of beautiful flimsiness that cannot protect the wearer from cold winds and contempt The love of money is nothing more than the love of life and the harmony of full self expression Only amazing luck or a curious concatenation of coincidences can bring ability to the forefront when that ability starts with an empty pocket People do not want art but only to escape from being bored Most of those who patronise any form of art do so for the sake of ostentation that their money and their success may advertise themselves She realised now what she had lost in abandoning that life at Fernhill and she looked back on it as something very near the ideal green spacious sympathetic free from all the mean and petty anxieties a life wherein she could express all that was finest in her without having to dissipate her enthusiasm on the butter dish or the coal box It had meant protection and comradeship She was sufficiently human in a feminine sense to feel the need of them and there was a sufficiency of the clinging spirit in her to make her regret that she had gained a so called independence She was nearer now to discovering why some women are loved and others ignored Evolution has taught the male to feel protective and the expressing of this protective tenderness provides man with one of the most beautifying experiences that life can give The aggressive and independent woman may satisfy a new steel bright pride but she has set herself against one of the tendencies of Nature Argue as one may about evolving a new atmosphere of redistributing the factors of life this old fact remains The aggressive and independent woman will never be loved in the same way No doubt she will protest that her aim is to escape from this conception of love sexual domination that is what it has been dubbed and rightly so in the multitude of cases But a cloud of contentions cannot damp out the under truth The newmade woman will never challenge all that is best in man She will continue to remain in ignorance of what man is Even in her panic moments Eve could not bring herself to write to Canterton She felt that she could not reopen the past when it was she who had closed it She recoiled from putting herself in a position that might make it possible for him to offer her money One of the hardest parts of it all was that she had to live the whole time with her anxious economies She could not afford to escape from them to pay to forget A shilling was a big consideration a penny every bit a penny Once or twice when she was feeling particularly miserable she let herself go to the desperate extent of a half crown seat in the pit And the next day she would regret the extravagance and lunch on a scone and a glass of milk Then Mr Parfit appeared in the light of a provider of amusements One Thursday evening she had a note from him written in his regular commercial hand Dear Miss Carfax I have three dress circles for a matin e of The Lost Daughter on Saturday afternoon Jane is coming up from Croydon Will you honour me by joining us We might have a little lunch at Frascati s before the theatre I shall be proud if you accept and I want you to meet Jane Very sincerely yours John Parfit She did accept glad to escape from herself for an afternoon and refusing to ask herself any serious questions Mr Parfit was in great spirits Eve discovered Sister Jane to be a stout blonde good humoured woman with an infinite capacity for feeling domestic affection She studied Eve with feminine interest and meeting her brother s eyes smiled at him from time to time with motherly approval The play was a British Public play sentimentally sexual yet guardedly inoffensive Eve enjoyed it She found that John Parfit had to use his handkerchief and that he became thick in the throat She did not like him any the less for being capable of emotion It seemed to be part of his personality Afterwards they had tea together and Mr Parfit s benevolence became tinged with affectionate playfulness He made jokes teased his sister and tried to make Eve enter into a guessing competition as to which fancy cakes each would choose She appreciated his discretion when he put her in a taxi gave the driver four shillings and packed her off to Bosnia Road He himself was going to see Jane off at Charing Cross Also he and Jane had something to discuss Well old thing how does she strike you I m a cautious soul John but I m a woman and we re quick about other women She s the right stuff even if she s clever and a little proud It doesn t do a girl any harm to have a little pride Fine eyes too and good style I knew you d
