I put the finishing touches to Bettina s dress in our mother s room that night so that the invalid might have the pleasure of lying there and looking at Betty all white and golden in the candle light While I tied her sash I noticed her frowning at herself in the glass I look dreadfully missish she said When I protested she said Worse then Like a charity child at a school treat We were amazed My mother asked where she had got such ideas I heard Hermione behind Betty s voice She turned round and faced our mother with her most beguiling air It s going to be mine some day lend me the pearl and emerald pendant That my mother should be surprised at the suggestion seemed only natural But I could not see why she should be so annoyed I too begged her to let Bettina wear the pendant After all Bettina was in her seventeenth year and this was a real party [Pg ] A girl of sixteen wanting to wear a thing like that Bettina frowned How old must she be before she could wear the pendant My mother wouldn t say After Bettina had gone I asked about the market value of jewels My mother seemed to think the inquiry very odd and somehow offensive I asked if she thought the big diamond star was worth as much as She said I appeared to have a very sordid way of looking at things whose real value was that they were symbolic of something beyond price I said I knew that But did she not think that for some great and important end my father would have been the first to say let the jewels be sold My mother put her hand up to her eyes I blew out one candle and set a shield before the other She spoke my name and I started the voice sounded odd I went back to the bedside Are you ill I said She shook her head and motioned me to sit down [Pg ] Then she told me We were living on the proceeds of the diamond star The pendant had been sold last summer There was nothing more worth selling except the furniture and possibly a few prints We owed Lord Helmstone six months rent I met the shock with the help of my secret I steadied myself against the thought that at the worst I would find the means through Aunt Josephine or somebody for qualifying myself to support my mother and sister I saw myself at the worst a humble soldier enlisting in that army where Eric held command I too marching with that high companionship marching to the world s relief In the midst of telling how I was forging ahead with my London University Tutorial Correspondence and to what the year s successful work was leading I kept thinking that after all this ill wind might help to blow away the cloud that Eric s disapproval had brought lowering over the present and obscuring all the future My mother will be proud of me I thought She will even be a little touched and then for all the light was so dim I saw her face of horror [Pg ] It was a mad idea Her daughter a female doctor Never Not not female doctor I protested That does sound Well you see for yourself how the very sound of it I assured her that I didn t dislike the sound of medical woman But there was no necessity to emphasise woman at all the only thing important was whether the person was qualified to treat the sick People did not feel they had to say male doctor Doctor is enough I was told that the reason no one said male doctor was because doctor was male and everyone understood that I left the point and I pleaded my main cause with all my might I hadn t any accomplishments no music nothing I m not the decorative one and I like doing things plain everyday things There had to be people like that It was all no use That confession of mine more than hers about the jewels goaded my mother into taking a step which even we blind as we were felt to be epoch making in our history [Pg ] That same evening she began to talk about Aunt Josephine to excuse her Mrs Harborough had been so wrapped up in her brilliant young step brother and Aunt Josephine would never allow the step that any other person s coming in must inevitably have been resented She idolised your father A woman of high character Given to good works Busied about the redemption of long shoremen and about country treats for jam factory girls Knee deep in philanthropy And childless She could not especially now after that old first anger had long cooled she could not be indifferent to the fate of her brother s children Are you thinking of writing to her I said She explained that for her to address Mrs Harborough was under the circumstances hardly possible But there was no reason in the world why I should not I felt there were reasons but I could not think what they were My mother meanwhile grew almost cheerful outlining the sort of thing I might say No requests in this first communication A letter merely if it found her so inclined merely to open a long closed door I did not like my task I decided I would put it off till morning though I knew that at any time[Pg ] I should find it easier to write Please lend me for a course of study than write such a letter as my mother had dictated Betty came back from her dinner party in great excitement Ranny Dallas had motored over from Dartmoor that very day with a man friend They had been at the Helmstones to tea I wondered dully that Lady Helmstone had said nothing whatever about Ranny during her visit She must have just parted from him Another curious thing was that Ranny had not stayed for the dinner party He and his friend were at the inn What in the world do you think that means I asked Bettina glad enough to escape from my own thoughts She was smiling I think it is very natural And why was it natural for a luxurious young man to put up with tough mutton and watery potatoes at a village inn when he and any friend of his were certain of a welcome and the best possible dinner in a house like the Helmstones Betty merely continued to smile in that beatific [Pg ] but somewhat foolish fashion I said rather more to make her speak than for any soberer reason Perhaps he isn t so sure of his welcome and then in a flash I saw quite clearly something I had been blind to till that instant For all the liking the Helmstones felt for Betty they may not have liked being undeceived about Ranny s supposed devotion to Hermione That this idea had never occurred to me before showed me stupid I saw as well as self absorbed But the idea would not have occurred to me at all I think but for some of the things Lady Helmstone had said to my mother that afternoon Betty was asking me with a superior air if I couldn t understand that Ranny would prefer to talk things over before meeting her at a dinner party with everybody looking on She reminded me a little tremulously that it would be their very first meeting since There was a moment when I thought she was going to cry And then without any sense of transition I wondered how anybody in the world could be as happy as Betty looked The next morning still in a mood of the deepest[Pg ] dejection I dated a sheet of paper and began My dear Aunt Josephine I looked at the words for full five minutes with a feeling of intense unwillingness to set down another syllable And then I yielded to the impulse which made certain other words so easy so delicious to say or trace I took a fresh sheet Before I knew I had written Dear Mr Annan Well why not Was it not better to write to him rather than face another afternoon like yesterday My mother wondering suspicious my own eyes flying back and forth like distracted shuttles from window to clock from clock to window hour after hour Dear Mr Annan I have told my mother She feels as you do She
