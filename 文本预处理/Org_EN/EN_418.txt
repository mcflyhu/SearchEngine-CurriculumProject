What did you see boy Philip Harris stood with his legs well apart looking at him The boy answered quickly his quick gesture running to the picture above them and filling out his words He had gathered the story of the child as the mother had gathered his and his voice trembled a little but it did not falter in the broken words Philip Harris glanced up The rain on the skylight had ceased but the room was full of dusk There is not time he said to night You must rest now and have your dinner and go to bed To morrow there will be men to question you You must tell them what you have told us I tell them said the boy simply what I see So the boy slept quietly and through the night messages ran beneath the ground they leaped out and struck wires and laughed Men bent their heads to listen and spoke softly and hurried Cars thrust themselves forth striking at the miles their great bulk sliding on The world was awake gathering itself toward the boy In the morning they questioned him they set down his answers with quick sharp jerks that asked for more And the boy repeated faithfully all that he had told and the surgeon sitting beside him watched with keen eyes and smiled The boy would hold He was sound But they must be careful and after a little he sent him into the garden to work while the men compared notes and sent despatches and the story travelled into the world tallying itself against the face of every rogue But there were no faces that matched it no faces such as the boy had cherished with minute care as if the features had been stamped one flashing stroke upon his brain and disappeared There could be no doubt of them the description of the child was perfect red cherries grey coat and floating curls He seemed to see the face before him as he talked and the face of the big man at her left with red moustache and sharp chin and the smaller man beside her who had clapped his hand across her mouth and glared at the boy on the ground his eyes were black yes and he wore a cap pulled down and collar up you only saw the eyes black as The boy had looked about him a minute and pointed to the shoes of the chief of police gleaming in the sunlight patent leathers and dress suit hurried away from a political banquet the night before The men smiled and the pencils raced There had been another man who drove the machine but the boy had not noticed him his swift glance had taken in only the child it seemed and the faces that framed her A little later they drove into the city the boy accompanying them and the surgeon and Achilles who had hurried out with the first news and had listened to his son s story with dark silent eyes He sat in the car close to Alcibiades one hand on the back of the seat the other on the boy s hand Through the long miles they did not speak The boy seemed resting in his father s strength It was only when they reached the scene of his disaster that he roused himself and pointed with quick finger to the place where he had fallen He was pushing his cart so and he looked up quick and his cart went so and all his fruit and he was down looking up and the car went by close Which way He could not tell that no He shut his eyes his face grew pale He could not tell The street forked here it might have been either way by swerving a little And the police looked wise and took notes and reporters photographed the spot and before night a crowd had gathered about it peering hopefully at the pavement where Alcibiades had lain and pointing with eager fingers to bits of peel orange and banana scattered by the last passer by and gazing at dark stains on the pavement something that might be marks of blood after ten weeks of rain and mud and dust Achilles and the boy returned to the shop I want to go home the boy had said as the car turned away I go home with you father So they had drawn up at the little fruit shop and Yaxis in the door his teeth gleaming had darted out to meet them hovering about them and helping his brother up the stairs and out to the verandah that ran across the windows at the rear Down below in tin can backyards of the neighbours old bottles and piles of broken lumber filled the place but along the edge of the verandah boxes of earth had been set and the vines ran to the top shutting out the glare of the brick walls opposite and making a cool spot in the blank heat Alcibiades looked at the vines with happy eyes They grow he said softly Yaxis nodded and produced a pot of forget me nots He had been tending them for three weeks for Alcie They bent over the pot blue with blossoms talking eager words and little gestures and quick laughs And Achilles coming out smiled at the two heads bending above the plant Yaxis had been lonely but now the little laughs seemed to stir softly in the close rooms and wake something happy there What did you see boy Philip Harris stood with his legs well apart looking at him The boy answered quickly his quick gesture running to the picture above them and filling
