This chapter in our composite story falls to me not because I can write it better but because I was present at that strange interview which changed the whole face of the Harland case Even now I can feel the tightening of the muscles the horrified chill as we learned in one of the most unexpected and startling revelations ever made in a lawyer s office the true significance of the supposed suicide It was the morning after the night ride of Babbitts and O Mally and I was late at the office The matter had been arranged after I left the evening before and I knew nothing of it As I entered the building I ran into Babbitts who was going to the Whitney offices to report on his failure and in the hopes that some new lead might have cropped up Drawing me to the side of the hall he told me of their expedition I listened with the greatest interest and surprise It struck me as amazing and rather horrible Until I heard it I had not believed the story of the typewriter girl that Barker was in love with Miss Whitehall but in the face of such evidence I had nothing to say We were both so engrossed that neither noticed a woman holding a child by the hand and moving uncertainly about our vicinity It wasn t till the story was over and we were walking toward the elevator that I was conscious of her looking this way and that jostled by the men and evidently scared and bewildered Judging her too timid to ask her way and too unused to such surroundings she looked poor and shabby to consult the office directory on the wall I stopped and asked her where she wanted to go She gave a start and said with a brogue as rich as butter It s to L yer Whitney s office I m bound but where is it I don t know and it s afeared I am to be demandin the way with everyone runnin by me like hares I m going there myself I said I ll take you She bubbled out in relieved thanks and followed us into the elevator As the car shot up I looked her over wondering what she could want with the chief She was evidently a working woman neatly dressed in a dark coat and small black hat under which her hair was drawn back smooth and tight Her face was of the best Irish type round rosy and honest One of her hands clasped the child s his little fingers crumpled inside her rough red ones She addressed him as Dannie and when passengers crowded in and out drew him up against her with a curious soft tenderness that seemed instinctive He was a pale thin little chap eight or nine with large gray eyes that he d lift to the faces round him with a solemn searching look I smiled down at him but didn t get any response and it struck me that both of them woman and boy were in a state of suppressed nervousness Every time the gate clanged she d jump and once I heard her mutter to him not to be scared Inside the office Babbitts went up the hall to the old man s den and I tried to find out what she wanted Her nervousness was then obvious Shifting from foot to foot her free hand she kept a tight clutch on the boy fingering at the buttons of her coat she refused to say All I could get out of her was that she had something important to tell and she wouldn t tell it to anyone but L yer Whitney By this time my curiosity was aroused I asked her if she was a witness in a case and with a troubled look she said maybe she was and then backing away from me against the wall reiterated with stubborn determination But I won t speak to no one but L yer Whitney himself I went up to the private office where the old man and George were talking with Babbitts and told them George was sent to see if he could manage better than I had and presently was back again with the announcement I can t get a thing out of her She insists on seeing you father and says she won t go till she does Bring her in growled the chief and as George disappeared he turned to Babbitts and said Wait here for a moment I want to ask you a few more things about that girl last night Babbitts drew back to the window and I taking a chair by the table said laughing She s probably been sued by her landlord and wants you to take the case Maybe said the old man quietly I m curious to see Just then the woman came in the child beside her and George following She looked at the chief with a steady inquiring gaze and he rose as urbanely welcoming as if she were a star client You want to see me Madam I do she answered if you re L yer Whitney For it s to no one else I ll be goin with what I m bringin He assured her she d found the right man and waved her to a chair She sat down drawing the boy against her knee the chief opposite leaning a little forward in his chair all encouraging attention Well what is it he said It s about the Harland suicide she answered and it s my husband Dan Meagher who drives a dray for the Panama Fruit Company who s sent me here Go to L yer Whitney and tell him he says to me and don t be sayin a word to a soul not your own mother if she was above the sod to hear ye George who had been standing by the table with the sardonic smile he affects suddenly became grave and dropped into a chair The chief nodding pleasantly said The Harland suicide Mrs Meagher that s very good We d like any information you can give us about it The woman fetched up a breath so deep it was almost a gasp With her eyes on the old man she bent forward her words with their rich rolling r s singularly impressive It s an honest woman I am your Honor and what I ll be after tellin you is God s truth for me and for Dannie here who s never lied since the day he was born The little boy looked up and spoke his voice clear and piping after the fuller tones of his mother I m not lying Let s hear this straight Mrs Meagher said the chief I m a little confused Is it you or the boy here that knows something Him she said putting her hand on the child s shoulder he seen something It s this way your Honor I m one of the cleaners in the Massasoit Building The three top floors is mine and I go on duty to rid up the offices from five till eight It s my habit to take Dannie with me he bein as maybe you can see delicate since he had the typhoid and not allowed to go to school yet or run on the street I empty the trash baskets piped up the little boy Don t speak Dannie till your evidence is wanted said she On the evenin of the suicide L yer Whitney I was doin my chores on the seventeenth floor in the Macauley Blake Company s offices they bein as you may know at the back of the buildin I was through with the outer room by a quarter past six so I turned off the lights and went into the inner room closin the door as I had the window open and didn t want the cold air on the boy You left him in the room that looks over the houses to the front of the Black Eagle Building By the window spoke up the little boy I was leanin there lookin out That s it said she The office was dark and as I shut the door I seen him by the sill peerin over some books they had there She took the little boy s hand and fondling it in hers said Now Dannie tell his Honor what you saw same as you tolt Paw and me this day She turned to the chief It s no lie he ll be after sayin L yer Whitney I ll swear that on the Book The little boy raised his big eyes to the old man s and spoke clearly and slowly I was lookin acrost at the Black Eagle Building at the windows opposite On the floor right level with me they was all dark cept the hall one That was lit and I could see down into the hall and there was no one in it Suddent a door opened the one nearest to the window and a head come out and looked quick up and down and then acrost to our building Then it went in and I was thinkin how it couldn t see me because it was all dark where I was when the door opened again slow and an awful sort of thing came out He stopped and turned to his mother shrinking and scared She put her arm round him and coaxed softly Don t be afeart darlint Go on now and tell it like you tolt it to me and Paw at breakfast The old man was motionless his face as void of expression as a stone mask George was leaning forward his elbows on the table his eyes on the boy in a fixed stare What was it you saw Dannie said the chief his voice sounding deep as an organ after that moment of breathless hush Don t be afraid to tell us The boy spoke again pressing back against his mother It was like an animal creepin along crouched down Show the gentlemen said Mrs Meagher and without more urging the little chap slid down to the floor on his hands and knees and began padding about bent as low as he could It was a queer sight believe me the tiny figure creeping stealthily along the carpet and we four men all but the old man now up on our feet leaning forward to watch with faces of amazement That way he said looking up sideways Just like that awful quick from the door to the window He rose and went back to his mother cowering against her I thought it was some kind of bear and I was terrible scairt I was so scairt I couldn t raise a yell or make a break or nothin I stood lookin and I saw it was a man and He stopped terrified memory halting the words She had to coax again her arm around him her face close to his Go on Dannie boy you want the gintlemin to think you re the brave man that ye are Go on now lamb Over his head she looked at the chief and said It s a sight might have froze the heart of anyone let alone a pore sickly kid The boy went on almost in a whisper He had another man on his back still like he was dead with his arms hangin down I could see the hands draggin along the floor like they was bits of rope And when he got to the window quick I never seen nothin so quick the one that was creepin slid the other on to the sill He done it this way He crouched down on his knees with his hands raised over his head and made a forward shoving motion Pushing him out Just for a second I could see the dead one acrost the sill with his head down and then the other gave a big shove and he went over There was a moment of dead silence in which you could hear the tick of the clock on the mantel I had an impression of Babbitts his face full of horror and George bent across the table biting on his under lip Only the old man held his pose of bland stolidity And what did the man the one that was on his knees do then Dannie he asked gently He got up and made a break for the door Whisht he shot one palm across the other with a swift gesture like that and went in Which door was that which side Dannie waved his right hand This one the door he came out of this side The Azalea Woods Estates came from George The old man gave him a quick glance a razor sharp reproof and turning to Dannie held out his hand Well Dannie that s a wonderful story and it s great the way you tell it Let s shake on it The little boy stepped forward and put his small thin paw in the chief s big palm You ve told it to all the fellows on the block haven t you Dannie shook his head I ain t told it to a soul till this mornin when I couldn t hold it no more and let out to Paw and Maw Why didn t you tell I was scairt I didn t want to I kep dreamin of it at night and I didn t know what to do And this mornin when Paw and Maw was gassin about the suicide I just busted out I I his lips trembled and the tears welled into his eyes It s thrue what he says every word said Mrs Meagher It s sick he s been ever sence and me crazy not knowin what was eatin into him And this mornin he breaks into a holler and out it comes As she was speaking the old man patted the thin hand eyeing the child with a deep quiet kindliness You re a wise boy Dannie said he And you want to keep on being a wise boy and not tell anyone Will you answer a question or two saying when you don t know or don t remember I ll see that you get something pretty nice afterward if you do Yes says Dannie I ll answer Could you see what the man looked like the man that was alive No I wasn t near enough They was like like he paused and then said his eyes showing a troubled bewilderment like shadows He would have seen the figures in silhouette George explained black against the lit window That s it he turned eagerly to George And it was acrost the street and the houses on Broadway Um said the chief too far for any detail Well this man the one that went on his hands and knees was he a fat man The child shook his head No sir He he was just like lots of men Now look over these three gentlemen said the chief waving his hand at us Which of them looks most like him Not their faces but their bodies Dannie looked at us critically and carefully His eye passed quickly over Babbitts medium height broad and stocky lingered on me six feet two with the longest reach in my class at Harvard then brought up on George who tips the beam at one hundred and sixty pounds Most like him he said pointing a little finger at the junior member of Whitney Whitney Skinny like him Very well done Dannie said the old man then turned to George Lightly built He would have no means of judging height George took up the interrogation Could you see at all what kind of clothes he wore No he went too quick And he looked over at your building Yes but he couldn t have seen anything Maw s floors was all dark Did you see him come out of the room again No I was that scairt I crep away back to where Maw was Come in to me like a specter said Mrs Meagher And not a word out of him only that he was cold Well Mrs Meagher said the chief this is a great service you ve done us and it s up to us to do something for you Oh your Honor she answered it s not pay I m wantin It was my dooty and I done it Now Dannie boy it s time we was gettin home Wait a moment said the old man You say your husband s a drayman Tell him to come and see me my home s the best place this evening if possible And tell him and this applies as much to you his bushy brows came down over his eyes and his expression grew lowering not to mention one word of this If you keep your mouths shut your future s made If you blab he raised a warning finger and shook it fiercely in her face God help you Mrs Meagher looked terrified She clutched Dannie and drew him against her skirts It s not a word I ll be after sayin your Honor she faltered I ll swear it before the priest That s right I ll see the priest about it He suddenly changed straightened up and was the genial old gentleman who could put the shyest witness at his ease The little chap doesn t look strong New York s no place for him He ought to run wild in the country for a bit Ah don t be after sayin it she shook her head wistfully That s what the doctor tolt me But what can a poor scrubwoman do Not as much maybe as a lawyer can You leave that to me I ll see he goes and you ll be along All I ask in return is he put his finger on his lips just one word silence She tried to say something but laughing and pooh poohing her attempts at thanks he walked her to the door There there no back talk Hustle along now and don t forget I want to see Dan Meagher tonight Ask the clerk in the waiting room for the address Good bye He shook hands with her and patted Dannie on the shoulder A month on a farm and you won t know this boy Good bye and good luck to you As the door shut on her his whole expression and manner changed He turned back to the room his hands deep in his pockets his shoulders hunched his eyes under the drooping thatch of his hair looking from one to the other of us Well gentlemen he said Murder came from George on a rising breath Murder repeated his father A fact that I ve suspected since the
