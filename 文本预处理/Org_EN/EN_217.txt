Down in the lower hall were the men servants with their watchful eyes They showed us the drawing room door As we came in I was conscious again of Aunt Josephine s appraising look Then of the elaborate grey head turning towards an old man as if to ask Well what do you think of my nieces He had a red blotchy face The kind of red that is crossed by little purple lines like the tracery of very tortuous rivers on a map The lines ran zigzagging into his nose which was thick at the end round and shining He had no hair except a sandy fringe and his eyes which had no lashes looked as if he had a cold He was introduced as an old friend of mine but she forgot to tell us his name We heard him called Colonel Through all the scent we could not help noticing that he smelled of brandy I looked round for the beautiful foreign lady [Pg ] But I was prepared to find her late after seeing her idling at her door in a dressing gown so near the dinner hour There was only one other person A man of about thirty six Good looking I thought and not happy He had a clear face quite without colour The skin very smooth and tight His dry brown hair was thinning on the crown He had nice hands I noticed that when he stroked his close fitting moustache I did not like him because of his manner I did not know what was wrong with it Perhaps he was only absent minded But when I tried to imagine him talking to my mother I could not He was introduced first to Bettina The others treated him as if he were very important They talked about his new Rolls Royce which turned out to be a motor car The Colonel tried to get him to say how many times he had been fined for exceeding speed limit Then they talked about The Tartar How he was always late It would be a chance if he came at all Aunt Josephine was positive he would appear I wired to say it was all right Just as well perhaps if he doesn t come to night [Pg ] the good looking man said He would be in a devil of a temper Betty asked why would he They said because his favourite horse had been scratched Betty thought it was nice of him to be so fond of his horse But if it was only a scratch We did not know why they laughed But we laughed too We tried not to show how unintelligible the talk was I listened very hard I felt like a learner in a foreign tongue I understood the words but not the sentences The Colonel looked at his watch in a discontented way Then we went in to dinner I don t think we sat in the order Aunt Josephine had meant But the absent minded man who had taken me in refused to change or to let me I had the old Colonel on my left Aunt Josephine of course at the head The empty place was between her and Betty The table was glittering and magnificent We had little helpings of strange strong tasting food before the soup And caviar You like caviar the Colonel said I said I didn t know for in my heart I felt it looked repulsive [Pg ] Don t know caviar I said of course I had heard of it He asked where And I said In Shakespeare The old Colonel choked and they all laughed to see how apoplectic he looked all except Betty and me I caught Betty s eye She had that fiery rose in her cheeks I felt excited too and strange But I hoped they didn t notice Betty and I had agreed that we must try not to show how unused we were to the ways of a great London house So I made conversation I asked about the absent guest My good looking man pretended to be annoyed He called in his slightly husky voice across the table to Aunt Josephine Already she wants to talk about The Tartar I explained that I meant the foreign lady the very beautiful lady I had seen upstairs looking out of her door Again my man exchanged glances with Aunt Josephine He was smiling disagreeably Aunt Josephine did not smile at all But the old Colonel laughed his croaking laugh and said the lady upstairs expected people to go to her Does she expect dinner to go to her too Betty asked And something in their faces made[Pg ] Betty blush though she didn t know why as I saw I believed they were teasing Betty just for fun and to see that beautiful colour in her cheeks flicker and deepen So I leaned towards her and across the flowers and the dazzling lights I told her the foreign lady was not very well That was why she was not coming down The Colonel asked me why I thought the lady wasn t well So I said Because I saw the doctor going up to her They were all quite still for a second or two I looked at Aunt Josephine Why was it wrong to mention the doctor s visit Was she afraid of making these friends of the beautiful lady anxious about her My man still was smiling but not pleasantly I couldn t tell whether the strange noises the Colonel made were choking or laughing But I felt more and more miserably shy And I had no clear idea of why I should feel so unless it was that nothing these people said meant what it seemed to mean I could see that Betty was bewildered too We knew we should feel strange we did not know we should feel like this [Pg ] I was thankful when they all turned round and called out The Tartar had come after all He made no apology for being late nor for not having dressed He strolled in as if the place belonged to him a great broad shouldered young man in a frock coat He had a round black cannon ball of a head and his eyebrows nearly joined His moustache was like a little blacking brush laid back against the lip with the bristles sticking straight out But he seemed to be making this effect deliberately by pushing out his mouth like a pouting child or even more like a person with swollen lips I felt sure I could not have seen him before but there was something oddly familiar about him He nodded to the others When Aunt Josephine said My nieces he said Oh stared a moment and then as he lounged into the empty place said it had been a rotten race I thought how astonished my mother would have been at such behaviour Betty must have been thinking of her too for she put on our mother s manner It was a beautiful manner but it sat oddly on my little sister it made her seem more self possessed than she[Pg ] was She turned and said I think you must be Mr Whitby Dawson The young man stared Everybody stared He turned sharply from Betty to his hostess She shook her head But the yellow part of her big eyes had turned reddish She looked very strange A creepy feeling came over me I remembered she had been most eccentric twenty years ago Was eccentricity the sort of thing that grew worse as people grew older I looked round at the company and met the eyes of the neighbour on my right They were unhappy eyes but they reassured me What put such an idea into your head Aunt Josephine was asking Betty Because Betty said and she looked at the young man again only because I saw so many of your of Mr Whitby Dawson s photographs Really the young man said in a bored voice That was no doubt a great privilege My name s Williams In her embarrassment Betty turned to the man[Pg ] who sat between us He has even the little scar she said like a person defending herself Mr Whitby Dawson got his scar in a duel with a student at Heidelberg He studied at the University there part of one year Studied duelling the Colonel chuckled Our absent minded man was not absent minded any more He was listening with a look I could not understand as if he took a malicious pleasure in poor Betty s mistake Such a trifling slip to have taken the young man for Guy Whitby Dawson and yet it seemed to have put the company out of tune Or perhaps it was the loss of the race All except my man seemed to care very much about the lost race The Tartar in his annoyed voice told his hostess and the Colonel how it happened He leaned his elbow on the table and almost turned his back on poor Bettina I thought I could see that my man seemed not to like The Tartar and that gave me a kindlier feeling towards him I wondered what had made him unhappy I felt I wanted to justify Bettina to him I felt too that she would recover herself sooner if we broke the silence at our end So I said in[Pg ] a voice too low I thought for the others to hear that I also had noticed the resemblance to Mr Whitby Dawson Lower still he asked me how we came to hear of Mr of the gentleman in question Then Betty and I between us told about Hermione Helmstone s engagement only we did not of course give her name The faithless Whitby our man said with the tail of his eye on the young gentleman opposite As for him he tried to go on talking about Black Friar as though he heard nothing of the history being retailed on the other side But I had a feeling that he was listening all the time Bettina s loyalty to Hermione made her object to hearing Guy called faithless They would have had only a year between them And he said Mr Whitby Dawson said they couldn t possibly live on that He was miserable poor man I should say so Poor and miserable Oh you laugh Bettina protested But I saw a heart broken letter about the poverty that kept them apart and condemned him to run in single harness [Pg ] Single harness the husky voice said And he repeated it Single harness eh Bettina was recovering her spirits She said something about Duncombe And I don t know what reminded her of the collie dog story but she told it very well though she did pile it on She made me out an immense heroine and I am afraid I looked sheepish The husky voice said Good and Pretty cool The story seemed to remind him of something He looked at his plate and he looked at Bettina and me Betty was amused at having made me feel shy and she laughed that bubbling laugh of hers The Tartar turned his head He did not take away his elbow But he looked over his shoulder down on Bettina s apricot coloured hair The fillet showed the shape of her head It defined the satiny crown where the hair lay as close as a red gold skull cap The forget me nots and the little green leaves held all smooth and tight except the heavy shining rings They fell out and lay on her neck The Tartar stopped talking about the race [Pg ] He still ate his food condescendingly with one hand But he drank with great good will He called to the butler who had been going round with a gold necked bottle in a napkin He was to come back The Tartar said and fill the ladies glasses I said no Bettina said she too drank water The Tartar said Nonsense quite as though the matter were for him to decide The servant filled Bettina s tall vaselike glass Bettina looked alarmed Already she had displeased this dreadful Tartar once Ought I she telegraphed across to me I shook my head There is one woman in London The Tartar made a motion towards the head of the table one woman who s got a decent cellar The Tartar was almost genial He raised his glass to my aunt I approve of the new coiffure too Rippin The Colonel was not to be diverted from the subject of the wine Take an old man s advice he said to me It s a chancy sort of world Make sure of a little certain bliss He lifted his own glass and drained it [Pg ] The Tartar said something to Bettina which I could not hear She looked up at him with a kind of wonder in her eyes and with that fiery rose quite suddenly overspreading her face again She put out her hand to the tall glass hesitated and then looked at the head of the table Perhaps Bettina saw what all of a sudden was clear to me Aunt Josephine was like a huge grey hawk The head craning out the narrow forehead all grey crest the face falling away from the beak How she had changed from the days when she had a double chin The tilt of the outstretched head was exactly like a bird s Watching sideways watching for what The eye made me shrink It made Bettina set her lips obedient to the glass She looked apologetic over the rim at me Mine stood untouched I see you have a will of your own the voice on my right said in my ear The London way seemed to be that ladies did not leave the table while men smoked The talk was about wines but it flagged The Tartar kept looking at Bettina The fitful colour in her cheeks had paled again The scent of flowers and that[Pg ] other all pervading perfume mixed with the tobacco was making Bettina faint My man noticed it You aren t accustomed to smoke he said to Bettina and he twisted his cigar round on his fruit plate till he crushed out the burning But the others took no notice I was sure Bettina was trying hard to throw off her oppression I thought of our mother and the thought of her sent sharp aching through me Bettina and I looked at each other I knew by her lip she had great trouble not to cry Do you think I whispered to my man you could ask to have a window opened He said we would be going into the drawing room soon Drink that black coffee he recommended He seemed not unkind so I tried to think why he would not do so small a thing for us as ask to have a window opened Are the downstairs windows barred with iron too He looked sharply at me I believe so he said I thought it must be because of all the silver and valuables in the house But he glanced at me again as if he thought I was still wondering and[Pg ] might ask someone else Then he said he had heard it used to be a private madhouse This house He nodded You needn t say I told you That then was what I had been feeling The poor mad people who used to be shut up here they had left this uncanny influence behind A strangeness and a strain The Colonel was speaking irritably to one of the footmen Something had gone wrong with an electric light bulb over the sideboard Send for Waterson to morrow to attend to that No one but me seemed at all surprised to hear the Colonel giving orders in my aunt s house As I sat there in the midst of all the contending scents with the soft clash of silver glass and voices in my ears a train of ideas raced through my brain as crazy as any that could have been harboured here in the days when The letters that had come out of this house Eric had called demented All the windows were still barred [Pg ] What if it were a private madhouse still Before my eyes the watchful big footmen turned into keepers to the Grey Hawk and to the lady upstairs The doctor he was for those too dangerous to trust downstairs That was why they had laughed at my inquiry such callousness had familiarity bred The Colonel might be the proprietor of the house My aunt was well off No doubt they humoured her With a keeper dressed like a footman they allowed her certain liberties to write crazy letters in her harmless intervals friends to dine nieces to divert her They would do almost anything to keep that red look out of her eyes There is one thing I don t understand I began to say to the man at my side But he was nervous too and jumped down my throat Don t ask me questions I never passed an examination in my life he pulled out his watch And I ve got an engagement to keep in exactly three minutes time No wonder I stared One man comes when dinner is half done and one wants to go before the hostess had risen For my part I wanted him not to go I told him so [Pg ] Why he turned suddenly and faced me I said it was perhaps because I felt I knew him best Anyway I persisted don t go He hesitated Please don t go I said I was relieved when he said very well he would see it out For I knew had he gone my aunt would think I had driven him away There was a rustle and I saw Aunt Josephine rising My man left me instantly He went and opened the door As we filed out he turned towards my aunt I heard him whisper Je vous fais mes compliments madame He looked at Betty Aunt Josephine nodded But her face changed What was wrong For whom was that but I turned quickly and caught the yellow eyes leaving my back I was but But why What had I done The Colonel talked to Betty and The Tartar as he led the way back to the drawing room The other man still was behind with my aunt He seemed to be reassuring her His curious low voice kept going off the register At a break I heard the words Doucement enunciated with an emphasis that carried [Pg ] I kept thinking how all the softly draped windows had iron bars behind the silk In the drawing room my aunt was saying to The Tartar Oh yes Bettina sings and dances She sings I said Don t you skirt dance The Tartar asked Bettina looked sorry I can dance ordinary dances she said But what sort is a skirt dance The men made a semicircle round her to explain Betty said she hadn t done any skirt dances since she was a little girl Oh and what are you now the Colonel said grinning horribly They made Bettina tell about the action songs our mother had taught us in the nursery They asked her to do one Of course Bettina refused They re only for children she said with that little air borrowed from our mother The Tartar threw back his bullet head and roared The Colonel said they were sick in London of sophisticated dancing What they wanted was Bettina s sort Bettina shook her head [Pg ] The Grey Hawk said it was too soon after dinner But they went across the room towards the piano I was following when the man who had taken me in to dinner said This is a comfortable chair So I sat down He said something about the strangeness of London just at first It would pass away I told him I hoped Bettina would find it so As for me I was only staying till to morrow He looked so surprised that I explained I had to go back and take care of my mother You have never been to London since you were a child and you come all this way just for a few hours I came to take care of Betty I said She has never travelled alone He looked at me And you Oh I haven t either To morrow will be the first time But then I am older He said nothing for several moments I looked across the room to where I could see the back of Bettina s head between the bare crown of the Colonel and The Tartar s black bullet The Tartar was bending over towards Bettina Aunt[Pg ] Josephine sat near them facing the door and us My man looked up suddenly and saw the eyes of the Grey Hawk on us We must talk he said with a laugh or they will think we aren t getting on That isn t a comfortable chair after all He stood up I said it was quite comfortable While he was insisting a servant came in to speak to my aunt I caught a glimpse through the door of a footman going upstairs with a short fattish young man Too young I thought to be another doctor We went to the end of the room and we sat on a sofa near the fireplace one of those sofas you sink down in till you feel half buried I didn t like to say I hated it for he was taking so much trouble He put a great down cushion at my back as if I were an invalid There Now can you sit quite still for a few minutes As still as if I were taking your picture I said I supposed I could And must I look pleasant I laughed He hesitated and then How good are your nerves he asked Very good I boasted But he was grave Have you ever fainted [Pg ] Never I said a little indignantly Could you hear something very unexpected even horrible and not cry out You know something I thought of an accident to my mother You have news for me Careful he said in a sharp whisper You told me you could keep perfectly still If you can t I won t go on I begged him to go on and I kept my face a blank He turned his head slightly and took in the group at the other end of the room He sat so a moment with his eyes still turned away while he said Everything more than life depends on your self control during the next few minutes I sat staring at him Have you any idea where you are and still he looked not at me but towards the others My first bewilderment was giving way to fear No fear now of anything he could tell me Fear of the man himself I saw it all Not that iron grey woman who had left the room with the servant not the brilliant lady upstairs but the person who had set me thinking wild thoughts at dinner about barred windows and private lunatic asylums [Pg ] The man sitting not three feet way from me was mad I calculated the distance between me and the
