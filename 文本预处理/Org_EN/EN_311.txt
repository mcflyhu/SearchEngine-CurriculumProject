I did not profit by Alan s pilotage as he had done by his marchings under General Cope for I can scarce tell what way we went It is my excuse that we travelled exceeding fast Some part we ran some trotted and the rest walked at a vengeance of a pace Twice while we were at top speed we ran against country folk but though we plumped into the first from round a corner Alan was as ready as a loaded musket Hae ye seen my horse he gasped Na man I haenae seen nae horse the day replied the countryman And Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling ride and tie that our charger had escaped and it was feared he had gone home to Linton Not only that but he expended some breath of which he had not very much left to curse his own misfortune and my stupidity which was said to be its cause Them that cannae tell the truth he observed to myself as we went on again should be aye mindfu to leave an honest handy lee behind them If folk [pg ]dinnae ken what ye re doing Davie they re terrible taken up with it but if they think they ken they care nae mair for it than what I do for pease porridge As we had first made inland so our road came in the end to lie very near due north the old Kirk of Aberlady for a landmark on the left on the right the top of the Berwick Law and it was thus we struck the shore again not far from Dirleton From North Berwick west to Gillane Ness there runs a string of four small islets Craiglieth the Lamb Fidra and Eyebrough notable by their diversity of size and shape Fidra is the most particular being a strange grey islet of two humps made the more conspicuous by a piece of ruin and I mind that as we drew closer to it by some door or window of these ruins the sea peeped through like a man s eye Under the lee of Fidra there is a good anchorage in westerly winds and there from a far way off we could see the Thistle riding The shore in face of these islets is altogether waste Here is no dwelling of man and scarce any passage or at most of vagabond children running at their play Gillane is a small place on the far side of the Ness the folk of Dirleton go to their business in the inland fields and those of North Berwick straight to the sea fishing from their haven so that few parts of the coast are lonelier But I mind as we crawled upon our bellies into that multiplicity of heights and hollows keeping a bright eye upon all sides and our [pg ]hearts hammering at our ribs there was such a shining of the sun and the sea such a stir of the wind in the bent grass and such a bustle of down popping rabbits and up flying gulls that the desert seemed to me like a place alive No doubt it was in all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation if the secret had been kept and even now that it was out and the place watched we were able to creep unperceived to the front of the sandhills where they look down immediately on the beach and sea But here Alan came to a full stop Davie said he this is a kittle passage As long as we lie here we re safe but I m nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the coast of France And as soon as we stand up and signal the brig it s another matter For where will your gentry be think ye Maybe they re no come yet said I And even if they are there s one clear matter in our favour They ll be all arranged to take us that s true But they ll have arranged for our coming from the east and here we are upon their west Ay says Alan I wish we were in some force and this was a battle we would have bonnily out manoeuvred them But it isnae Davit and the way it is is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan Breck I swither Davie Time flies Alan said I I ken that said Alan I ken naething else as [pg ]the French folk say But this is a dreidful case of heids or tails O if I could but ken where your gentry were Alan said I this is no like you It s got to be now or never This is no me quo he sang Alan with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery Neither you nor me quo he neither you nor me Wow na Johnnie man neither you nor me And then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was and with a handkerchief flying in his right hand marched down upon the beach I stood up myself but lingered behind him scanning the sandhills to the east His appearance was at first unremarked Scougal not expecting him so early and my gentry watching on the other side Then they awoke on board the Thistle and it seemed they had all in readiness for there was scarce a second s bustle on the deck before we saw a skiff put round her stern and begin to pull lively for the coast Almost at the same moment of time and perhaps half a mile away towards Gillane Ness the figure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill waving with his arms and though he was gone again in the same flash the gulls in that part continued a little longer to fly wild Alan had not seen this looking straight to seaward at the ship and skiff [pg ] It maun be as it will said he when I had told him Weel may yon boatie row or my craig ll have to thole a raxing That part of the beach was long and flat and excellent walking when the tide was down a little cressy burn flowed over it in one place to the sea and the sandhills ran along the head of it like the rampart of a town No eye of ours could spy what was passing behind there in the bents no hurry of ours could mend the speed of the boat s coming time stood still with us through that uncanny period of waiting There is one thing I would like to ken says Alan I would like fine to ken these gentry s orders We re worth four hunner pound the pair of us how if they took the guns to us Davie They would get a bonny shot from the top of that lang sandy bank Morally impossible said I The point is that they can have no guns This thing has been gone about too secret pistols they may have but never guns I believe ye ll be in the right says Alan For all which I am wearying a good deal for yon boat And he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog It was now perhaps a third of the way in and we ourselves already hard on the margin of the sea so that the soft sand rose over my shoes There was no more to do whatever but to wait to look as much as we were [pg ]able at the creeping nearer of the boat and as little as we could manage at the long impenetrable front of the sandhills over which the gulls twinkled and behind which our enemies were doubtless marshalling This is a fine bright caller place to get shot in says Alan suddenly and man I wish that I had your courage Alan I cried what kind of talk is this of it You re just made of courage it s the character of the man as I could prove myself if there was nobody else And you would be the more mistaken said he What makes the differ with me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs But for auld cauld dour deidly courage I am not fit to hold a candle to yourself Look at us two here upon the sands Here am I fair hotching to be off here s you for all that I ken in two minds of it whether you ll no stop Do you think that I could do that or would No me Firstly because I havenae got the courage and wouldnae daur and secondly because I am a man of so much penetration and would see ye damned first It s there ye re coming is it I cried Ah man Alan you can wile your old wives but you never can wile me Remembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron I have a tryst to keep I continued I am [pg ]trysted with your cousin Charlie I have passed my word Braw trysts that you ll can keep said Alan Ye ll just mistryst aince and for a with the gentry in the bents And what for he went on with an extreme threatening gravity Just tell me that my mannie Are ye to be speerited away like Lady Grange Are they to drive a dirk in your inside and bury ye in the bents Or is it to be the other way and are they to bring ye in with James Are they folk to be trustit Would ye stick your head in the mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither Whigs he added with extraordinary bitterness Alan cried I they re all rogues and liars and I m with ye there The more reason there should be one decent man in such a land of thieves My word is passed and I ll stick to it I said long syne to your kinswoman that I would stumble at no risk Do ye mind of that the night Red Colin fell it was No more I will then Here I stop Prestongrange promised me my life if he s to be mansworn here I ll have to die Aweel aweel said Alan All this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers In truth we had caught them unawares their whole party as I was to learn afterwards had not yet reached the scene what there was of them was spread among the bents towards Gillane It was quite an affair to call them in and bring them over and the [pg ]boat was making speed They were besides but cowardly fellows a mere leash of Highland cattle thieves of several clans no gentleman there to be the captain and the more they looked at Alan and me upon the beach the less I must suppose they liked the looks of us Whoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain he was in the skiff himself steering and stirring up his oarsmen like a man with his heart in his employ Already he was near in and the boat scouring already Alan s face had flamed crimson with the excitement of his deliverance when our friends in the bents either in despair to see their prey escape them or with some hope of scaring Andie raised suddenly a shrill cry of several voices This sound arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted coast was really very daunting and the men in the boat held water instantly What s this of it sings out the captain for he was come within an easy hail Freens o mine says Alan and began immediately to wade forth in the shallow water towards the boat Davie he said pausing Davie are ye no coming I am swier to leave ye Not a hair of me said I He stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt water hesitating He that will to Cupar maun to Cupar said he [pg ]and swashing in deeper than his waist was hauled into the skiff which was immediately directed for the ship I stood where he had left me with my hands behind my back Alan sat with his head turned watching me and the boat drew smoothly away Of a sudden I came the nearest hand to shedding tears and seemed to myself the most deserted solitary lad in Scotland With that I turned my back upon the sea and faced the sand hills There was no sight or sound of man the sun shone on the wet sand and the dry the wind blew in the bents the gulls made a dreary piping As I passed higher up the beach the sand lice were hopping nimbly about the stranded tangles The devil any other sight or sound in that unchancy place And yet I knew there were folk there observing me upon some secret purpose They were no soldiers or they would have fallen on and taken us ere now doubtless they were some common rogues hired for my undoing perhaps to kidnap perhaps to murder me outright From the position of those engaged the first was the more likely from what I knew of their character and ardency in this business I thought the second very possible and the blood ran cold about my heart I had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard for though I was very unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade I thought I could do some scathe in a random combat But I perceived in time the folly of resistance This was no doubt the joint expedient [pg ]on which Prestongrange and Fraser were agreed The first I was very sure had done something to secure my life the second was pretty likely to have slipped in some contrary hints into the ears of Neil and his companions and if I were to show bare steel I might play straight into the hands of my worst enemy and seal my own doom These thoughts brought me to the head of the beach I cast a look behind the boat was nearing the brig and Alan flew his handkerchief for a farewell which I replied to with the waving of my hand But Alan himself was shrunk to a small thing in my view alongside of this pass that lay in front of me I set my hat hard on my head clenched my teeth and went right before me up the face of the sand wreath It made a hard climb being steep and the sand like water underfoot But I caught hold at last by the long bent grass on the brae top and pulled myself to a good footing The same moment men stirred and stood up here and there six or seven of them ragged like knaves each with a dagger in his hand The fair truth is I shut my eyes and prayed When I opened them again the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without speech or hurry Every eye was upon mine which struck me with a strange sensation of their brightness and of the fear with which they continued to approach me I held out my hands empty whereupon one asked with a strong Highland brogue if I surrendered [pg ] Under protest said I if ye ken what that means which I misdoubt At that word they came all in upon me like a flight of birds upon a carrion seized me took my sword and all the money from my pockets bound me hand and foot with some strong line and cast me on a tussock of bent There they sat about their captive in a part of a circle and gazed upon him silently like something dangerous perhaps a lion or a tiger on the spring Presently this attention was relaxed They drew nearer together fell to speech in the Gaelic and very cynically divided my property before my eyes It was my diversion in this time that I could watch from my place the progress of my friend s escape I saw the boat come to the brig and be hoisted in the sails fill and the ship pass out seaward behind the isles and by North Berwick In the course of two hours or so more and more ragged Highlandmen kept collecting Neil among the first until the party must have numbered near a score With each new arrival there was a fresh bout of talk that sounded like complaints and explanations but I observed one thing none of those that came late had any share in the division of my spoils The last discussion was very violent and eager so that once I thought they would have quarrelled on the heels of which their company parted the bulk of them returning westward in a troop and only three Neil and two others remaining sentries on the prisoner [pg ] I could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day s work Neil Duncanson said I when the rest had moved away He assured me in answer I should be tenderly used for he knew he was acquent wi the leddy This was all our talk nor did any other son of man appear upon that portion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the Highland mountains and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark At which hour I was aware of a long lean bony like Lothian man of a very swarthy countenance that came towards us among the bents on a farm horse Lads cried he hae ye a paper like this and held up one in his hand Neil produced a second which the new comer studied through a pair of horn spectacles and saying all was right and we were the folk he was seeking immediately dismounted I was then set in his place my feet tied under the horse s belly and we set forth under the guidance of the Lowlander His path must have been very well chosen for we met but one pair a pair of lovers the whole way and these perhaps taking us to be free traders fled on our approach We were at one time close at the foot of Berwick Law on the south side at another as we passed over some open hills I spied the lights of a clachan and the old tower of a church among some trees not far off but too far to cry for help if I had dreamed of it At last we came again within sound of [pg ]the sea There was moonlight though not much and by this I could see the three huge towers and broken battlements of Tantallon that old chief place of the Red Douglases The horse was picketed in the bottom of the ditch to graze and I was led within and forth into the court and thence into a tumble down stone hall Here my conductors built a brisk fire in the midst of the pavement for there was a chill in the night My hands were loosed I was set by the wall in the inner end and the Lowlander having produced provisions I was given oatmeal bread and a pitcher of French brandy This done I was left once more alone with my three Highlandmen They sat close by the fire drinking and talking the wind blew in by the breaches cast about the smoke and flames and sang in the tops of the towers I could hear the sea under the cliffs and my mind being reassured as to my life and my body and spirits wearied with the day s employment I turned upon one side and slumbered I had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened only the moon was down and the fire low My feet were now loosed and I was carried through the ruins and down the cliff side by a precipitous path to where I found a fisher s boat in a haven of the rocks This I was had on board of and we began to put forth from the shore in a fine starlight trotted trot She trotted her pony around the field Anne
