In January our little boy arrived to share our fate and to gladden our hearts As he was the first child born to an officer s family in Camp Apache there was the greatest excitement All the sheep ranchers and cattlemen for miles around came into the post The beneficent canteen with its soldiers and officers clubrooms did not exist then So they all gathered at the sutler s store to celebrate events with a round of drinks They wanted to shake hands with and congratulate the new father after their fashion upon the advent of the blond haired baby Their great hearts went out to him and they vied with each other in doing the handsome thing by him in a manner according to their lights and their ideas of wishing well to a man a manner sometimes alas disastrous in its results to the man However by this time I was getting used to all sides of frontier life I had no time to be lonely now for I had no nurse and the only person who was able to render me service was a laundress of the Fifth Cavalry who came for about two hours each day to give the baby his bath and to arrange things about the bed I begged her to stay with me but of course I knew it was impossible So here I was inexperienced and helpless alone in bed with an infant a few days old Dr Loring our excellent Post Surgeon was both kind and skillful but he was in poor health and expecting each day to be ordered to another station My husband was obliged to be at the Commissary Office all day issuing rations to troops and scouts and attending to the duties of his position But realizing in a measure the utter helplessness of my situation he sent a soldier up to lead a wire cord through the thick wall at the head of my bed and out through the small yard into the kitchen To this they attached a big cow bell so by making some considerable effort to reach up and pull this wire I could summon Bowen that is if Bowen happened to be there But Bowen seemed always to be out at drill or over at the company quarters and frequently my bell brought no response When he did come however he was just as kind and just as awkward as it was possible for a great big six foot farmer soldier to be But I grew weaker and weaker with trying to be strong and one day when Jack came in and found both the baby and myself crying he said man like What s the matter I said I must have some one to take care of me or we shall both die He seemed to realize that the situation was desperate and mounted men were sent out immediately in all directions to find a woman At last a Mexican girl was found in a wood chopper s camp and was brought to me She was quite young and very ignorant and stupid and spoke nothing but a sort of Mexican lingo and did not understand a word of English But I felt that my life was saved and Bowen fixed up a place on the couch for her to sleep and Jack went over to the unoccupied room on the other side of the cabin and took possession of the absent doctor s bed I begged Jack to hunt up a Spanish dictionary and fortunately one was found at the sutler s store which doubtless the sutler or his predecessor had brought into the country years before The girl did not know anything I do not think she had ever been inside a casa before She had washed herself in mountain streams and did not know what basins and sponges were for So it was of no use to point to the objects I wanted I propped myself up in bed and studied the dictionary and having some idea of the pronunciation of Latin languages I essayed to call for warm water and various other necessary articles needed around a sick bed Sometimes I succeeded in getting an idea through her impervious brain but more often she would stand dazed and immovable and I would let the dictionary drop from my tired hands and fall back upon the pillow in a sweat of exhaustion Then Bowen would be called in and with the help of some perfunctory language and gestures on his part this silent creature of the mountains would seem to wake up and try to understand And so I worried through those dreadful days and the nights Ah we had better not describe them The poor wild thing slept the sleep of death and could not hear my loudest calls nor desperate shouts So Jack attached a cord to her pillow and I would tug and tug at that and pull the pillow from under her head It was of no avail She slept peacefully on and it seemed to me as I lay there staring at her that not even Gabriel s trump would ever arouse her In desperation I would creep out of bed and wait upon myself and then confess to Jack and the Doctor next day Well we had to let the creature go for she was of no use and the Spanish dictionary was laid aside I struggled along fighting against odds how I ever got well at all is a wonder when I think of all the sanitary precautions taken now a days with young mothers and babies The Doctor was ordered away and another one came I had no advice or help from any one Calomel or quinine are the only medicines I remember taking myself or giving to my child But to go back a little The seventh day after the birth of the baby a delegation of several squaws wives of chiefs came to pay me a formal visit They brought me some finely woven baskets and a beautiful pappoose basket or cradle such as they carry their own babies in This was made of the lightest wood and covered with the finest skin of fawn tanned with birch bark by their own hands and embroidered in blue beads it was their best work I admired it and tried to express to them my thanks These squaws took my baby he was lying beside me on the bed then cooing and chuckling they looked about the room until they found a small pillow which they laid into the basket cradle then put my baby in drew the flaps together and laced him into it then stood it up and laid it down and laughed again in their gentle manner and finally soothed him to sleep I was quite touched by the friendliness of it all They laid the cradle on the table and departed Jack went out to bring Major Worth in to see the pretty sight and as the two entered the room Jack pointed to the pappoose basket Major Worth tip toed forward and gazed into the cradle he did not speak for some time then in his inimitable way and half under his breath he said slowly Well I ll be d d This was all but when he turned towards the bedside and came and shook my hand his eyes shone with a gentle and tender look And so was the new recruit introduced to the Captain of Company K And now there must be a bath tub for the baby The sutler rummaged his entire place to find something that might do At last he sent me a freshly scoured tub that looked as if it might at no very remote date have contained salt mackerel marked A One So then every morning at nine o clock our little half window was black with the heads of the curious squaws and bucks trying to get a glimpse of the fair baby s bath A wonderful performance it appeared to them Once a week this room which was now a nursery combined with bedroom and living room was overhauled by the stalwart Bowen The baby was put to sleep and laced securely into the pappoose basket He was then carried into the kitchen laid on the dresser and I sat by with a book or needle work watching him until Bowen had finished the room On one of these occasions I noticed a ledger lying upon one of the shelves I looked into it and imagine my astonishment when I read Aunt Hepsey s Muffins Sarah s Indian Pudding and on another page Hasty s Lemon Tarts Aunt Susan s Method of Cooking a Leg of Mutton and Josie Well s Pressed Calf Liver Here were my own my very own family recipes copied into Bowen s ledger in large illiterate characters and on the fly leaf Charles Bowen s Receipt Book I burst into a good hearty laugh almost the first one I had enjoyed since I arrived at Camp Apache The long expected promotion to a first lieutenancy came at about this time Jack was assigned to a company which was stationed at Camp MacDowell but his departure for the new post was delayed until the spring should be more advanced and I should be able to undertake the long rough trip with our young child The second week in April my baby just nine weeks old we began to pack up I had gained a little in experience to be sure but I had lost my health and strength I knew nothing of the care of a young infant and depended entirely upon the advice of the Post Surgeon who happened at that time to be a young man much better versed in the sawing off of soldiers legs than in the treatment of young mothers and babies The packing up was done under difficulties and with much help from our faithful Bowen It was arranged for Mrs Bailey who was to spend the summer with her parents at Fort Whipple to make the trip at the same time as our road to Camp MacDowell took us through Fort Whipple There were provided two ambulances with six mules each two baggage wagons an escort of six calvarymen fully armed and a guide Lieutenant Bailey was to accompany his wife on the trip I was genuinely sorry to part with Major Worth but in the excitement and fatigue of breaking up our home I had little time to think of my feelings My young child absorbed all my time Alas for the ignorance of young women thrust by circumstances into such a situation I had miscalculated my strength for I had never known illness in my life and there was no one to tell me any better I reckoned upon my superbly healthy nature to bring me through In fact I did not think much about it I simply got ready and went as soldiers do I heard them say that we were not to cross the Mogollon range but were to go to the north of it ford the Colorado Chiquito at Sunset Crossing and so on to Camp Verde and Whipple Barracks by the Stoneman s Lake road It sounded poetic and pretty Colorado Chiquito Sunset
