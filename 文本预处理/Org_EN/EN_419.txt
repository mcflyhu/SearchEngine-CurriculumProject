The next day life in the little shop went on as if there had been no break With the early light Yaxis was off to the south pushing his tip cart before him and calling aloud bananas and fruit and the joy of Alcibiades s return in his clear high voice In the shop Achilles arranged the fruit great piles of oranges and grape fruit and figs and swung the heavy bunches of bananas to their hooks outside and opened crates and boxes and made ready for the day By and by when trade slackened a little he would slip away and leave Alcibiades in charge of the shop His mind was busy as he worked He had something to do that would take him away from the shop every day for a while it might be but the shop would not suffer Alcibiades was strong not well enough perhaps to go out with the new push cart that had replaced the old one and waited outside but strong enough to make change and fill up the holes in the piles of oranges as they diminished under the swift rush of trade Achilles s eyes rested on him fondly It had been lonely in the shop but now the long days of waiting were repaid they had their clue Even now the detectives might have followed it up The little lady would be found He hurried over the last things his heart singing and called the boy to him I go away he said looking at him kindly You stay in shop till I come Yes father The boy s eyes were happy It was good to be in the close dark home place with its fruity smell and the striped awning outside I do all right he said gaily The father nodded To morrow you go with push cart little way every day little way He waited a moment while the boy s face took in the words he spoke with slow significance Some day you see those men then you run like devil he said quickly you tell me The boy s teeth made a quick line of light and his face flashed I tell quick he said I know those men He left the shop and was lost in the crowd He was going first to the city hall for news then he would seek Philip Harris The plan that he was shaping in his mind needed help But at the city hall there was no news The chief of police seemed even a little irritated at the sight of the dark face and the slim straight figure that stood before him He eyed it a moment almost hostilely then he remembered Philip Harris s command and told the man what steps had been taken and the reports that had come in thus far through the day The Greek listened without comment his dark face smouldering a little over its quick fire You find nothing he said quietly Not a damn thing answered the chief I go try said Achilles The man looked at him Then he laughed out The door opened It was the detective in charge of the case He glanced at Achilles and went over to the chief and said something But the chief shook his head and they looked carelessly at Achilles while the chief drummed on the desk Achilles waited with slow respectful gaze The detective came across to him No news he said Achilles s face held its steady light I think we find her he said The inspector did not laugh He studied the man s face slowly whistling a little between his teeth What s your plan he said Achilles shook his head When I see those men I go follow The detective smiled a little line of smile that did not scorn him When you see them yes he said softly The chief of police listening with half an ear laughed out Catch your hare Alexander He said it with superior ease Achilles looked at him I catch hair he asked with polite interest The chief nodded You catch your hare before you cook it you know Achilles ran a slim thoughtful hand along his dark locks and shook them slowly The conversation had passed beyond him The detective smiled a little Never mind him Alexander Anything that you find you bring to me right off He clinked a little money in his pocket and looked at him But Achilles s gaze had no returning gleam When I find her he said I tell you I tell everybody His face had lightened now The detective laughed All right Alexander You re game all right Achilles looked at him with puzzled eyes I go now he said He moved away with the smooth unhurried rhythm that bore him swiftly along The eyes of the two men followed him You re welcome to him said the chief carelessly I don t feel so sure said the other He may do it yet right under our noses I ve done it myself you know The chief looked at him curiously I used to do it time and again said the man thoughtfully I couldn t a told you how I d study on a case and study and give it up and then all of a sudden pop and there it was in my head I couldn t have told how it got there but it worked all right He lighted a cigar and threw the match from him puffing slowly I d do it now if I could He was lost in thought There s something in his eyes that Greek I d like to be inside that black skull of his a minute He sauntered across the room and went out The eyes of the chief of police looked after him vaguely He drew a column of figures toward him and began to add it starting
