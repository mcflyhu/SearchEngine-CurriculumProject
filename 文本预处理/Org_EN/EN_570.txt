Midnight a winter night black as Hades with great wind and whipping rain By the side of the Bidassoa in the midst of a confused extent of ground with treacherous soil that evokes ideas of chaos in slime that their feet penetrate men are carrying boxes on their shoulders and walking in the water to their knees come to throw them into a long thing blacker than night which must be a bark a suspicious bark without a light tied near the bank It is again Itchoua s band which this time will work by the river They have slept for a few moments all dressed in the house of a receiver who lives near the water and at the needed hour Itchoua who never closes but one eye has shaken his men then they have gone out with hushed tread into the darkness under the cold shower propitious to smuggling On the road now with the oars to Spain whose fires may be seen at a distance confused by the rain The weather is let loose the shirts of the men are already wet and under the caps pulled over their eyes the wind slashes the ears Nevertheless thanks to the vigor of their arms they were going quickly and well when suddenly appeared in the obscurity something like a monster gliding on the waters Bad business It is the patrol boat which promenades every night Spain s customs officers In haste they must change their direction use artifice lose precious time and they are so belated already At last they have arrived without obstacle near the Spanish shore among the large fishermen s barks which on stormy nights sleep there on their chains in front of the Marine of Fontarabia This is the perilous instant Happily the rain is faithful to them and falls still in torrents Lowered in their skiff to be less visible having ceased to talk pushing the bottom with their oars in order to make less noise they approach softly softly with pauses as soon as something has seemed to budge in the midst of so much diffuse black of shadows without outlines Now they are crouched against one of these large empty barks and almost touching the earth And this is the place agreed upon it is there that the comrades of the other country should be to receive them and to carry their boxes to the receiving house There is nobody there however Where are they The first moments are passed in a sort of paroxysm of expectation and of watching which doubles the power of hearing and of seeing With eyes dilated and ears extended they watch under the monotonous dripping of the rain But where are the Spanish comrades Doubtless the hour has passed because of this accursed custom house patrol which has disarranged the voyage and believing that the undertaking has failed this time they have gone back Several minutes flow in the same immobility and the same silence They distinguish around them the large inert barks similar to floating bodies of beasts and then above the waters a mass of obscurities denser than the obscurities of the sky and which are the houses the mountains of the shore They wait without a movement without a word They seem to be ghosts of boatmen near a dead city Little by little the tension of their senses weakens a lassitude comes to them with the need of sleep and they would sleep there under this winter rain if the place were not so dangerous Itchoua then consults in a low voice in Basque language the two eldest and they decide to do a bold thing Since the others are not coming well so much the worse they will go alone carry to the house over there the smuggled boxes It is risking terribly but the idea is in their heads and nothing can stop them You says Itchoua to Ramuntcho in his manner which admits of no discussion you shall be the one to watch the bark since you have never been in the path that we are taking you shall tie it to the bottom but not too solidly do you hear We must be ready to run if the carbineers arrive So they go all the others their shoulders bent under the heavy loads the rustling hardly perceptible of their march is lost at once on the quay which is so deserted and so black in the midst of the monotonous dripping of the rain And Ramuntcho who has remained alone crouches at the bottom of the skiff to be less visible becomes immovable again under the incessant sprinkling of the rain which falls now regular and tranquil They are late the comrades and by degrees in this inactivity and this silence an irresistible numbness comes to him almost a sleep But now a long form more sombre than all that is sombre passes by him passes very quickly always in this same absolute silence which is the characteristic of these nocturnal undertakings one of the large Spanish barks Yet thinks he since all are at anchor since this one has no sails nor oars then what It is I myself who am passing and he has understood his skiff was too lightly tied and the current which is very rapid here is dragging him and he is very far away going toward the mouth of the Bidassoa toward the breakers toward the sea An anxiety has taken hold of him almost an anguish What will he do What complicates everything is that he must act without a cry of appeal without a word for all along this coast which seems to be the land of emptiness and of darkness there are carbineers placed in an interminable cordon and watching Spain every night as if it were a forbidden land He tries with one of the long oars to push the bottom in order to return backward but there is no more bottom he feels only the inconsistency of the fleeting and black water he is already in the profound pass Then let him row in spite of everything and so much for the worse With great trouble his forehead perspiring he brings back alone against the current the heavy bark worried at every stroke of the oar by the small disclosing grating that a fine ear over there might so well perceive And then one can see nothing more through the rain grown thicker and which confuses the eyes it is dark dark as in the bowels of the earth where the devil lives He recognizes no longer the point of departure where the others must be waiting for him whose ruin he has perhaps caused he hesitates he waits the ear extended the arteries beating and he hooks himself for a moment s reflection to one of the large barks of Spain Something approaches then gliding with infinite precaution on the surface of the water hardly stirred a human shadow one would think a silhouette standing a smuggler surely since he makes so little noise They divine each other and thank God it is Arrochkoa Arrochkoa who has untied a frail Spanish skiff to meet him So their junction is accomplished and they are probably saved all once more But Arrochkoa in meeting him utters in a wicked voice in a voice tightened by his young feline teeth one of those series of insults which call for immediate answer and sound like an invitation to fight It is so unexpected that Ramuntcho s stupor at first immobilizes him retards the rush of blood to his head Is this really what his friend has just said and in such a tone of undeniable insult You said Well replies Arrochkoa somewhat softened and on his guard observing in the darkness Ramuntcho s attitudes Well you had us almost caught awkward fellow that you are The silhouettes of the others appear in another bark They are there he continues Let us go near them And Ramuntcho takes his oarsman s seat with temples heated by anger with trembling hands no he is Gracieuse s brother all would be lost if Ramuntcho fought with him because of her he will bend the head and say nothing Now their bark runs away by force of oars carrying them all the trick has been played It was time two Spanish voices vibrate on the black shore two carbineers who were sleeping in their cloaks and whom the noise has awakened And they begin to hail this flying beaconless bark not perceived so much as suspected lost at once in the universal nocturnal confusion Too late friends laughs Itchoua while rowing to the uttermost Hail at your ease now and let the devil answer you The current also helps them they go into the thick obscurity with the rapidity of fishes There Now they are in French waters in safety not far doubtless from the slime of the banks Let us stop to breathe a little proposes Itchoua And they raise their oars halting wet with perspiration and with rain They are immovable again under the cold shower which they do not seem to feel There is heard in the vast silence only the breathing of chests little by little quieted the little music of drops of water falling and their light rippling But suddenly from this bark which was so quiet and which had no other importance than that of a shadow hardly real in the midst of so much night a cry rises superacute terrifying it fills the emptiness and rents the far off distances It has come from those elevated notes which belong ordinarily to women only but with something hoarse and powerful that indicates rather the savage male it has the bite of the voice of jackals and it preserves nevertheless something human which makes one shiver the more one waits with a sort of anguish for its end and it is long long it is oppressive by its inexplicable length It had begun like a stag s bell of agony and now it is achieved and it dies in a sort of laughter sinister and burlesque like the laughter of lunatics However around the man who has just cried thus in the front of the bark none of the others is astonished none budges And after a few seconds of silent peace a new cry similar to the first starts from the rear replying to it and passing through the same phases which are of a tradition infinitely ancient And it is simply the irrintzina the great Basque cry which has been transmitted with fidelity from the depth of the abyss of ages to the men of our day and which constitutes one of the strange characteristics of that race whose origins are enveloped in mystery It resembles the cry of a being of certain tribes of redskins in the forests of America at night it gives the notion and the unfathomable fright of primitive ages when in the midst of the solitudes of the old world men with monkey throats howled This cry is given at festivals or for calls of persons at night in the mountains and especially to celebrate some joy some unexpected good fortune a miraculous hunt or a happy catch of fish in the rivers And they are amused the smugglers at this game of the ancestors they give their voices to glorify the success of their undertaking they yell from the physical necessity to be compensated for their silence of a moment ago But Ramuntcho remains mute and without a smile This sudden savagery chills him although he has known it for a long time it plunges him into dreams that worry and do not explain themselves And then he has felt to night once more how uncertain and changing is his only support in the world the support of that Arrochkoa on whom he should be able to count as on a brother audacity and success at the ball game will return that support to him doubtless but a moment of weakness nothing may at any moment make him lose it Then it seems to him that the hope of his life has no longer a basis that all vanishes like an unstable
