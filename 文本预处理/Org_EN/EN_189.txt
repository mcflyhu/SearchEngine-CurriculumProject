When she first glimpsed Bear Valley from the summits of the Blue Mountains it seemed to her a small paradise And as she rode lower and lower among the hills the impression gathered strength So she came out onto the road and trotted her cow pony slowly under the beautiful branches of the silver spruce and saw the bright tree shadows reflected in Bear Creek Surely here was a place of infinite quiet made for happiness A peculiar ache and sense of emptiness entered her heart and the ghost of Terry Hollis galloped soundlessly beside her on flaming El Sangre through the shadow It seemed to her that she could understand him more easily His had been a sheltered and pleasant life here half dreamy and when he wakened into a world of stern reality and stern men he was still playing at a game like a boy as Denver Pete had said She came out into view of the house And again she paused It was like a palace to Kate that great white facade and the Doric columns of the veranda She had always thought that the house of her father was a big and stable house compared with this it was a shack a lean to a veritable hovel And the confidence which had been hers during the hard ride of two days across the mountains grew weaker How could she talk to the woman who owned such an establishment as this How could she even gain access to her On a broad level terrace below the house men were busy with plows and scrapers smoothing the ground she circled around them and brought her horse to a stop before the veranda Two men sat on it one white haired hawk faced spreading a broad blueprint before the other and this man was middle aged with a sleek young face A very good looking fellow she thought Maybe you all could tell me said Kate Pollard lounging in the saddle where I ll find the lady that owns this here place It seemed to her that the sleek faced man flushed a little If you wish to talk to the owner he said crisply and barely touching his hat to her I ll do your business What is it Cattle lost over the Blue Mountains again No strays have come down into the valley I m not here about cattle she answered curtly enough I m here about a man H m said the other A man His attention quickened What man Terry Hollis She could see him start She could also see that he endeavored to conceal it And she did not know whether she liked or disliked that quick start and flush There was something either of guilt or of surprise remarkably strong in it He rose from his chair leaving the blueprint fluttering in the hands of his companion alone I am Vance Cornish he told her She could feel his eyes prying at her as though he were trying to get at her more accurately What s Hollis been up to now He turned and explained carelessly to his companion That s the young scapegrace I told you about Waters Been raising Cain again I suppose He faced the girl again A good deal of it she answered Yes he s been making quite a bit of trouble I m sorry for that really said Vance But we are not responsible for him I suppose you ain t said Kate Pollard slowly But I d like to talk to the lady of the house Very sorry and again he looked in his sharp way like a fox she thought and then glanced away as though there were no interest in her or her topic Very sorry but my sister is in er critically declining health I m afraid she cannot see you This repulse made Kate thoughtful She was not used to such bluff talk from men however smooth or rough the exterior might be And under the quiet of Vance she sensed an opposition like a stone wall I guess you ain t a friend of Terry s I d hardly like to put it strongly one way or the other I know the boy if that s what you mean It ain t She considered him again And again she was secretly pleased to see him stir under the cool probe of her eyes How long did you live with Terry He was with us twenty four years He turned and explained casually to Waters He was taken in as a foundling you know Quite against my advice And then at the end of the twenty four years the bad blood of his father came out and he showed himself in his true colors Fearful waste of time to us all of course we had to turn him out Of course nodded Waters sympathetically and he looked wistfully down at his blueprint Twenty four years you lived with Terry said the girl softly and you don t like him I see Instantly and forever he was damned in her eyes Anyone who could live twenty four years with Terry Hollis and not discover his fineness was beneath contempt I ll tell you she said I ve got to see Miss Elizabeth Cornish H m said Vance I m afraid not But just what have you to tell her The girl smiled If I could tell you that I wouldn t have to see her He rubbed his chin with his knuckles staring at the floor of the veranda and now and then raising quick glances at her Plainly he was suspicious Plainly also he was tempted in some manner Something he s done eh Some yarn about Terry It was quite plain that this man actually wanted her to have something unpleasant to say about Terry Instantly she suited herself to his mood for he was the door through which she must pass to see Elizabeth Cornish Bad she said hardening her expression as much as possible Well bad enough A killing to begin with There was a gleam in his eyes a gleam of positive joy she was sure though he banished it at once and shook his head in deprecation Well well As bad as that I suppose you may see my sister For a moment Just a moment She is not well I wish I could understand your purpose The last was more to himself than to her But she was already off her horse The man with the blueprint glared at her and she passed across the veranda and into the house where Vance showed her up the big stairs At the door of his sister s room he paused again and scrutinized A killing by Jove he murmured to himself and then knocked A dull voice called from within and he opened Kate found herself in a big solemn room in one corner of which sat an old woman wrapped to the chin in a shawl The face was thin and bleak and the eyes that looked at Kate were dull This girl said Vance By Jove I haven t asked your name I m afraid Kate Pollard Miss Pollard has some news of Terry I thought it might interest you Elizabeth Kate saw the brief struggle on the face of the old woman When it passed her eyes were as dull as ever but her voice had become husky I m surprised Vance I thought you understood his name is not to be spoken if you please Of course not Yet I thought never mind If you ll step downstairs with me Miss Pollard and tell me what Not a step answered the girl firmly and she had not moved her eyes from the face of the elder woman Not a step with you What I have to say has got to be told to someone who loves Terry Hollis I ve found that someone I stick here till I ve done talking Vance Cornish gasped But Elizabeth opened her eyes and they brightened but coldly it seemed to Kate I think I understand said Elizabeth Cornish gravely He has entangled the interest of this poor girl and sent her to plead for him Is that so If it s money he wants let her have what she asks for Vance But I can t talk to her of the boy Very well said Vance without enthusiasm He stepped before her Will you step this way Miss Pollard Not a step she repeated and deliberately sat down in a chair You d better leave she told Vance He considered her in open anger If you ve come to make a scene I ll have to let you know that on account of my sister I cannot endure it Really I m going to stay here she echoed until I ve done talking I ve found the right person I know that Tell you what I want Why you hate Terry Hollis Hate him murmured Elizabeth Nonsense cried Vance Look at his face Miss Cornish said the girl Vance by everything that s sacred your eyes were positively shrinking Do you hate him My dear Elizabeth if this unknown You d better leave interrupted the girl Miss Cornish is going to hear me talk Before he could answer his sister said calmly I think I shall Vance I begin to be intrigued In the first place he blurted angrily it s something you shouldn t hear some talk about a murder Elizabeth sank back in her chair and closed her eyes Ah coward cried Kate Pollard now on her feet Vance will you leave me for a moment For a moment he was white with malice staring at the girl then suddenly submitting to the inevitable turned on his heel and left the room Now said Elizabeth sitting erect again what is it Why do you insist on talking to me of him And what has he done In spite of her calm a quiver of emotion was behind the last words and nothing of it escaped Kate Pollard I knew she said gently that two people couldn t live with Terry for twenty four years and both hate him as your brother does I can tell you very quickly why I m here Miss Cornish But first what has he done Kate hesitated Under the iron self control of the older woman she saw the hungry heart and it stirred her Yet she was by no means sure of a triumph She recognized the most formidable of all foes pride After all she wanted to humble that pride She felt that all the danger in which Terry Hollis now stood both moral and physical was indirectly the result of this woman s attitude And she struck her deliberately cruelly He s taken up with a gang of hard ones Miss Cornish That s one thing The face of Elizabeth was like stone Professional thieves robbers And still Elizabeth refused to wince She forced a cold polite smile of attention He went into a town and killed the best fighter they had And even this blow did not tell And then he defied the sheriff went back to the town and broke into a bank and stole fifty thousand dollars The smile wavered and went out but still the dull eyes of Elizabeth were steady enough Though perhaps that dullness was from pain And Kate waiting eagerly was chagrined to see that she had not broken through to any softness of emotion One sign of grief and trembling was all she wanted before she made her appeal but there was no weakness in Elizabeth Cornish it seemed You see I am listening she said gravely and almost gently Although I am really not well And I hardly see the point of this long recital of crimes It was because I foresaw what he would become that I sent him away Miss Cornish why d you take him in in the first place It s a long story said Elizabeth I m a pretty good listener said Kate Elizabeth Cornish looked away as though she hesitated to touch on the subject or as though it were too unimportant to be referred to at length In brief I saw from a hotel window Black Jack his father shot down in the street heard about the infant son he left and adopted the child on a bet with my brother To see if blood would tell or if I could make him a fine man She paused My brother won the bet And her smile was a wonderful thing so perfectly did it mask her pain And of course I sent Terry away I have forgotten him really Just a bad experiment Kate Pollard flushed You ll never forget him she said firmly You think of him every day The elder woman started and looked sharply at her visitor Then she dismissed the idea with a shrug That s absurd Why should I think of him There is a spirit of prophecy in most women old or young and especially they have a way of looking through the flesh of their kind and seeing the heart Kate Pollard came a little closer to her hostess You saw Black Jack die in the street she queried fighting for his life Elizabeth dreamed into the vague distance Riding down the street with his hair blowing long black hair you know she reminisced And holding the crowd back as one would hold back a crowd of curs Then he was shot from the side by a man in concealment That was how he fell I knew murmured the girl nodding Miss Cornish I know now why you took in Terry Ah Not because of a bet but because you you loved Black Jack Hollis It brought an indrawn gasp from Elizabeth Rather of horror than surprise But the girl went on steadily I know You saw him with his hair blowing fighting his way he rode into your heart I know I tell you Maybe you ve never guessed it all these years But has a single day gone when you haven t thought of the picture The scornful indignant denial died on the lips of Elizabeth Cornish She stared at Kate as though she were seeing a ghost Not one day cried Kate And so you took in Terry and you raised him and loved him not for a bet but because he was Black Jack s son Elizabeth Cornish had grown paler than before I mustn t listen to such talk she said Ah cried the girl don t you see that I have a right to talk Because I love him also and I know that you love him too Elizabeth Cornish came to her feet and there was a faint flush in her cheeks You love Terry Ah I see And he has sent you He d die sooner than send me to you And yet you came Don t you see pleaded Kate He s in a corner He s about to go bad Miss Pollard how do you know these things Because I m the daughter of the leader of the gang She said it without shame proudly I ve tried to keep him from the life he intends leading said Kate I can t turn him He laughs at me I m nothing to him you see And he loves the new life He loves the freedom Besides he thinks that there s no hope That he has to be what his father was before him Do you know why he thinks that Because you turned him out You thought he would turn bad And he respects you He still turns to you Ah if you could hear him speak of you He loves you still Elizabeth Cornish dropped back into her chair grown suddenly weak and Kate fell on her knees beside her Don t you see she said softly that no strength can turn Terry back now He s done nothing wrong He shot down the man who killed his father He has killed another man who was a professional bully and mankiller And he s broken into a bank and taken money from a man who deserved to lose it a wolf of a man everybody hates He s done nothing really wrong yet but he will before long Just because he s stronger than other men And he doesn t know his strength And he s fine Miss Cornish Isn t he always gentle and Hush said Elizabeth Cornish He s just a boy you can t bend him with strength but you can win him with love What gasped Elizabeth do you want me to do Bring him back Bring him back Miss Cornish Elizabeth Cornish was trembling But I if you can t influence him how can I You with your beautiful you are very beautiful dear child Ah very lovely She barely touched the bright hair He doesn t even think of me said the girl sadly But I have no shame I have let you know everything It isn t for me It s for Terry Miss Cornish And you ll come You ll come as quickly as you can You ll come to my father s house You ll ask Terry to come back One word will do it And I ll hurry back and keep him there till you come God give me strength I ll keep him till you come Outside the door his ear pressed to the crack Vance Cornish did not wait to hear more He knew the answer of Elizabeth before she spoke And all his high built schemes he saw topple about his ears Grief had been breaking the heart of his sister he knew Grief had been bringing her close to the grave With Terry back she would regain ten years of life With Terry back the old life would begin again He straightened and staggered down the stairs like a drunken man clinging to the banister It was an old faced man who came out onto the veranda where Waters was chewing his cigar angrily At sight of his host he started up He was a keen man was Waters He could sense money a thousand miles away And it was this buzzard keenness which had brought him to the Cornish ranch and made him Vance s right hand man There was much money to be spent Waters would direct and plan the spending and his commission would not be small In the face of Vance he saw his own doom Waters said Vance Cornish everything is going up in smoke That damned girl Waters we re ruined Tush said Waters smiling though he had grown gray No one girl can ruin two middle aged men with our senses developed
