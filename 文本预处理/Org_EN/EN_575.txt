It is Easter night after the village bells have ceased to mingle in the air so many holy vibrations that came from Spain and from France Seated on the bank of the Bidassoa Ramuntcho and Florentino watch the arrival of a bark A great silence now and the bells sleep The tepid twilight has been prolonged and in breathing one feels the approach of summer As soon as the night falls it must appear from the coast of Spain the smuggling bark bringing the very prohibited phosphorus And without its touching the shore they must go to get that merchandise by advancing on foot in the bed of the river with long pointed sticks in their hands in order to assume if perchance they were caught airs of people fishing innocently for platuches The water of the Bidassoa is to night an immovable and clear mirror a little more luminous than the sky and in this mirror are reproduced upside down all the constellations the entire Spanish mountain carved in so sombre a silhouette in the tranquil atmosphere Summer summer one has more and more the consciousness of its approach so limpid and soft are the first signs of night so much lukewarm langour is scattered over this corner of the world where the smugglers silently manoeuvre But this estuary which separates the two countries seems in this moment to Ramuntcho more melancholy than usual more closed and more walled in in front of him by these black mountains at the feet of which hardly shine here and there two or three uncertain lights Then he is seized again by his desire to know what there is beyond and further still Oh to go elsewhere To escape at least for a time from the oppressiveness of that land so loved however Before death to escape the oppressiveness of this existence ever similar and without egress To try something else to get out of here to travel to know things Then while watching the far off terrestrial distances where the bark will appear he raises his eyes from time to time toward what happens above in the infinite looks at the new moon the crescent of which as thin as a line lowers and will disappear soon looks at the stars the slow and regulated march of which he has observed as have all the people of his trade during so many nocturnal hours is troubled in the depth of his mind by the proportions and the inconceivable distances of these things In his village of Etchezar the old priest who had taught him the catechism interested by his young lively intelligence has lent books to him has continued with him conversations on a thousand subjects and on the subject of the planets has given to him the notion of movements and of immensities has half opened before his eyes the grand abyss of space and duration Then in his mind innate doubts frights and despairs that slumbered all that his father had bequeathed to him as a sombre inheritance all these things have taken a black form which stands before him Under the great sky of night his Basque faith has commenced to weaken His mind is no longer simple enough to accept blindly dogmas and observances and as all becomes incoherence and disorder in his young head so strangely prepared the course of which nobody is leading he does not know that it is wise to submit with confidence in spite of everything to the venerable and consecrated formulas behind which is hidden perhaps all that we may ever see of the unknowable truths Therefore these bells of Easter which the year before had filled him with a religious and soft sentiment this time had seemed to him to be a music sad and almost vain And now that they have just hushed he listens with undefined sadness to the powerful noise almost incessant since the creation that the breakers of the Bay of Biscay make and which in the peaceful nights may be heard in the distance behind the mountains But his floating dream changes again Now the estuary which has become quite dark and where one may no longer see the mass of human habitations seems to him little by little to become different then strange suddenly as if some mystery were to be accomplished in it he perceives only the great abrupt lines of it which are almost eternal and he is surprised to think confusedly of times more ancient of an unprecise and obscure antiquity The Spirit of the old ages which comes out of the soil at times in the calm nights in the hours when sleep the beings that trouble us in the day time the Spirit of the old ages is beginning doubtless to soar in the air around him Ramuntcho does not define this well for his sense of an artist and of a seer that no education has refined has remained rudimentary but he has the notion and the worry of it In his head there is still and always a chaos which seeks perpetually to disentangle itself and never succeeds However when the two enlarged and reddened horns of the moon fall slowly behind the mountain always black the aspect of things takes for an inappreciable instant one knows not what ferocious and primitive airs then a dying impression of original epochs which had remained one knows not where in space takes for Ramuntcho a precise form in a sudden manner and troubles him until he shivers He dreams even without wishing it of those men of the forests who lived here in the ages in the uncalculated and dark ages because suddenly from a point distant from the shore a long Basque cry rises from the darkness in a lugubrious falsetto an irrintzina the only thing in this country with which he never could become entirely familiar But a great mocking noise occurs in the distance the crash of iron whistles a train from Paris to Madrid which is passing over there behind them in the black of the French shore And the Spirit of the old ages folds its wings made of shade and vanishes Silence returns but after the passage of this stupid and rapid thing the Spirit which has fled reappears no more At last the bark which Ramuntcho awaited with Florentino appears hardly perceptible for other eyes than theirs a little gray form which leaves behind it slight ripples on this mirror which is of the color of the sky at night and wherein stars are reflected upside down It is the well selected hour the hour when the customs officers watch badly the hour also when the view is dimmer when the last reflections of the sun and those of the crescent of the moon have gone out and the eyes of men are not yet accustomed to darkness Then to get the prohibited phosphorus they take their long fishing sticks and go into the water silently mingle vt vi If we mingle with the crowd we should not be noticed Oil
