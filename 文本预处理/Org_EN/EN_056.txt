Miss Pearl s question was awkward to answer on the spur of the moment as may be easily guessed Ralph had intended to lead gradually up to the object of his visit but thrown off his guard by the sight of the dress he had committed himself in a most untimely manner While thinking of a possible answer which would delay explanations he stared hard at Miss Pearl trying to guess what kind of a woman she was From the furnishing of the room from her looks and severe mode of dress he took her to be a religious woman of a Puritanic cast who had abjured the pomps and vanities of the world Yet she was a music hall dancer and that profession did not suit either her surroundings or her appearance I shall explain why I made that remark shortly said Shawe evading a direct reply as well as he was able and truth to tell my errand is not a very pleasant one Miss Pearl looked at the card she held in her large white hand and pondered thoughtfully Mr Ralph Shawe she said in her heavy voice Ah yes I remember now Perhaps Mr Ralph Shawe I can guess your errand Perhaps you can muttered Shawe wondering what she would say Sir Joseph Branwin pursued the dancer told me about you as an undesirable suitor for the hand of his daughter Am I right in assuming that you have called to enlist my sympathies Enlist your sympathies repeated the visitor staring Yes You want me continued Miss Pearl in a ponderously playful manner to ask Sir Joseph to permit you to pay your addresses I shall do so with pleasure as I have every sympathy with you and Miss Branwin Shawe still stared in a dazed way as this speech completely puzzled him and in vulgar parlance took the wind out of his sails Here he had come practically to accuse a lady of being connected with the murder of a woman whom she had wished to supplant and this very lady was now most generously offering her assistance to forward his private aims Shawe could not quite understand if this was cunning on Rosy Pearl s part or mere stupidity or perhaps the liberal offer of a generous nature He noted the careful way in which she spoke and her method of picking out well sounding words and mentally observed that she was doing her best to correct a defective education by thinking well before she spoke In the meantime Miss Pearl did not hurry him as she appeared to be a singularly leisurely person With her large calm eyes gazing amiably at him her gracious rounded figure and whole placid pose she reminded Ralph of nothing so much as a sacred white cow But cows can be furious when aroused and the barrister wondered if she would rise in her majesty like Bellona the goddess of war when she learnt the true meaning of his visit But she must be stupid he thought else she would have persisted in learning straight away the meaning of his first enigmatic remark Yet she accepted his postponement calmly and was quite ready to wait for an explanation I am greatly obliged to you for your kindness Miss Pearl he said quietly but I fear your offer of help is too late Sir Joseph has had a serious quarrel with his daughter A serious quarrel with his daughter repeated the woman slowly as if trying to get the idea well into her head then she added after a pause I should like to hear what the quarrel is about Ralph did not intend to tell her and he was sure Branwin would be too much ashamed of himself to give the information Well you know Miss Pearl that Sir Joseph wanted his daughter to marry Lord Anvers She refused him so Miss Branwin left the house as her father was so furious with her Miss Branwin has left the house And where is she staying now At the Pink Shop said Shawe promptly He was unwilling to name Audrey s temporary abode but did so to see what effect the name had on this calm and undemonstrative woman It had an effect indeed for Miss Pearl s white skin slowly became a vivid crimson and for the first time during the interview she displayed emotion Perhaps she was aware of the meaning in Shawe s gaze when he saw this agitation for she gave an excuse I don t think that the Pink Shop is a proper place for a young lady to stay at she remarked frigidly Why not You were there yourself Miss Pearl I have frequently been there Mr Shawe As an artist I have to take the greatest care of what looks I possess and I find Madame Coralie invaluable You slept at the Pink Shop on the night Lady Branwin was Miss Pearl displayed more agitation and a rare thing for so slow thinking a woman interrupted somewhat sharply I admit that I did but I do not wish it to be known For what reason Miss Pearl asked Ralph pressing his advantage mercilessly You can guess the reason Mr Shawe she replied with heavy indignation I know what evil minds people have Sir Joseph is an admirer of mine quite in a platonic way you understand Of course murmured the barrister I have heard of your unblemished reputation Miss Pearl I should think it was unblemished said the dancer speaking faster than usual My dear mother who was a consistent Baptist always warned me when I left home to keep myself unspotted from the world Circumstances have made me a music hall dancer but I have always conducted myself discreetly and I always shall do so Not by way of advertisement Mr Shawe but because the principles instilled by my dear mother will not permit me to behave in any other way It does you credit Miss Pearl murmured Ralph feeling called upon to say something polite Rosy Pearl looked at him like an offended goddess I do not know whether you mean to be sarcastic Mr Shawe but let me tell you that sarcasm is out of place Are you one of those men who do not believe that a woman can be virtuous in the midst of temptation Not at all Miss Pearl There are good women on the stage and often bad women in Church circles It is a question of temperament It is a question of doing what is right Mr Shawe said the goddess with a disdainful look I am a dancer it is true but no one can say a word against me I don t think anyone has said a word Ralph ventured to remark If they did said Miss Pearl sharply I would bring a libel action against them without delay My solicitors have instructions to take notice of any flippant remark made about me and to deal with it as it deserves With such precautions you must be like C sar s wife above suspicion I do not know Mrs C sar said Rosy Pearl coldly and betrayed her lack of educational knowledge in the remark I attend to my own business and to nothing else I daresay you wonder Mr Shawe why with these sentiments I am on the music hall stage Well Ralph admitted more and more puzzled by this simplicity but unable to tell if it were real or feigned I must say that I do wonder It s because I am stupid Stupid Shawe stared He had never heard a woman admit as much before Yes I am said Miss Pearl in her rich slow voice and looking more than ever like a sacred white cow My parents live in a small Essex village and have a large family My father is a carpenter and my mother as I told you a consistent Baptist Being poor we the children that is have to work and when I was eighteen I got a housemaid s place in London But I could not do the work It is not difficult work said Shawe marvelling at this candour No it is not difficult work said Miss Pearl who seemed to have a habit of repeating words perhaps to fix them in her memory but I am stupid and I was always making mistakes through forgetting things I lost place after place because of what was called my lack of intelligence I had to work in some way and yet I could not being too slow and heavy Then an old gentleman he was a scholar said that I resembled a Greek statue It gave me an idea as a friend of mine knew a music hall manager I went to this manager and asked him to let me appear in living pictures And he consented Not at once He admired me for my looks said Miss Pearl with great simplicity and he made love to me They all do and it is a great nuisance as I don t like that sort of thing But this manager became quite friendly when I boxed his ears He must have been an odd manager said Ralph thinking that so strong a white arm could hurt considerably Oh he was like the rest of them said Miss Pearl heavily However he declared that he saw possibilities in me and sent me to someone to be taught When I mentioned what the scholar had said about my being like a Greek this man he was a professor of dancing got an idea of reviving some Attic dances He taught me three chants Songs you mean No I do not mean songs I mean chants to which I dance You have seen my performance have you not Mr Shawe Yes and a very beautiful performance it is said Ralph He recalled the scene which represented a Greek temple before which Miss Pearl in scanty white robes danced in a slow and graceful manner chanting she was right the word was chanting stately words to solemn music Also she danced the Flower Dance of the Anthesterian Festival which was of a more lively character It is a very beautiful performance repeated Ralph emphatically I am glad you think so said Miss Pearl with a slow sweet smile Those three dances took me a year to learn I thought I would never master them but in the end I did Then I appeared and was a success I don t quite like the Greek dress added the dancer confidentially as it scarcely covers one but so long as I am respectable what does it matter Ralph laughed in a somewhat embarrassed manner He was beginning to like Miss Pearl because she was so childlike and unaffected I think you look perfectly respectable he said with a smile I am glad you think so said Miss Pearl once more She did not seem to have many ideas I get a good salary and for three years I have been dancing everywhere so I have saved money and I am able to help mother She was shocked at first being a consistent Baptist but now she is reconciled to the idea as she knows that I have never forgotten my early teaching But my success won t last for ever I am clever enough to see that so I intend to marry Sir Joseph Branwin and I hope to make him a good wife I am sure you will said Shawe heartily and felt as though he were encouraging a child You have known him long For two years He has always been a good friend to me although I have invariably kept him at arm s length But now that his wife is dead he wants to marry me And you say that you will marry him Miss Pearl looked at Shawe very directly I think I shall marry him but of course I may not I have not yet made up my mind But you said just now Yes I know what I said Mr Shawe But one can never be sure of anything in this world of trouble However it doesn t much matter if I marry him or not as I have saved a lot of money and I am quite content to go back to my village and live with my parents And now Mr Shawe that I have told you all about myself perhaps you will explain why you wish to see me Time was getting on and Shawe had learnt nothing definite as yet so he lost no further time but plunged into the middle of his reason for calling I wish to know if you saw anything when you stayed at the Pink Shop likely to lead you to suspect who is the assassin of Lady Branwin There said Miss Pearl colouring again I knew some day that I would be asked that question again Were you asked it before Yes Inspector Lanton asked me He learnt from Madame Coralie that I slept in the upstairs room and questioned me Of course I knew nothing as I was asleep all the time and I told him so I also asked him to keep my name out of the papers as such publicity would not have been good for me And now added Miss Pearl emphatically it would do me positive harm seeing that Sir Joseph wants to marry me People would say nasty things For instance that you wished Lady Branwin to die I daresay said Miss Pearl in quite a savage tone for so serene a goddess But let them that s all I have always my solicitors to look after my reputation Do you think that she asked suddenly No said Ralph frankly I might have entertained some such suspicion but after seeing you I do not suspect you in the least Still he paused you may know of something Know what for instance asked Miss Pearl sharply Ralph evaded an answer and asked another question Did you wear a Harris tweed dress when you were at the Pink Shop No I did not Why do you ask Because one of the assistants of Madame Coralie the blind girl whose sense of smell is abnormal scented the peaty fragrance of Harris tweed in the lower passage about the time Lady Branwin was murdered or at least one hour later Oh indeed said Miss Pearl coolly Then you think that I wore this dress and went downstairs to murder Lady Branwin so that I could marry No no I don t mean that I said that Parizade smelt the perfume an hour afterwards You say that you did not wear the dress but Sir Joseph always when in tweeds prefers the Harris cloth Was he in the house asked Miss Pearl bewildered That is what I wish you to tell me I can t She rose like an offended goddess And if he was I certainly should not tell you Mr Shawe If Sir Joseph knew that you dared to accuse him of murder He knows what I have told you Miss Pearl and knows also that I do not accuse him directly of murder But someone wearing Harris tweed was in the lower passage You deny wearing this dress and as Sir Joseph is partial to the cloth I conclude that he was lurking in the house He was certainly seen in the lane by Mrs Mellop I think said Miss Pearl frigidly that you had better tell this story to Sir Joseph himself I cannot assist you I was asleep in the upstairs room all the evening and I know nothing as I told Inspector Lanton As he is satisfied I do not see why you should not be Of course I take your word but There is no but about it interrupted the dancer imperiously and Ralph found himself thinking what a beautiful creature she was My mother always taught me never to tell a lie And if you think that I know anything of the crime Mr Shawe I shall prove my sincerity and ignorance by refusing to marry Sir Joseph Branwin Good day and she walked out of the room in as stately a manner as she had entered I wonder murmured Ralph leaving the house if she s a born liar or if she is
