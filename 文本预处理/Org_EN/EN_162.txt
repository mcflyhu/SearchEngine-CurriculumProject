She went straight down to the big living room and drew Vance away mindless of her guests He came humming until he was past the door and in the shadowy hall Then he touched her arm suddenly grown serious What s wrong Elizabeth Her voice was low vibrating with fierceness And Vance blessed the dimness of the hall for he could feel the blood recede from his face and the sweat stand on his forehead Vance if you ve done what I think you ve done you re lower than a snake and more poisonous and more treacherous And I ll cut you out of my heart and my life You know what I mean It was really the first important crisis that he had ever faced And now his heart grew small cold He knew miserably his own cowardice And like all cowards he fell back on bold lying to carry him through It was a triumph that he could make his voice steady more than steady He could even throw the right shade of disgust into it Is this another one of your tantrums Elizabeth By heavens I m growing tired of em You continually throw in my face that you hold the strings of the purse Well tie them up as far as I m concerned I won t whine I d rather have that happen than be tyrannized over any longer She was much shaken And there was a sting in this reproach that carried home to her there was just a sufficient edge of truth to wound her Had there been much light she could have read his face the dimness of the hall was saving Vance and he knew it God knows I d like to believe that you haven t had anything to do with it But you and I are the only two people in the world who know the secret of it He pretended to guess It s something about Terence Something about his father Again she was disarmed If he were guilty it was strange that he should approach the subject so openly And she began to doubt Vance he knows everything Everything except the real name of Black Jack Good heavens She strained her eyes through the shadows to make out his real expression but there seemed to be a real horror in his restrained whisper It isn t possible Elizabeth It came in that letter That letter I wanted to open and which you persuaded me not to She mustered all her damning facts one after another And it was postmarked from Craterville Vance you have been in Craterville lately He seemed to consider Could I have told anyone Could I possibly No Elizabeth I ll give you my word of honor that I ve never spoken a syllable about that subject to anyone Ah but what have you written I ve never put pen to paper But how did it happen He had control of himself now His voice was steadier He could feel her recede from her aggressiveness It was dated after you left Craterville of course And I can t stand imagining that you could be so low Only who else would have a motive But how was it done They sent him an article about his father and a picture of Black Jack that happens to look as much like Terry as two peas Then I have it If the picture looks like Terry someone took it for granted that he d be interested in the similarity That s why it was sent Unless they told him that he was really Black Jack s son Did the person who sent the letter do that There was no letter Only a magazine clipping and the photograph of the painting They were both silent Plainly she had dismissed all idea of her brother s guilt But what are we going to do Elizabeth And how has he taken it Like poison Vance He he burned all the Colby pictures Oh Vance twenty four years of work are thrown away Nonsense This will all straighten out I m glad he s found out Sooner or later he was pretty sure to Such things will come to light Vance you ll help me You ll forgive me for accusing you and you ll help me to keep Terry in hand for the next few days You see he declared that he will not be ashamed of his father You can t blame him for that God knows I blame no one but myself I ll help you with every ounce of strength in my mind and body my dear She pressed his hand in silence I m going up to talk with him now he said I m going to do what I can with him You go in and talk And don t let them see that anything is wrong The door had not been locked again He entered at the call of Terry and found him leaning over the hearth stirring up the pile of charred paper to make it burn more freely A shadow crossed the face of Terry as he saw his visitor but he banished it at once and rose to greet him In his heart Vance was a little moved He went straight to the younger man and took his hand Elizabeth has told me he said gently and he looked with a moist eye into the face of the man who if his plans worked out would be either murderer or murdered before the close of the next day I am very sorry Terence I thought you came to congratulate me said Terry withdrawing his hand Congratulate you echoed Vance with unaffected astonishment For having learned the truth said Terry Also for having a father who was a strong man Vance could not resist the opening In a way I suppose he was he said dryly And if you look at it in that way I do congratulate you Terence You ve always hated me Uncle Vance Terry declared I ve known it all these years And I ll do without your congratulations You re wrong Terry said Vance He kept his voice mild You re very wrong But I m old enough not to take offense at what a young spitfire says I suppose you are retorted Terry in a tone which implied that he himself would never reach that age And when a few years run by went on Vance you ll change your viewpoint In the meantime my boy let me give you this warning No matter what you think about me it is Elizabeth who counts Thanks You need have no fear about my attitude to Aunt Elizabeth You ought to know that I love her and respect her Exactly But you re headstrong Terry Very headstrong And so is Elizabeth Take your own case She took you into the family for the sake of a theory Did you know that The boy stiffened A theory Quite so She wished to prove that blood after all was more talk than a vital influence So she took you in and gave you an imaginary line of ancestors with which you were entirely contented But after all it has been twenty four years of theory rather than twenty four years of Terry You understand It s a rather nasty thing to hear said Terence huskily Perhaps you re right I don t know Perhaps you re right And if her theory is proved wrong look out Terry She ll throw you out of her life without a second thought Is that a threat My dear boy not by any means You think I have hated you Not at all I have simply been indifferent Now that you are in more or less trouble you see that I come to you And hereafter if there should be a crisis you will see who is your true friend Now good night He had saved his most gracious speech until the very end and after it he retired at once to leave Terence with the pleasant memory in his mind For he had in his mind the idea of a perfect crime for which he would not be punished He would turn Terry into a corpse or a killer and in either case the youngster would never dream who had dealt the blow No wonder then as he went downstairs that he stepped onto the veranda for a few moments The moon was just up beyond Mount Discovery the valley
