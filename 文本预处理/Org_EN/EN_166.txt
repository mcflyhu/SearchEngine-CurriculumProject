Terence Hollis had gone out of the room and up the stairs like a man stunned or walking in his sleep Not until he stepped into the familiar room did the blood begin to return to his face and with the warmth there was a growing sensation of uneasiness Something was wrong Something had to be righted Gradually his mind cleared The thing that was wrong was that the man who had killed his father was now under the same roof with him had shaken his hand had sat in bland complacency and looked in his face and told of the butchery Butchery it was according to Terry s standards For the sake of the price on the head of the outlaw young Minter had shoved his rifle across a window sill taken his aim and with no risk to himself had shot down the wild rider His heart stood up in his throat with revulsion at the thought of it Murder horrible and cold blooded the more horrible because it was legal Something had to be done What was it And when he turned what he saw was the gun cabinet with a shimmer of light on the barrels Then he knew He selected his favorite Colt and drew it out It was loaded and the action in perfect condition Many and many an hour he had practiced and blazed away hundreds of rounds of ammunition with it It responded to his touch like a muscular part of his own body He shoved it under his coat and walking down the stairs again the chill of the steel worked through to his flesh He went back to the kitchen and called out Wu Chi The latter came shuffling in his slippers nodding grinning in anticipation of compliments Wu came the short demand can you keep your mouth shut and do what you re told to do Wu try said the Chinaman grave as a yellow image instantly Then go to the living room and tell Mr Gainor and Sheriff Minter that Mr Harkness is waiting for them outside and wishes to see them on business of the most urgent nature It will only be the matter of a moment Now go Gainor and the sheriff Don t forget He received a scared glance and then went out onto the veranda and sat down to wait That was the right way he felt His father would have called the sheriff to the door in a similar situation and after one brief challenge they would have gone for their guns But there was another way and that was the way of the Colbys Their way was right They lived like gentlemen and above all they fought always like gentlemen Presently the screen door opened squeaked twice and then closed with a hum of the screen as it slammed Steps approached him He got up from the chair and faced them Gainor and the sheriff The sheriff had instinctively put on his hat like a man who does not understand the open air with an uncovered head But Gainor was uncovered and his white hair glimmered He was a tall courtly old fellow His ceremonious address had won him much political influence Men said that Gainor was courteous to a dog not because he respected the dog but because he wanted to practice for a man He had always the correct rejoinder always did the right thing He had a thin stern face and a hawk nose that gave him a cast of ferocity in certain aspects It was to him that Terry addressed himself Mr Gainor he said I m sorry to have sent in a false message But my business is very urgent and I have a very particular reason for not wishing to have it known that I have called you out The moment he rose out of the chair and faced them Gainor had stopped short He was quite capable of fast thinking and now his glance flickered from Terry to the sheriff and back again It was plain that he had shrewd suspicions as to the purpose behind that call The sheriff was merely confused He flushed as much as his tanned leather skin permitted As for Terry the moment his glance fell on the sheriff he felt his muscles jump into hard ridges and an almost uncontrollable desire to go at the throat of the other seized him He quelled that desire and fought it back with a chill of fear My father s blood working out he thought to himself And he fastened his attention on Mr Gainor and tried to shut the picture of the sheriff out of his brain But the desire to leap at the tall man was as consuming as the passion for water in the desert And with a shudder of horror he found himself without a moral scruple Just behind the thin partition of his will power there was a raging fury to get at Joe Minter He wanted to kill He wanted to snuff that life out as the life of Black Jack Hollis had been snuffed He excluded the sheriff deliberately from his attention and turned fully upon Gainor Mr Gainor will you be kind enough to go over to that grove of spruce where the three of us can talk without any danger of interruption Of course that speech revealed everything Gainor stiffened a little and the tuft of beard which ran down to a point on his chin quivered and jutted out The sheriff seemed to feel nothing more than a mild surprise and curiosity And the three went silently side by side under the spruce They were glorious trees strong of trunk and nobly proportioned Their tops were silver bright in the sunshine Through the lower branches the light was filtered through layer after layer of shadow until on the ground there were only a few patches of light here and there and these were no brighter than silver moonshine and seemed to be without heat Indeed in the mild shadow among the trees lay the chill of the mountain air which seems to lurk in covert places waiting for the night It might have been this chill that made Terry button his coat closer about him and tremble a little as he entered the shadow The great trunks shut out the world in a scattered wall There was a narrow opening here among the trees at the very center The three were in a sort of gorge of which the solemn spruce trees furnished the sides the cold blue of the mountain skies was just above the lofty tree tips and the wind kept the pure fragrance of the evergreens stirring about them The odor is the soul of the mountains A great surety had come to Terry that this was the last place he would ever see on earth He was about to die and he was glad in a dim sort of way that he should die in a place so beautiful He looked at the sheriff who stood calm but puzzled and at Gainor who was very grave indeed and returned his look with one of infinite pity as though he knew and understood and acquiesced but was deeply grieved that it must be so Gentlemen said Terry making his voice light and cheerful as he felt that the voice of a Colby should be at such a time being about to die I suppose you understand why I have asked you to come here Yes nodded Gainor But I m damned if I do said the sheriff frankly Terry looked upon him coldly He felt that he had not the slightest chance of killing this professional manslayer but at least he would do his best for the sake of Black Jack s memory But to think that his life his mind his soul all that was dear to him and all that he was dear to should ever lie at the command of the trigger of this hard crafty vain and unimportant fellow He writhed at the thought It made him stand stiffer His chin went up He grew literally taller before their eyes and such a look came on his face that the sheriff instinctively fell back a pace Mr Gainor said Terry as though his contempt for the sheriff was too great to permit his speaking directly to Minter will you explain to the sheriff that my determination to have satisfaction does not come from the fact that he killed my father but because of the manner of the killing To the sheriff it seems justifiable To me it seems a murder Having that thought there is only one thing to do One of us must not leave this place Gainor bowed but the sheriff gaped By the eternal he scoffed This sounds like one of them duels of the old days This was the way they used to talk Gentlemen said Gainor raising his long fingered hand it is my solemn duty to admonish you to make up your differences amicably Whatever that means sneered the sheriff But tell this young fool that s trying to act like he couldn t see me or hear me tell him that I don t carry no grudge ag in him that I m sorry he s Black Jack s son but that it s something he can live down maybe And I ll go so far as to say I m sorry that I done all that talking right to his face But farther than that I won t go And if all this is leading up to a gunplay by God gents the minute a gun comes into my hand I shoot to kill mark you that and don t you never forget it Mr Gainor had remained with his hand raised during this outbreak Now he turned to Terry You have heard he said I think the sheriff is going quite a way toward you Mr Colby Hollis gasped Terry Hollis is the name sir I beg your pardon said Gainor Mr Hollis it is Gentlemen I assure you that I feel for you both It seems however to be one of those unfortunate affairs when the mind must stop its debate and physical action must take up its proper place I lament the necessity but I admit it even though the law does not admit it But there are unwritten laws sirs unwritten laws which I for one consider among the holies of holies Palpably the old man was enjoying every minute of his own talk It was not his first affair of this nature He came out of an early and more courtly generation where men drank together in the evening by firelight and carved one another in the morning with glimmering bowie knives You are both he protested dear to me I esteem you both as men and as good citizens And I have done my best to open the way for peaceful negotiations toward an understanding It seems that I have failed Very well sirs Then it must be battle You are both armed With revolvers Nacher ly said the sheriff and spat accurately at a blaze on the tree trunk beside him He had grown very quiet I am armed said Terry calmly with a revolver Very good The hand of Gainor glided into his bosom and came forth bearing a white handkerchief His right hand slid into his coat and came forth likewise bearing a long revolver Gentlemen he said the first man to disobey my directions I shall shoot down unquestioningly like a dog I give you my solemn word for it And his eye informed them that he would enjoy the job He continued smoothly This contest shall accord with the only terms by which a duel with guns can be properly fought You will stand back to back with your guns not displayed but in your clothes At my word you will start walking in the opposite directions until my command Turn and at this command you will wheel draw your guns and fire until one man falls or both He sent his revolver through a peculiar twirling motion and
