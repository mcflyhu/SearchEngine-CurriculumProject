In Brook Street the rain fell It fell straight and disconsolate unutterably wet splashing drearily on the paved street between the rows of wet houses It fell all day from the dim dawn through the murky noon to the dark evening desolately weeping over a tired city Inside number fifty one Peggy mended clothes and sang a little song with Thomas in her lap and Peter sitting in the window seat knitted Thomas a sweater of Cambridge blue Peter was getting rather good at knitting Hilary was there too but not mending or knitting or singing he was coughing and complaining of the climate I fancy it is going to be influenza he observed at intervals shivering I feel extraordinarily weak and ache all up my back I fancy I have a high temperature only Peter has broken the thermometer You were a hundred and four I think Peter the day you went to bed I rather expect I am a hundred and five But I suppose I shall never know as it is impossible to afford another thermometer I feel certain it is influenza and in that case I must give up all hope of getting that job from Pickering as I cannot possibly go and see him to morrow Not but that it would be a detestable job anyhow but anything to keep our heads above water My headache is now like a hot metal band all round my head Peggy Poor old boy said Peggy Take some more phenacetine And do go to bed Hilary If you have got flu you ll only make yourself as bad as Peter did by staying up too long You ve neither of you any more sense than Tommy here nor so much by a long way have they little man No Kitty let him be you d only drop him on the floor if I let you and then he d break you know Silvio was kneeling up on the window seat by Peter s side taking an interest in the doings of the street Peggy said Well Larry what s the news of the great world It s raining said Silvio who had something of the mournful timbre of Hilary s voice in his Peggy said Oh darling be more interesting I m horribly afraid you re going to grow up obvious Larry and that will never do What else is it doing There s a cat in the rain said Silvio flattening his nose against the blurred glass and manifestly inclined to select the sadder aspects of the world s news for retail That tendency too perhaps he inherited from Hilary Presently he added There s a taxi coming up the street and Peggy placed Thomas on Peter s knees and came to the window to look When she had looked she said to Peter It must be nearly six o clock the clock gained seventeen minutes a day so that the time was always a matter for nicer calculation than Peggy could usually afford to give it and if Hilary s got flu I should think Tommy d be best out of the room I haven t easily the time to put him to bed this evening really Peter accepted the suggestion and conveyed his son from the room As he did so someone knocked at the front door and Peggy ran downstairs to open it She let in the unhappy noise of the rain and a tall slim person in a fur coat Peggy was surprised and most rarely a little embarrassed It wasn t the person she had looked for She even in her unwonted confusion let the visitor speak first He said Is Mr Peter Margerison in frostily giving her no sign of recognition He is not Lord Evelyn said Peggy hastily That is he is busy with the baby upstairs Will I take him a message I shall be glad if you will tell him I have called to see him I will Lord Evelyn Will you come up to the drawing room while I get him Peggy led the way drawing meanwhile on the resources of a picturesque imagination He may be a little while before he can leave the baby Lord Evelyn Poor mite it s starved with hunger the way it cries and cries and won t leave off and Peter has to cheer it Lord Evelyn grunted The steep stairs made him a little short of breath and not sympathetic And even went on Peggy stopping outside the drawing room door even when it does get a feed of milk it s to day from one kind of cow to morrow from another Why you d think all the cows in England turn and turn about supplied that poor child with milk and you know they get pains from changing It s not right poor baby but what can we and his father do The same with his scraps of clothes this weather he d a right to be having new warm ones but there he lies crying for the cold in his little thin out grown things it brings the tears to one s eyes to see him And he s not the only one either His father s just out of an illness and keeps a cough on the chest because he can t afford a warm waistcoat or the only cough mixture that cures him But Peter wouldn t like me to be telling you all this Will you go in there Lord Evelyn and wait She paused another moment her hand on the handle You ll not tell Peter I told you anything He d not be pleased He ll not breathe a word to you of it himself indeed he ll probably say it s not so Lord Evelyn made no comment he merely tapped his cane on the floor he seemed impatient to have the door opened And added Peggy if ever you chanced to be offering him anything I mean you might be for giving him a birthday present or a Xmas present or something sometime you d do best to put it as a gift to the baby or he ll never take it Having concluded her diplomacy she opened the door and ushered him into the room where Hilary sat with his headache and the children played noisily at horses Lord Evelyn Urquhart come to see Peter called Peggy into the room Come along out of that children and keep yourselves quiet somewhere She bundled them out and shut the door on Lord Evelyn and Hilary Hilary rose dizzily to his feet and bowed Lord Evelyn returned the courtesy distantly and stood by the door as far as possible from his host This is good of you said Hilary to come and see us in our fallen estate Do sit down Lord Evelyn putting his glass into his eye and turning it upon Hilary as if in astonishment at his impertinence in addressing him said curtly I came to see your half brother I had not the least intention nor the least desire to see anyone else whatever nor have I now Quite so said Hilary his teeth chattering with fever His temperature though he would never know as Peter had broken the thermometer must be anyhow a hundred and three he was sure Quite so But that doesn t affect my gratitude to you Peter s friends are mine I must thank you for remembering Peter Lord Evelyn presumably not seeing the necessity was silent We have not met Hilary went on passing his hot hand over his fevered brow where the headache ran all round like a hot metal band for a very long time Lord Evelyn if we put aside that momentary encounter at Astleys last year Hilary did put that aside rather hastily and went on Apart from that we have not met since we were both in Venice nearly two years ago Lord Evelyn I have often wished to tell you how very deeply I have regretted certain events that came between us there I think there is a great deal that I might explain to you Lord Evelyn with averted face said Be good enough to be silent sir I have no desire to hear any of your remarks I have come merely to see your half brother Of course said Hilary who was sensitive if you take that line there is nothing to be said between you and me Lord Evelyn acknowledged this admission with a slight inclination of the head Nothing whatever sir So there was silence till Peter came in pale and sickly and influenzaish but with a smile for Lord Evelyn It was extraordinarily nice of Lord Evelyn he thought to have come all the way to Brook Street in the rain to see him Lord Evelyn looked at him queerly intently out of his short sighted eyes as they shook hands I wish to talk to you he remarked with meaning Hilary took the hint looked proud said I see that my room is preferred to my company and went away When he had gone Peter said Do sit down but Lord Evelyn took no notice of that He had come to see Peter in his need but he had not forgiven him and he would remain standing in his house Peter had once hurt him so badly that the mere sight of him quickened his breath and flushed his cheek He tapped his cane impatiently against his grey spats You re ill he said accusingly Oh I ve only had flu said Peter I m all right now You re ill Lord Evelyn repeated Don t contradict me sir You re ill you re in want and you re bringing up a baby on insufficient diet What Not a bit said Peter I am not in want nor is Thomas Thomas diet is so sufficient that I m often afraid he ll burst with it Lord Evelyn said You re probably lying But if you re not why d ye countenance your sister in law s begging letters You re a hypocrite sir But that s nothing I didn t know before you may say Well you re right there Lord Evelyn s anger was working up He hadn t known it would be so difficult to talk to Peter and remain calm You want to make a fool of me again he broke out so you join in a lying letter and bring me here on false pretences At least I suppose it was really Lucy you thought to bring You play on Lucy s soft heart knowing you can squeeze money out of her and so you can afford to say you ve no use for mine Is that it Peter said dully looking at his anger as at an ancient play re staged I don t know what you re talking about I know nothing of any letter And you don t suppose I should take your money or Lucy s either Why should I I don t want money Lord Evelyn was pacing petulantly up and down the shabby carpet waving his cane as he walked Oh you know nothing of any letter don t you Well ask your sister in law then ask that precious brother of yours Haven t you always chosen to hang on to them and join in their dirty tricks And now you turn round and say you know nothing of their doings a pretty story Now look here Mr Peter Margerison you ve asked for money and you shall take it d ye see Peter flung at him in a queer and quite new hot bitterness and anger it was perhaps the result of influenza which has strange after effects You ve no right to come here and say these things to me I didn t want you to come I never asked you to and now I never want to see you again Please go Lord Evelyn Lord Evelyn paused in his walk and stood looking at him for a moment his lips parted to speak his hands clasped behind him over the gold head of his cane Then into the ensuing silence came Lucy small and pale and wet in her grey furs and stood like a startled kitten her wide eyes turning from one angry face to the other Peter said to her in a voice she had never heard from him before So you ve come too Lord Evelyn tittered disagreeably Didn t expect her of course did you So unlikely she d come after getting a letter like that I suppose you re wondering Lucy what I m doing dans cette gal re No said Lucy I wasn t I know You ve come to see Peter like me He laughed again Yes that s it Like you And now he pretends he won t take the money he asked for Lucy Won t be beholden to me at any price Perhaps he was waiting for you Lucy was looking at Peter who looked so ill and so strange and new Never before had he looked at her like that with hard eyes Peter was angry the skies had fallen She said and put out her hands to him What s the matter Peter Don t don t look like that Oh you re ill do sit down it s so stupid to stand about Peter said his own hands hanging at his sides Do you mind going away both of you I don t think I want to talk to either of you to day I suppose you ve brought money to give me too Lucy have you Lucy coloured faintly over her small pale face I won t give you anything you don t like Peter But I may give a present to Thomas mayn t I No said Peter without interest or emotion So they stood in silence for a moment facing each other Lucy full handed and impotent before Peter whose empty hands hung closed and unreceiving Lucy and Peter who had once been used to go shares and to give and take like two children and who could give and take no more and in the silence something oddly vibrated so that Lord Evelyn the onlooker abruptly moved and spoke Come home Lucy He s told us he ll have none of us Lucy still stood pleading like a child then at Lord Evelyn s touch on her arm she suddenly began to cry again like a child helpless and conquered At her tears Peter turned away sharply and walked to the window Please go he said Please go They went Lucy quietly crying and Lord Evelyn suddenly become oddly gentle comforting her At the door he paused for a moment looked round at Peter hesitated took a step back towards him began to say something Peter Then Peggy came in followed by Hilary Lord Evelyn shut his lips lightly bowed and followed Lucy downstairs Peggy went after them to let them out Hilary flung himself into a chair Well Peter Well Peter turned round from the window and Hilary started at his face My dear boy what on earth is the matter Then Peggy came in her eyes full of dismayed vexation but laughter twitching at her lips Oh my dears What a mood they re in Lord Evelyn looked at me to destroy me and Lucy crying as if she d never stop I tried to make her take some sal volatile but he wouldn t let her but wisked her into her carriage and shut the door in my face Mercy what temper The last words may not have had exclusive reference to Lord Evelyn as Peggy was now looking at Peter in some astonishment and alarm When Peter looked angry everyone was so surprised that they wanted to take his temperature and send him to bed Peggy would have liked to do that now but really didn t dare What had come to the child she wondered What did they talk about Peter A funny thing their coming within half an hour of each other like that wasn t it And I never thought to see Lord Evelyn here I must say Now I wonder why was Lucy crying and he so cross Peter left her to wonder that and said merely Once for all I won t have it You shall not beg for money and bring my name into it It s it s horrid With a weak childish word his anger seemed to explode and die away After all no anger of Peter s could last long And somehow illogically his anger here was more with the Urquharts than with the Margerisons and most with Lucy One is of course most angry with those who have most power to hurt Suddenly feeling rather ill Peter collapsed into a chair Peggy coming and kneeling by him half comforting half reproaching said Oh Peter darling you haven t been refusing money when you know you and Tommy and all of us need it so much Hilary said Peter has no regard whatever for what we all need He simply doesn t care I suppose now we shall never be able to afford even a new thermometer to replace the one Peter broke Again why should it matter to Peter He took his own temperature all through his illness and I suppose that is all he cares about I wonder how much fever I have at this moment Is my pulse very wild Peggy It is not said Peggy soothingly without feeling it And I daresay Peter s temperature is as high as yours now if we knew he looks like it Well Peter it was stupid of you my dear wasn t it to say no to a present and hurt their feelings that way when they d been so good as to come in the rain and all If they offer it again Peter said They won t They won t come here again ever They ve done with us I m glad to say and we with them So you needn t write to them again it will be no use Peter was certainly cross Peggy and Hilary looked at him in surprised disapproval How silly Where was the use of having friends if one treated them in this unkind proud way Peter said Hilary has obviously decided that we are not fit to have anything to do with his grand friends No doubt he is well advised he looked bitterly round the unkempt room and we will certainly take the hint Then Peter recovered himself and said Oh don t be an ass Hilary and laughed dejectedly and went up to finish putting Thomas to bed In the carriage that rolled through the rain from Brook Street to Park Lane Lord Evelyn Urquhart was saying This is the last time the very last time Never again do I try to help any Margerison First I had to listen for full five minutes to the lies of that woman then to the insufferable remarks of that cad that swindler Hilary Margerison who I firmly believe had an infectious disease which I have no doubt caught he was right he had caught it Then in comes Peter and insults me to my face and tells me to clear out of the house By all means I have done so and it will be for good What Lucy
