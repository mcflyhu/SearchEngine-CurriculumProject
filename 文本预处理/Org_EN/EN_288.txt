Isn t it great exclaimed Tavia shaking out her blue dress and tying a worn handkerchief over its particular closet hook so that no hump would appear in the soft blue texture I never would believe boarding school was such fun Here comes Rose Mary with more Nicks to introduce I hear her laughing hasn t she got the jolliest little giggle like our brook when it bubbles over I wish Tavia you would confine your wardrobe to your own half of the closet Dorothy remonstrated as she took down several articles that had crossed the line Oh I will dear only I was just listening to what those girls were saying I thought I heard Viola s voice Isn t it strange she does not call on us I told her our room was Number Nineteen I suppose she s busy every one appears to be except Rose Mary She doesn t seem to mind whether her trunk is unpacked first day or on Christmas said Dorothy working diligently at her own baggage I would just love to go the rounds with her declared Tavia if you did not insist upon going right to work I would rather have fun now and unpack later But there is no later We must go to bed at eight thirty my dear and we have no time to spare School will begin to morrow All the more reason why we should have the fun now persisted Tavia who was nevertheless getting her clothes on the hooks in short order There I m all hung up she declared banging the closet door furiously in spite of Dorothy s hat box trying to stop it But your hats Dorothy reminded her They have got to go on that shelf and there isn t an inch of room left Then I ll just stick the box under the bed calmly remarked the new girl making a kick at the unlucky box and following it up to the goal Against the rules announced Dorothy pointing to a typewritten notice on the door Read Haven t time You read them and tell me about them I ll take the box out if it says so but if we have to keep things in such angelic order why in the world don t they give us room Room Indeed this is a large room given us especially and it is quite a favor to be allowed to room together only real sisters ever get a double Heaven help the singles sighed Tavia in mock devotion But come on Doro we are missing all the fun I did think I heard the mob at our door Without further leave or license Tavia dragged Dorothy from her work and closed the door of Number Nineteen behind her In the hall they found Rose Mary whom the girls called Cologne Amy Brook Nita Brant and Lena Berg All were trying to talk at once each had the very most delicious vacation to tell about and to Dorothy it appeared the first requisite for boarding school ways was the coining of absurd and meaningless phrases Tavia fell right into line and could discount anyone of the crowd Splendifiorous glorioutious and scrambunctious were plainly hard to beat and no one seemed willing to try Cologne had a way of saying things in a jerky little jump that suggested bumping noses Amy Brook fairly strangled with dashes and other unexpected shorts stops while Nita Brant wallowed in such exclamations as Fine and dandy Perfectly sugary Too killingly dear for anything It was Cologne who declared Nita wallowed in slang because the Nicks had decided that no ready made slang should be used at meetings and Nita persisted in ignoring the rule Each new term brought the season s current phrases back in the custody of the sandy haired Nita and now on the first night her companions took precious good care to remind her of the transgression Altogether Dorothy found it difficult to keep track of anything like conversation and was forced to say yes and no on suspicion Tavia had better luck Edna Black christened Ebony Ned took her in charge at once and the two Ned had already established her reputation as a black sheep dashed off down the corridor bursting in on unsuspecting Babes newcomers and managing somehow or other to upset half emptied trunk trays and do damage generally Hello Hello came a shout from the first turn or senior row Come somebody and fan me That s Dick Ned told Tavia Molly Richards but we call her Dick By the way what shall we call you What is your full name The very whole of it Octavia Travers Birthday is within the octave of Christmas declared the Dalton girl impressively Oct or Ouch That sounds too much like Auch du lieber Augustine or like a cut finger studied Edna Better take yours from Christmas Chrissy sounds cute Yes especially since I have lately had my hair cut Christy after our friend Columbus agreed Tavia tossing back her new set of tangles I was in a railroad accident you know and lost my long hair I had the time of my life getting it cut off properly in a real barber shop Dorothy s cousins two of the nicest boys were with us Dorothy went too It was such fun All right it shall be Chrissy then decided Edna It s funny we always turn a girl s name into a boy s name when we can Let s go and see Dick and at this she dragged Tavia out of the corner of the hall where they had taken refuge from a girl who was threatening them for upsetting all her ribbons and laces Oh there you are Ned Ebony greeted Molly as the two bolted into her room Where s everybody I haven t seen Fiddle yet Viola Green asked Tavia Funny I should have thought of that name for her You knew she plays the fiddle adorably No but I knew she had been named after her grandfather s violin What a queer notion Queer girl too remarked Molly but a power in her way Did she come up yet On our train said Tavia too prudent for once in her life to tell the whole story She is going to cut the Nicks announced Edna She told me so first thing Then she slammed her door and no one has caught a glimpse of her since Tavia was fairly bursting with news at this point but she had promised Dorothy not to interfere with Viola in any way and she wisely decided not to start in on such dangerous territory as Viola s visit to Dalton So the matter was dropped and the girls went forth for more fun Dorothy had met Miss Higley Mrs Pangborn s assistant She proved to be a little woman with glasses the stems going all the way back of her ears She seemed snappy Dorothy thought and gave all sorts of orders to the girls while pretending to become acquainted with Dorothy The crankiest crank declared one girl when the little woman had gone further down the hall with her objections But really we need a chief of police Don t you think so Isn t Mrs Pangborn chief asked Dorothy Oh she s president of the board of commissioners replied Rose Mary Miss Honorah Higley is the chief of all departments And Miss Crane inquired Dorothy I have met her Oh she s all right declared the informer Camille Crane is a dear if the girls do call her Feathers I thought all that nick name business was done in colleges remarked Dorothy Every one here seems to have two names Couldn t possibly get along without them declared Cologne I ve been Cologne since my first day what have they given you I haven t heard yet said Dorothy smiling But I do hope they won t Dot me I hate dots Then make it Dashes or Specks but you must not be Specks We have one already Glad of it returned Dorothy I don t like Specks either I guess we will make it D D That s good and means a whole lot of things There declared Cologne I ve had the honor of being your sponsor Now you must always stick by me D D you are to be hereafter That will tickle Tavia
