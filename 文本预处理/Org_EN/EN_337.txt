Eve Carfax was painting an easel picture of the walled garden when Lynette arrived with a camp stool a drawing book a box of paints and a little green watering pot full of water I want to make pictures You ll teach me won t you Miss Eve I ll try to I ve got a lovely box of paints What a nice music stand you ve got Some people call it an easel I ought to have one oughtn t I I ll ask Mr Beeby to make one Mr Beeby s the carpenter He s such a funny man with a round the corner eye Eve took the apprenticeship as seriously as it was offered and started Lynette on a group of blue delphiniums white lilies and scarlet poppies Lynette began with fine audacity and red white and blue splodges sprang up all over the sheet But they refused to take on any suggestion of detail and the more Lynette strove with them the smudgier they became Oh Miss Eve How are you getting on I m not getting on The colours seem to have got on your fingers They re all sticky I oughtn t to lick them ought I No Try a rag I ll go and wash in the gold fish basin The gold fish won t mind She ran off into the Japanese garden reappeared borrowed one of Eve s clean rags and stood watching the expert s brush laying on colours You do do it beautifully Well you see I have done it for years Lynette meditated I shall be awful old then before I can paint daddy a picture Can you draw fairies and animals Supposing I try Yes do Draw some in my book The easel picture was covered up and abandoned for the time being The two stools were placed side by side and the two heads the auburn and the black came very close together I ll draw Mr Puck Yes Mr Puck Mr Puck is all round round head round eyes round mouth What a funny little round tummy you have given him You see he s rather greedy Now we ll draw Mr Bruin Daddy made such funny rhymes about Mr Bruin Give him a top hat Isn t that sweet But what s he doing sucking his fingers He has been stealing honey and he s licking his paws Now now draw something out of the Bible The Bible Yes Draw God making Eve That would take rather a long time Well draw the Serpent Devil and God in the garden I ll draw the serpent What a lovely Snake Devil Now if I d been God I d have got a big stick and hit the Snake Devil on the head Wouldn t it have saved lots and lots of trouble It would Then why didn t God do it Eve was rescued by Canterton from justifying such theological incongruities He found them with their heads together auburn and black bent over Lynette s drawing book He stood for a moment or two watching them and listening to their intimate prattle This girl who loved the colour and the mystery of life as he loved them could be as a child with Lynette You seem very busy Lynette jumped up Daddy come and look Isn t Miss Eve clever For some reason Eve blushed and did not turn to look at Canterton Here s Mr Puck and old Bruin and Titania and Orson and the Devil Serpent Miss Eve is just splendid at devils Is she That s rather a reflection He stood behind Eve and looked down over her shoulder You have given the serpent a woman s head She turned her chin but not her eyes Yes Symbolism I may have been thinking of something you said the other day A full throated and good humoured voice was heard calling Lynette Lynette Oh there s Miss Vance It s the music lesson I ll show her the Serpent Devil I ll come back Miss Eve presently Yes come back little Beech Leaf They were silent for a few moments after she had gone I like that name Little Beech Leaf Just the colour in autumn and racing about in the wind He came and stood in front of Eve You seem to be getting on famously you two Her eyes lifted to his She s delightful No self consciousness no showing off and such vitality And that hair and those elf s eyes of hers thrill one And she likes you too not a little Eve coloured Well if she does it s like a bit of real life flying in through the narrow window of little worries and calling one out to play Little worries I don t want to talk about them the importunities of the larder and the holes in the house linen and the weekly bills I am always trying to teach myself to laugh And it is very good for one to be among flowers He glanced at the easel You have covered up the picture May I see it It is not quite finished In twenty minutes May I come back in twenty minutes Oh yes I like my own flowers to be just at their best when friends are to see them Yes you understand Canterton left her and spent half an hour walking the winding paths of the Japanese garden crossing miniature waterways and gazing into little pools There were dwarf trees dwarf hedges and a little wooden temple half smothered with roses in which sat a solemn black marble Buddha This Buddha had caused a mystery and a scandal in the neighbourhood for it had been whispered that Canterton was a Buddhist and that he had been found on his knees in this little wooden temple In the pools crimson white and yellow lilies basked The rocks were splashed with colour Clumps of Japanese iris spread out their flat tops of purple and white and rose Fish swam in the pools with a vague glimmer of silver and gold At the end of half an hour Canterton returned to the walled garden and found Eve sitting before the picture her hands lying in her lap The poise of her head reminded him of Beata Beatrix but her face had far more colour more passionate aliveness and there was the sex mystery upon her mouth and in the blackness of her hair Ready She turned to him and smiled Yes you may look He stood gazing at her work in silence yet with a profound delight welling up into his eyes She watched his face sensitively hardly conscious of the fact that she wanted to please him more than anyone else in the world Exquisite By George you have eyes She laughed softly in a happy exultant throat I surprised myself I think it must be Lynette s magic and the fairies in the Wilderness If you are going to paint like that you ought to do big things Oh I don t know There are not many people who really care That s true He gazed again at the picture and then his eyes suddenly sought hers Yes you can see things you can feel the colour Sometimes it is so vivid that it almost hurts They continued to look into each other s eyes questioningly wonderingly with something akin to self realisation It was as though they had discovered each other and were re discovering each other every time they met and talked Lynette reappeared where the long walk ended in a little courtyard paved with red bricks and surrounded by square cut box hedges She had finished her half hour s music lesson with Miss Vance and was out again like a bird on the wing Canterton had insisted on limiting her lessons to three hours a day though his ideas on a child s upbringing had clashed with those of his wife There had been a vast deal of talking on Gertrude s part and a few laconic answers on the part of her husband Now and again when the issue was serious Canterton quietly persisted in having his own way He never interfered with her multifarious schemes Gertrude could fuss here there and everywhere provided she did not tamper with Lynette s childhood or thrust her activities into the serious life of the great gardens of Fernhill Let s go and have tea in the Wilderness Why not You ll come Miss Eve She snuggled up to Eve and an arm went round her I m afraid I can t dear to day Why can t you I must go home and take care of my mother Lynette seemed to regard this as a very quaint excuse How funny Fancy anyone wanting to take care of my mother Why she s always wanting to take care of everybody else cept me I wonder if they like it I shouldn t Your mother is very kind to everybody dear Is she Then why don t Sarah and Ann and Edith and Johnson like her I know they don t for I ve heard them talking They all love you daddy Canterton looked at her gravely You mustn t listen to what everybody says And never tell tales of everybody Come along old lady we ll go down to the Wilderness I wish you d come Miss Eve I wish I could but I mustn t to day I do like you so much really I do Eve drew Lynette close and kissed her with impulsive tenderness And Canterton
