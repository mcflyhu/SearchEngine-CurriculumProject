A grave white haired seneschal came to their table and inquired courteously whether Gerard Eliassoen was of their company Upon Gerard s answer he said The Princess Marie would confer with you young sir I am to conduct you to her presence Instantly all faces within hearing turned sharp round and were bent with curiosity and envy on the man that was to go to a princess Gerard rose to obey I wager we shall not see you again said Margaret calmly but colouring a little That you will was the reply then he whispered in her ear This is my good princess but you are my queen He added aloud Wait for me I pray you I will presently return Ay ay said Peter awaking and speaking at one and the same moment Gerard gone the pair whose dress was so homely yet they were with the man whom the Princess sent for became the cynosure of neighbouring eyes observing which William Johnson came forward acted surprise and claimed his relations And to think that there was I at your backs and you saw me not Nay cousin Johnson I saw you long syne said Margaret coldly You saw me and spoke not to me Cousin it was for you to welcome us to Rotterdam as it is for us to welcome you at Sevenbergen Your servant denied us a seat in your house The idiot And I had a mind to see whether it was like maid like master for there is sooth in bywords William Johnson blushed purple He saw Margaret was keen and suspected him He did the wisest thing under the circumstances trusted to deeds not words He insisted on their coming home with him at once and he would show them whether they were welcome to Rotterdam or not Who doubts it cousin Who doubts it said the scholar Margaret thanked him graciously but demurred to go just now said she wanted to hear the minstrels again In about a quarter of an hour Johnson renewed his proposal and bade her observe that many of the guests had left Then her real reason came out It were ill manners to our friend and he will lose us He knows not where we lodge in Rotterdam and the city is large and we have parted company once already Oh said Johnson we will provide for that My young man ahem I mean my secretary shall sit here and wait and bring him on to my house he shall lodge with me and with no other Cousin we shall be too burdensome Nay nay you shall see whether you are welcome or not you and your friends and your friends friends if need be and I shall hear what the Princess would with him Margaret felt a thrill of joy that Gerard should be lodged under the same roof with her then she had a slight misgiving But if your young man should be thoughtless and go play and Gerard miss him He go play He leave that spot where I put him and bid him stay Ho stand forth Hans Cloterman A figure clad in black serge and dark violet hose arose and took two steps and stood before them without moving a muscle a solemn precise young man the very statue of gravity and starched propriety At his aspect Margaret being very happy could hardly keep her countenance But she whispered Johnson I would put my hand in the fire for him We are at your command cousin as soon as you have given him his orders Hans was then instructed to sit at the table and wait for Gerard and conduct him to Ooster Waagen Straet He replied not in words but by calmly taking the seat indicated and Margaret Peter and William Johnson went away together And indeed it is time you were abed father after all your travel said Margaret This had been in her mind all along Hans Cloterman sat waiting for Gerard solemn and businesslike The minutes flew by but excited no impatience in that perfect young man Johnson did him no more than justice when he laughed to scorn the idea of his secretary leaving his post or neglecting his duty in pursuit of sport or out of youthful hilarity and frivolity As Gerard was long in coming the patient Hans his employer s eye being no longer on him improved the time by quaffing solemnly silently and at short but accurately measured intervals goblets of Corsican wine The wine was strong so was Cloterman s head and Gerard had been gone a good hour ere the model secretary imbibed the notion that Creation expected Cloterman to drink the health of all good fellows and nommement of the Duke of Burgundy there present With this view he filled bumper nine and rose gingerly but solemnly and slowly Having reached his full height he instantly rolled upon the grass goblet in hand spilling the cold liquor on more than one ankle whose owners frisked but not disturbing a muscle in his own long face which in the total eclipse of reason retained its gravity primness and infallibility The seneschal led Gerard through several passages to the door of the pavilion where some young noblemen embroidered and feathered sat sentinel guarding the heir apparent and playing cards by the red light of torches their servants held A whisper from the seneschal and one of them rose reluctantly stared at Gerard with haughty surprise and entered the pavilion He presently returned and beckoning the pair led then through a passage or two and landed them in an ante chamber where sat three more young gentlemen feathered furred and embroidered like pieces of fancy work and deep in that instructive and edifying branch of learning dice You can t see the Princess it is too late said one Another followed suit She passed this way but now with her nurse She is gone to bed doll and all Deuce ace again Gerard prepared to retire The seneschal with an incredulous smile replied The young man is here by the Countess s orders be so good as conduct him to her ladies On this a superb Adonis rose with an injured look and led Gerard into a room where sat or lolloped eleven ladies chattering like magpies Two more industrious than the rest were playing cat s cradle with fingers as nimble as their tongues At the sight of a stranger all the tongues stopped like one piece of complicated machinery and all the eyes turned on Gerard as if the same string that checked the tongues had turned the eyes on Gerard was ill at ease before but this battery of eyes discountenanced him and down went his eyes on the ground Then the cowards finding like the hare who ran by the pond and the frogs scuttled into the water that there was a creature they could frighten giggled and enjoyed their prowess Then a duenna said severely Mesdames and they were all abashed at once as though a modesty string had been pulled This same duenna took Gerard and marched before him in solemn silence The young man s heart sank and he had half a mind to turn and run out of the place What must princes be he thought when their courtiers are so freezing Doubtless they take their breeding from him they serve These reflections were interrupted by the duenna suddenly introducing him into a room where three ladies sat working and a pretty little girl tuning a lute The ladies were richly but not showily dressed and the duenna went up to the one who was hemming a kerchief and said a few words in a low tone This lady then turned towards Gerard with a smile and beckoned him to come near her She did not rise but she laid aside her work and her manner of turning towards him slight as the movement was was full of grace and ease and courtesy She began a conversation at once Margaret Van Eyck is an old friend of mine sir and I am right glad to have a letter from her hand and thankful to you sir for bringing it to me safely Marie my love this is the gentleman who brought you that pretty miniature Sir I thank you a thousand times said the young lady I am glad you feel her debtor sweetheart for our friend would have us to do him a little service in return I will do anything on earth for him replied the young lady with ardour Anything on earth is nothing in the world said the Countess of Charolois quietly Well then I will What would you have me to do sir Gerard had just found out what high society he was in My sovereign demoiselle said he gently and a little tremulously where there have been no pains there needs no reward But we must obey mamma All the world must obey That is true Then our demoiselle reward me if you will by letting me hear the stave you were going to sing and I did interrupt it What you love music sir I adore it The little princess looked inquiringly at her mother and received a smile of assent She then took her lute and sang a romaunt of the day Although but twelve years old she was a well taught and painstaking musician Her little claw swept the chords with Courage and precision and struck out the notes of the arpeggio clear and distinct and bright like twinkling stars but the main charm was her voice It was not mighty but it was round clear full and ringing like a bell She sang with a certain modest eloquence though she knew none of the tricks of feeling She was too young to be theatrical or even sentimental so nothing was forced all gushed Her little mouth seemed the mouth of Nature The ditty too was as pure as its utterance As there were none of those false divisions those whining slurs which are now sold so dear by Italian songsters though every jackal in India delivers them gratis to his customers all night and sometimes gets shot for them and always deserves it so there were no cadences and fiorituri the trite turgid and feeble expletives of song the skim milk with which mindless musicians and mindless writers quench fire wash out colour and drown melody and meaning dead While the pure and tender strain was flowing from the pure young throat Gerard s eyes filled The Countess watched him with interest for it was usual to applaud the Princess loudly but not with cheek and eye So when the voice ceased and the glasses left off ringing she asked demurely Was he content Gerard gave a little start the spoken voice broke a charm and brought him back to earth Oh madam he cried surely it is thus that cherubs and seraphs sing and charm the saints in heaven I am somewhat of your opinion my young friend said the Countess with emotion and she bent a look of love and gentle pride upon her girl a heavenly look such as they say is given to the eye of the short lived resting on the short lived The Countess resumed My old friend request me to be serviceable to you It is the first favour she has done us the honour of asking us and the request is sacred You are in holy orders sir Gerard bowed I fear you are not a priest you look too young Oh no madam I am not even a sub deacon I am only a lector but next month I shall be an exorcist and before long an acolyth Well Monsieur Gerard with your accomplishments you can soon pass through the inferior orders And let me beg you to do so For the day after you have said your first mass I shall have the pleasure of appointing you to a benefice Oh madam And Marie remember I make this promise in your name as well as my own Fear not mamma I will not forget But if he will take my advice what he will be is Bishop of Liege The Bishop of Liege is a beautiful bishop What do you not remember him mamma that day we were at Liege he was braver than grandpapa himself He had on a crown a high one and it was cut in the middle and it was full of oh such beautiful jewels and his gown stiff with gold and his mantle too and it had a broad border all pictures but above all his gloves you have no such gloves mamma They were embroidered and covered with jewels and scented with such lovely scent I smelt them all the time he was giving me his blessing on my head with them Dear old man I dare say he will die soon most old people do and then sir you Can be bishop you know and wear Gently Marie gently bishoprics are for old gentlemen and this is a young gentleman Mamma he is not so very young Not compared with you Marie eh He is a good birth dear mamma and I am sure he is good enough for a bishop Alas mademoiselle you are mistaken I know not that Monsieur Gerard but I am a little puzzled to know on what grounds mademoiselle there pronounces your character so boldly Alas mamma said the Princess you have not looked at his face then and she raised her eyebrows at her mother s simplicity I beg your pardon said the Countess I have Well sir if I cannot go quite so fast as my daughter attribute it to my age not to a want of interest in your welfare A benefice will do to begin your Career with and I must take care it is not too far from what call you the place Tergou madam A priest gives up much continued the Countess often I fear he learns too late how much and her woman s eye rested a moment on Gerard with mild pity and half surprise at his resigning her sex and all the heaven they can bestow and the great parental joys at least you shall be near your friends Have you a mother Yes madam thanks be to God Good You shall have a church near Tergou She will thank me And now sir we must not detain you too long from those who have a better claim on your society than we have Duchess oblige me by bidding one of the pages conduct him to the hall of banquet the way is hard to find Gerard bowed low to the Countess and the Princess and backed towards the door I hope it will be a nice benefice said the Princess to him with a pretty smile as he was going out then shaking her head with an air of solemn misgiving but you had better have been Bishop of Liege Gerard followed his new conductor his heart warm with gratitude but ere he reached the banquet hall a chill came over him The mind of one who has led a quiet uneventful life is not apt to take in contradictory feelings at the same moment and balance them but rather to be overpowered by each in turn While Gerard was with the Countess the excitement of so new a situation the unlooked for promise the joy and pride it would cause at home possessed him wholly but now it was passion s turn to be heard again What give up Margaret whose soft hand he still felt in his and her deep eyes in his heart resign her and all the world of love and joy she had opened on him to day The revulsion when it did come was so strong that he hastily resolved to say nothing at home about the offered benefice The Countess is so good thought he she has a hundred ways of aiding a young man s fortune she will not compel me to be a priest when she shall learn I love one of her sex one would almost think she does know it for she cast a strange look on me and said A priest gives up much too much I dare say she will give me a place about the palace And with this hopeful reflection his mind was eased and being now at the entrance of the banqueting hall he thanked his conductor and ran hastily with joyful eyes to Margaret He came in sight of the table she was gone Peter was gone too Nobody was at the table at all only a citizen in sober garments had just tumbled under it dead drunk and several persons were raising him to carry him away Gerard never guessed how important this solemn drunkard was to him he was looking for Beauty and let the Beast lie He ran wildly round the hall which was now comparatively empty She was not there He left the palace outside he found a crowd gaping at two great fan lights just lighted over the gate He asked them earnestly if they had seen an old man in a gown and a lovely girl pass out They laughed at the question They were staring at these new lights that turn night into day They didn t trouble their heads about old men and young wenches every day sights From another group he learned there was a Mystery being played under canvas hard by and all the world gone to see it This revived his hopes and he went and saw the Mystery In this representation divine personages too sacred for me to name here came clumsily down from heaven to talk sophistry with the cardinal Virtues the nine Muses and the seven deadly sins all present in human shape and not unlike one another To enliven which weary stuff in rattled the Prince of the power of the air and an imp that kept molesting him and buffeting him with a bladder at each thwack of which the crowd were in ecstasies When the Vices had uttered good store of obscenity and the Virtues twaddle the celestials including the nine Muses went gingerly back to heaven one by one for there was but one cloud and two artisans worked it up with its supernatural freight and worked it down with a winch in full sight of the audience These disposed of the bottomless pit opened and flamed in the centre of the stage the carpenters and Virtues shoved the Vices in and the Virtues and Beelzebub and his tormentor danced merrily round the place of eternal torture to the fife and tabor This entertainment was writ by the Bishop of Ghent for the diffusion of religious sentiment by the aid of the senses and was an average specimen of theatrical exhibitions so long as they were in the hands of the clergy But in course of time the laity conducted plays and so the theatre I learn from the pulpit has become profane Margaret was nowhere in the crowd and Gerard could not enjoy the performance he actually went away in Act in the midst of a much admired piece of dialogue in which Justice out quibbled Satan He walked through many streets but could not find her he sought At last fairly worn out he went to a hostelry and slept till daybreak All that day heavy and heartsick he sought her but could never fall in with her or her father nor ever obtain the slightest clue Then he felt she was false or had changed her mind He was irritated now as well as sad More good fortune fell on him he almost hated it At last on the third day after he had once more been through every street he said She is not in the town and I shall never see her again I will go home He started for Tergou with royal favour promised with fifteen golden angels in his purse a golden medal on his bosom and a heart like a lump of
