At Davids Island the four happiest years of my army life glided swiftly away There was a small steam tug which made regular and frequent trips over to New Rochelle and we enjoyed our intercourse with the artists and players who lived there Zogbaum whose well known pictures of sailors and warships and soldiers had reached us even in the far West and whose charming family added so much to our pleasure Julian Hawthorne with his daughter Hildegarde now so well known as a literary critic Henry Loomis Nelson whose fair daughter Margaret came to our little dances and promptly fell in love with a young slim straight Artillery officer A case of love at first sight followed by a short courtship and a beautiful little country wedding at Miss Nelson s home on the old Pelham Road where Hildegarde Hawthorne was bridesmaid in a white dress and scarlet flowers the artillery colors and many famous literary people from everywhere were present Augustus Thomas the brilliant playwright whose home was near the Remingtons on Lathers Hill and whose wife so young so beautiful and so accomplished made that home attractive and charming Francis Wilson known to the world at large first as a singer in comic opera and now as an actor and author also lived in New Rochelle and we came to have the honor of being numbered amongst his friends A devoted husband and kind father a man of letters and a book lover such is the man as we knew him in his home and with his family And now came the delicious warm summer days We persuaded the Quartermaster to prop up the little row of old bathing houses which had toppled over with the heavy winter gales There were several bathing enthusiasts amongst us we had a pretty fair little stretch of beach which was set apart for the officers families and now what bathing parties we had Kemble the illustrator joined our ranks and on a warm summer morning the little old Tug Hamilton was gay with the artists and their families the players and writers of plays and soon you could see the little garrison hastening to the beach and the swimmers running down the long pier down the run way and off head first into the clear waters of the Sound What a company was that The younger and the older ones all together children and their fathers and mothers all happy all well all so gay and we of the frontier so enamored of civilization and what it brought us There were no intruders and ah those were happy days Uncle Sam seemed to be making up to us for what we had lost during all those long years in the wild places Then Augustus Thomas wrote the play of Arizona and we went to New York to see it put on and we sat in Mr Thomas box and saw our frontier life brought before us with startling reality And so one season followed another Each bringing its pleasures and then came another lovely wedding for my brother Harry gave up his bachelor estate and married one of the nicest and handsomest girls in Westchester County and their home in New Rochelle was most attractive My son was at the Stevens Institute and both he and Katharine were able to spend their vacations at David s Island and altogether our life there was near to perfection We were doomed to have one more tour in the West however and this time it was the Middle West For in the autumn of Jack was ordered to Jefferson Barracks Missouri on construction work Jefferson Barracks is an old and historic post on the Mississippi River some ten miles south of St Louis I could not seem to take any interest in the post or in the life there I could not form new ties so quickly after our life on the coast and I did not like the Mississippi Valley and St Louis was too far from the post and the trolley ride over there too disagreeable for words After seven months of just existing on my part at Jefferson Barracks Jack received an order for Fort Myer the end the aim the dream of all army people Fort Myer is about three miles from Washington D C We lost no time in getting there and were soon settled in our pleasant quarters There was some building to be done but the duty was comparatively light and we entered with considerable zest into the social life of the Capital We expected to remain there for two years at the end of which time Captain Summerhayes would be retired and Washington would be our permanent home But alas our anticipation was never to be realized for as we all know in May of the Spanish War broke out and my husband was ordered to New York City to take charge of the Army Transport Service under Colonel Kimball No delay was permitted to him so I was left behind to pack up the household goods and to dispose of our horses and carriages as best I could The battle of Manila Bay had changed the current of our lives and we were once more adrift The young Cavalry officers came in to say good bye to Captain Jack every one was busy packing up his belongings for an indefinite period and preparing for the field We all felt the undercurrent of sadness and uncertainty but a good health and happy return was drunk all around and Jack departed at midnight for his new station and new duties The next morning at daybreak we were awakened by the tramp tramp of the Cavalry marching out of the post en route for Cuba We peered out of the windows and watched the troops we loved so well until every man and horse had vanished from our sight Fort Myer was deserted and our hearts were sad My sister Harriet who was visiting us at that time returned from her morning walk and as she stepped upon the porch she said Well of all lonesome places I ever saw this is the worst yet I am going to pack my trunk and leave I came to visit an army post but not an old women s home or an orphan asylum that is about all this place is now I simply cannot stay Whereupon she proceeded immediately to carry out her resolution and I was left behind with my young daughter to finish and close up our life at Fort Myer To describe the year which followed that strenuous year in New York is beyond my power That summer gave Jack his promotion to a Major but the anxiety and the terrible strain of official work broke down his health entirely and in the following winter the doctors sent him to Florida to recuperate After six weeks in St Augustine we returned to New York The stress of the war was over the Major was ordered to Governor s Island as Chief Quartermaster Department of the East and in the following year he was retired by operation of the law at the age limit I was glad to rest from the incessant changing of stations the life had become irksome to me in its perpetual unrest I was glad to find a place to lay my head and to feel that we were not under orders to find and to keep a roof tree under which we could abide forever In by an act of Congress the veterans of the Civil War who had served continuously for thirty years or more were given an extra grade so now my hero wears with complacency the silver leaf of the Lieutenant Colonel and is enjoying the quiet life of a civilian But that fatal spirit of unrest from which I thought to escape and which ruled my life for so many years sometimes asserts its power and at those times my thoughts turn back to the days when we were all Lieutenants together marching across the deserts and mountains of Arizona back to my friends of the Eighth Infantry that historic regiment whose officers and men fought before the walls of Chapultepec and Mexico back to my friends of the Sixth Cavalry to the days at Camp MacDowell where we slept under the stars and watched the sun rise from behind the Four Peaks of the MacDowell Mountains where we rode the big cavalry horses over the sands of the Maricopa desert swung in our hammocks under the ramadas swam in the red waters of the Verde River ate canned peaches pink butter and commissary hams listened for the scratching of the centipedes as they scampered around the edges of our canvas covered floors found scorpions in our slippers and rattlesnakes under our beds The old post is long since abandoned but the Four Peaks still stand wrapped in their black shadows by night and their purple colors by day waiting for the passing of the Apache and the coming of the white man who shall dig his canals in those arid plains and build his cities upon the ruins of the ancient Aztec dwellings The Sixth Cavalry as well as the Eighth Infantry has seen many vicissitudes since those days Some of our gallant Captains and Lieutenants have won their stars others have been slain in battle Dear gentle Major Worth received wounds in the Cuban campaign which caused his death but he wore his stars before he obeyed the last call The gay young officers of Angel Island days hold dignified commands in the Philippines Cuba and Alaska My early experiences were unusually rough None of us seek such experiences but possibly they bring with them a sort of recompense in that simple comforts afterwards seem by contrast to be the greatest luxuries I am glad to have known the army the soldiers the line and the Staff it is good to think of honor and chivalry obedience to duty and the pride of arms to have lived amongst men whose motives were unselfish and whose aims were high amongst men who served an ideal who stood ready at the call of their country to give their lives for a Government which is to them the best in the world Sometimes I hear the still voices of the Desert they seem to be calling me through the echoes of the Past I hear in fancy the wheels of the ambulance crunching the small broken stones of the malapais or grating swiftly over the gravel of the smooth white roads of the river bottoms I hear the rattle of the ivory rings on the harness of the six mule team I see the soldiers marching on ahead I see my white tent so inviting after a long day s journey But how vain these fancies Railroad and automobile have annihilated distance the army life of those years is past and gone and Arizona as we knew it has vanished from the face of the earth
