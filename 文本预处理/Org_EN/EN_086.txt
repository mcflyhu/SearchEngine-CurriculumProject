During the summer Henrietta Hen roamed about the farmyard as she pleased To be sure she always came a running at feeding time But except when there was something there to eat she didn t go near the henhouse She stole her nest to use Johnnie Green s words now in one place and now in another And at night she roosted on any handy place in the barn or the haymow under the carriage shed or even over the pigpens However when the nights began to grow chilly Henrietta was glad enough to creep into the henhouse with her companions She always retired early And being a good sleeper she slept usually until the Rooster began to crow towards dawn Of course now and then some fidgetty hen fancied that she heard a fox prowling about and waked everybody else with her squalls Such interruptions upset Henrietta After the flock had gone to sleep again Henrietta Hen was more than likely to dream that Fatty Coon was in the henhouse And she would squawk right out and start another commotion Luckily such disturbances didn t happen every night Often nothing occurred to break the silence of the henhouse And Henrietta would dream only of pleasant things such as cracked corn or crisp cabbage leaves or bone meal After dreams of that sort Henrietta couldn t always be sure when the Rooster waked her with his crowing that she hadn t already breakfasted But she would peck at her breakfast when feeding time came and if it tasted good she would know then that the other food had been nothing but a dream One night soon after she had gone back to roost in the henhouse it seemed to Henrietta that she had scarcely fallen asleep when the Rooster crowed She awoke with a start Goodness she exclaimed under her breath I must have slept soundly for I haven t dreamed a single dream all night long Then she noticed that none of the other hens had stirred Lazy bones Henrietta remarked to the Rooster You won t get em up in a hurry They don t hear you at all To her surprise she received no answer He couldn t have heard me she said to herself So she repeated her speech in a louder tone And still the Rooster made no reply Henrietta couldn t understand it he was always so polite to the ladies Could it be that he was snubbing her Henrietta grew a bit angry as that thought popped into her head What s the matter she snapped Have you lost your voice It was loud enough to wake me up a few moments ago Receiving no response whatsoever Henrietta completely lost her temper I ll see what s wrong with you she cackled And throwing herself off her roost though it was dark as a pocket in the henhouse she flung herself upon the perch just opposite where she knew the Rooster had slept It was no wonder that Henrietta Hen blundered in the dark It was no wonder that she missed her way and stumbled squarely into the Rooster knocking him headlong on the floor He set up a terrible clamor And he made Henrietta Hen angrier than ever for he cried out in a loud voice something that would have displeased anybody A skunk is after me he bawled chilly adj I feel chilly without a coat I grew chilly when the fire went out retired adj The old man retired to the country for rest Many retired people take up gardening as a hobby sleeper n I usually go up to London on the sleeper But first he explained that he was a very heavy sleeper commotion n They made a commotion by yelling at each other in the theatre Suddenly the whole street was in commotion disturbances n disturbance The government has set up a commission of inquiry into the disturbances at the prison Extra police were called in to quell the disturbances whatsoever adv pron There s no reason whatsoever to turn down this suggestion All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them perch n v The bird took its perch Little birds perch themselves on the branches displeased a The old man was displeased and darted an angry look at me He was displeased about the whole affair skunk n v That was a rotten thing to do you skunk The skunk gives off an unpleasant smell when attacked bawled v bawl She bawled at him in front of everyone My boss bawled me out for being late
