I have yet said little of the Highlanders They were all three of the followers of James More which bound the accusation very tight about their master s neck All understood a word or two of English but Neil was the only one who judged he had enough of it for general converse in which when once he got embarked his company was often tempted to the contrary opinion They were tractable simple creatures showed much more courtesy than might have been expected from their raggedness and their uncouth appearance and fell spontaneously to be like three servants for Andie and myself Dwelling in that isolated place in the old falling ruins of a prison and among endless strange sounds of the sea and the sea birds I thought I perceived in them early the effects of superstitious fear When there was nothing doing they would either lie and sleep for which their appetite appeared insatiable or Neil would entertain the others with stories which seemed always of a terrifying strain If neither of these delights were within reach if perhaps two were [pg ]sleeping and the third could find no means to follow their example I would see him sit and listen and look about him in a progression of uneasiness starting his face blenching his hands clutched a man strung like a bow The nature of these fears I had never an occasion to find out but the sight of them was catching and the nature of the place that we were in favourable to alarms I can find no word for it in the English but Andie had an expression for it in the Scots from which he never varied Ay he would say it s an unco place the Bass It is so I always think of it It was an unco place by night unco by day and these were unco sounds of the calling of the solans and the plash of the sea and the rock echoes that hung continually in our ears It was chiefly so in moderate weather When the waves were anyway great they roared about the rock like thunder and the drums of armies dreadful but merry to hear and it was in the calm days that a man could daunt himself with listening not a Highlandman only as I several times experimented on myself so many still hollow noises haunted and reverberated in the porches of the rock This brings me to a story I heard and a scene I took part in which quite changed our terms of living and had a great effect on my departure It chanced one night I fell in a muse beside the fire and that little air of Alan s coming back to my memory began [pg ]to whistle A hand was laid upon my arm and the voice of Neil bade me to stop for it was not canny musics Not canny I asked How can that be Na said he it will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta heid upon his body [ ] Well said I there can be no bogles here Neil for it s not likely they would fash themselves to frighten solan geese Ay says Andie is that what ye think of it But I ll can tell ye there s been waur nor bogles here What s waur than bogles Andie said I Warlocks said he Or a warlock at the least of it And that s a queer tale too he added And if ye would like I ll tell it ye To be sure we were all of the one mind and even the Highlander that had the least English of the three set himself to listen with all his might My faither Tam Dale peace to his banes was a wild sploring lad in his young days wi little wisdom and [pg ]less grace He was fond of a lass and fond of a glass and fond of a ran dan but I could never hear tell that he was muckle use for honest employment Frae ae thing to anither he listed at last for a sodger and was in the garrison of this fort which was the first way that ony of the Dales cam to set foot upon the Bass Sorrow upon that service The governor brewed his ain ale it seems it was the warst conceivable The rock was proveesioned frae the shore with vivers the thing was ill guided and there were whiles when they but to fish and shoot solans for their diet To crown a thir was the Days of the Persecution The perishin cauld chalmers were all occupeed wi sants and martyrs the saut of the yearth of which it wasnae worthy And though Tam Dale carried a firelock there a single sodger and liked a lass and a glass as I was sayin the mind of the man was mair just than set with his position He had glints of the glory of the kirk there were whiles when his dander rase to see the Lord s sants misguided and shame covered him that he should be haulding a can le or carrying a firelock in so black a business There were nights of it when he was here on sentry the place a wheesht the frosts o winter maybe riving in the wa s and he would hear are o the prisoners strike up a psalm and the rest join in and the blessed sounds rising from the different chalmers or dungeons I would raither say so that this auld craig in the sea was like a pairt of [pg ]Heev n Black shame was on his saul his sins hove up before him muckle as the Bass and above a that chief sin that he should have a hand in hagging and hashing at Christ s Kirk But the truth is that he resisted the spirit Day cam there were the rousing companions and his guid resolves depairtit In thir days dwalled upon the Bass a man of God Peden the Prophet was his name Ye ll have heard tell of Prophet Peden There was never the wale of him sinsyne and it s a question wi mony if there ever was his like afore He was wild s a peat hag fearsome to look at fearsome to hear his face like the day of judgment The voice of him was like a solan s and dinnle d in folks lugs and the words of him like coals of fire Now there was a lass on the rock and I think she had little to do for it was nae place far dacent weemen but it seems she was bonny and her and Tam Dale were very well agreed It befell that Peden was in the gairden his lane at the praying when Tam and the lass cam by and what should the lassie do but mock with laughter at the sant s devotions He rose and lookit at the twa o them and Tam s knees knoitered thegether at the look of him But whan he spak it was mair in sorrow than in anger Poor thing poor thing says he and it was the lass he lookit at I hear you skirl and laugh he says but the Lord has a deid shot prepared for you and at that surprising judgment [pg ]ye shall skirl but the ae time Shortly thereafter she was daundering on the craigs wi twa three sodgers and it was a blawy day There cam a gowst of wind claught her by the coats and awa wi her bag and baggage And it was remarked by the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl Nae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam Dale but it passed again and him none the better Ae day he was flyting wi anither sodger lad Deil hae me quo Tam for he was a profane swearer And there was Peden glowering at him gash an waefu Peden wi his lang chafts an luntin een the maud happed about his kist and the hand of him held out wi the black nails upon the finger nebs for he had nae care of the body Fy fy poor man cries he the poor fool man Deil hae me quo he an I see the deil at his oxter The conviction of guilt and grace cam in on Tam like the deep sea he flang doun the pike that was in his hands I will nae mair lift arms against the cause o Christ says he and was as gude s word There was a sair fyke in the beginning but the governor seeing him resolved gied him his dischairge and he went and dwallt and merried in North Berwick and had aye a gude name with honest folk frae that day on It was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the Bass cam in the hands o the Da rymples and there was twa men soucht the chairge of it Baith were weel [pg ]qualified for they had baith been sodgers in the garrison and kent the gate to handle solans and the seasons and values of them Forby that they were baith or they baith seemed earnest professors and men of comely conversation The first of them was just Tam Dale my faither The second was ane Lapraik whom the folk ca d Tod Lapraik maistly but whether for his name or his nature I could never hear tell Weel Tam gaed to see Lapraik upon this business and took me that was a toddlin laddie by the hand Tod had his dwallin in the lang loan benorth the kirkyaird It s a dark uncanny loan forby that the kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o James the Saxt and the deevil s cantrips played therein when the Queen was on the seas and as for Tod s house it was in the mirkest end and was little liked by some that kenned the best The door was on the sneck that day and me and my faither gaed straucht in Tod was a wabster to his trade his loom stood in the but There he sat a muckle fat white hash of a man like creish wi a kind of a holy smile that gart me scunner The hand of him aye cawed the shuttle but his een was steeked We cried to him by his name we skirled in the deid lug of him we shook him by the shou ther Nae mainner o service There he sat on his dowp an cawed the shuttle and smiled like creish God be guid to us says Tam Dale this is no canny He had jimp said the word when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel Is this you Tam says he Haith man I m blythe to see ye I whiles fa into a bit dwam like this he says it s frae the stamach Weel they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa was to get the warding o t and by little and little cam to very ill words and twined in anger I mind weel that as my faither and me gaed hame again he cam ower and ower the same expression how little he likit Tod Lapraik and his dwams Dwam says he I think folk hae brunt far dwams like yon Aweel my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin It was remembered sinsyne what way he had ta en the thing Tam says he ye hae gotten the better o me aince mair and I hope says he ye ll find at least a that ye expeckit at the Bass Which have since been thought remarkable expressions At last the time came for Tam Dale to take young solans This was a business he was weel used wi he had been a craigsman frae a laddie and trustit nane but himsel So there was he hingin by a line an speldering on the craig face whaur it s hieest and steighest Fower tenty lads were on the tap hauldin the line and mindin for his signals But whaur Tam hung there was naething but the craig and the sea belaw and the solans skirling and flying It was a braw spring morn and Tam [pg ]whustled as he claught in the young geese Mony s the time I heard him tell of this experience and aye the swat ran upon the man It chanced ye see that Tam keeked up and he was awaur of a muckle solan and the solan pyking at the line He thocht this by ordinar and outside the creature s habits He minded that ropes was unco saft things and the solan s neb and the Bass Rock unco hard and that twa hunner feet were raither mair than he would care to fa Shoo says Tam Awa bird Shoo awa wi ye says he The solan keekit doun into Tam s face and there was something unco in the creature s ee Just the ae keek it gied and back to the rope But now it wroucht and warstl t like a thing dementit There never was the solan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht and it seemed to understand it s employ brawly birzing the saft rope between the neb of it and a crunkled jag o stane There gaed a cauld stend o fear into Tam s heart This thing is nae bird thinks he His een turnt backward in his heid and the day gaed black about him If I get a dwam here he thoucht it s by wi Tam Dale And he signalled for the lads to pu him up And it seemed the solan understood about signals For nae sooner was the signal made than he let be the [pg ]rope spried his wings squawked out loud took a turn flying and dashed straucht at Tam Dale s een Tam had a knife he gart the cauld steel glitter And it seemed the solan understood about knives for nae suner did the steel glint in the sun than he gied the ae squawk but laigher like a body disappointit and flegged aff about the roundness of the craig and Tam saw him nae mair And as sune as that thing was gane Tam s held drapt upon his shouther and they pu d him up like a deid corp dadding on the craig A dram of brandy which he went never without broucht him to his mind or what was left of it Up he sat Rin Geordie rin to the boat mak sure of the boat man rin he cries or yon solan ll have it awa says he The fower lads stared at ither an tried to whilly wha him to be quiet But naething would satisfy Tam Dale till ane o them had startit on aheid to stand sentry on the boat The ithers askit if he was for down again Na says he and niether you nor me says he and as sune as I can win to stand on my twa feet we ll be aff frae this craig o Sawtan Sure eneuch nae time was lost and that was ower muckle for before they won to North Berwick Tam was in a crying fever He lay a the simmer and wha was sae kind as come speiring for him but Tod [pg ]Lapraik Folk thocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam near the house the fever had worsened I kenna for that but what I ken the best that was the end of it It was about this time o the year my grandfaither was out at the white fishing and like a bairn I but to gang wi him We had a grand take I mind and the way that the fish lay broucht us near in by the Bass whaur we forgaithered wi anither boat that belanged to a man Sandie Fletcher in Castleton He s no lang deid niether or ye could spier at himsel Weel Sandie hailed What s yon on the Bass says he On the Bass says grandfaither Ay says Sandie on the green side o t Whatten kind of a thing says grandfaither There cannae be naething on the Bass but just the sheep It looks unco like a body quo Sandie who was nearer in A body says we and we nane of us likit that For there was nae boat that could have broucht a man and the key o the prison yett hung ower my faither s held at hame in the press bed We keept the twa boats closs for company and crap in nearer hand Grandfaither had a gless for he had been a sailor and the captain of a smack and had lost her on the sands of Tay And when we took the [pg ]gless to it sure eneuch there was a man He was in a crunkle o green brae a wee below the chaipel a by his lee lane and lowped and flang and danced like a daft quean at a waddin It s Tod says grandfaither and passed the gless to Sandie Ay it s him says Sandie Or ane in the likeness o him says grandfaither Sma is the differ quo Sandie De il or warlock I ll try the gun at him quo he and broucht up a fowling piece that he aye carried for Sandie was a notable famous shot in all that country Haud your hand Sandie says grandfaither we maun see clearer first says he or this may be a dear day s wark to the baith of us Hout says Sandie this is the Lord s judgments surely and be damned to it says he Maybe ay and maybe no says my grandfaither worthy man But have you a mind of the Procurator Fiscal that I think ye ll have forgaithered wi before says he This was ower true and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee Aweel Edie says he and what would be your way of it Ou just this says grandfaither Let me that has the fastest boat gang back to North Berwick and let you bide here and keep an eye on Thon If I cannae find Lapraik I ll join ye and the twa of us ll [pg ]have a crack wi him But if Lapraik s at hame I ll rin up the flag at the harbour and ye can try Thon Thing wi the gun Aweel so it was agreed between them twa I was just a bairn an clum in Sandie s boat whaur I thoucht I would see the best of the employ My grandsire gied Sandie a siller tester to pit in his gun wi the leid draps bein mair deidly again bogles And then the ae boat set aff for North Berwick an the tither lay whaur it was and watched the wanchancy thing on the braeside A the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and span like a teetotum and whiles we could hear it skelloch as it span I hae seen lassies the daft queans that would lowp and dance a winter s nicht and still be lowping and dancing when the winter s day cam in But there would be folk there to hauld them company and the lads to egg them on and this thing was its lee lane And there would be a fiddler diddling his elbock in the chimney side and this thing had nae music but the skirling of the solans And the lassies were bits o young things wi the reid life dinnling and stending in their members and this was a muckle fat crieshy man and him fa n in the vale o years Say what ye like I maun say what I believe It was joy was in the creature s heart the joy o hell I daursay joy whatever Mony a time I have askit mysel why witches and warlocks should [pg ]sell their sauls whilk are their maist dear possessions and be auld duddy wrunkl t wives or auld feckless doddered men and then I mind upon Tod Lapraik dancing a they hours by his lane in the black glory of his heart Nae doubt they burn for it in muckle hell but they have a grand time here of it whatever and the Lord forgie us Weel at the hinder end we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mast held upon the harbour rocks That was a Sandie waited for He up wi the gun took a deleeberate aim an pu d the trigger There cam a bang and then ae waefu skirl frae the Bass And there were we rubbin our een and lookin at ither like daft folk For wi the bang and the skirl the thing had clean disappeared The sun glintit the wund blew and there was the bare yaird whaur the Wonder had been lowping and flinging but ae second syne The hale way hame I roared and grat wi the terror of that dispensation The grawn folk were nane sae muckle better there was little said in Sandie s boat but just the name of God and when we won in by the pier the harbour rocks were fair black wi the folk waitin us It seems they had fund Lapraik in ane of his dwams cawing the shuttle and smiling Ae lad they sent to hoist the flag and the rest abode there in the wabster s house You may be sure they liked it little but it was a means of grace to severals that stood there praying in to themsel s for nane cared to pray [pg ]out loud and looking on thon awesome thing as it cawed the shuttle Syne upon a suddenty and wi the ae driedfu skelloch Tod sprang up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit on the wab a bluidy corp When the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff upon the warlock s body sorrow a leid drap was to be fund but there was grandfather s siller tester in the puddock s heart of him Andie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair that had its consequence Neil as I have said was himself a great narrator I have heard since that he knew all the stories in the Highlands and thought much of himself and was thought much of by others on the strength of it Now Andie s tale reminded him of one he had already heard She would ken that story afore he said She was the story of Uistean More M Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar Vore It is no sic a thing cried Andie It is the story of my faither now wi God and Tod Lapraik And the same in your beard says he and keep the tongue of ye inside your Hielant chafts In dealing with Highlanders it will be found and has been shown in history how well it goes with Lowland gentlefolk but the thing appears scarce feasible for Lowland commons I had already remarked that Andie was continually on the point of quarrelling with [pg ]our three Macgregors and now sure enough it was to come Thir will be no words to use to shentlemans says Neil Shentlemans cries Andie Shentlemans ye hielant stot If God would give ye the grace to see yoursel the way that ithers see ye ye would throw your denner up There came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil and the black knife was in his hand that moment There was no time to think and I caught the Highlander by the leg and had him down and his armed hand pinned out before I knew what I was doing His comrades sprang to rescue him Andie and I were without weapons the Gregara three to two It seemed we were beyond salvation when Neil screamed in his own tongue ordering the others back and made his submission to myself in a manner the most abject even giving me up his knife which upon a repetition of his promises I returned to him on the morrow Two things I saw plain the first that I must not build too high on Andie who had shrunk against the wall and stood there as pale as death till the affair was over the second the strength of my own position with the Highlanders who must have received extraordinary charges to be tender of my safety But if I thought Andie came not very well out in courage I had no fault to find with him upon the account of gratitude It [pg ]was not so much that he troubled me with thanks as that his whole mind and manner appeared changed and as he preserved ever after a great timidity of our companions he and I were yet more constantly together highlander n
