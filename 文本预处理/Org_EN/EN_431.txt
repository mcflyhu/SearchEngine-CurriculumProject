He looked up into the darkness and waited He would let her sleep a minute there was little danger now The city waited over there with its low lights and the friendly night shut them in Before the morning dawned he should bring her home safe home A kind of simple pride held him and his heart leaped a little to the stars and sang with them as he squatted in the low grass keeping guard Presently he leaned and touched her She started with a shiver and sprang up rubbing her eyes and crying out I had a dream she said softly a beautiful dream Then her eyes caught the stars and blinked to them through dusty sleep and she turned to him with swift cry You re here she said It s not a dream It s you And Achilles laughed out We re going home he said when you re rested a little But I m rested now she cried Come She sprang to her feet and they journeyed again through the night About them the plain breathed deep sleeping power and the long road stretched from the west to the east and brought them home Each step the city lights grew larger and sparkled more and spread apart farther and a low rumble came creeping on the plain jarring with swift jolts the clang of cars and lifting life and in the distance a line of light ran fire swiftly on the air and darted red and green and trailed again in fire and Achilles s finger pointed to it That fire will take us home he said The child s eye followed the flashing cars and she smiled out The first light of the city s rim touched her face Just a little farther said Achilles But I am not tired said the child and she ran a little beside him on the stone pavement her small shoes clumping happily Achilles lifted a swift hand to a waiting car The car clanged its gone impatient A big conductor reached down his hand to the child The bell clanged again and they were off Clang clang clear the track Betty Harris is going home This is the people s carriage Going home Going home Clear the track clang clang Through the blinking city streets they rode Safe among the friendly houses and the shops and the stores and the people sleeping behind their blinds all the people who had loved the child and scanned the paper for her every day and asked Is Betty Harris found Going home Going home They would waken in the morning and read the news and shout across the way She s been found yes a Greek He brought her home Thank God She s found And little Betty Harris leaning against the great shoulder beside her nodded in the car and dreamed little dreams and looked about her hazily The conductor came and stood in front of them with extended hand and rang the fares and cast an indifferent kindly glance at the Greek and his child travelling by night He did not guess the scoop that his two little nickels rang out The child with roughened hair and clumsy hanging shoes was nothing to him nor to the policeman that boarded the car at the next corner and ran his eye down its empty length to the Greek sitting erect with the child sleeping beside him her dark tousled head against his arm The conductor came again and touched Achilles on the shoulder and bent to him You change here he said He was pointing to a car across the square You take that he said You understand He shouted a little because the man was a foreigner and dark but his tone was friendly And Achilles got to his feet guiding the sleepy child down the rib floored car that shook beneath them And the conductor and policeman watched the two figures vanish through the door and smiled to each other a friendly smile at foreign folks who travel in strange ways and go among us with eager intent faces fixed on some shining goal we cannot see with the patience of the centuries leaning down to them and watching them squatted v squat He squatted down beside the footprints and examined them closely He squatted in the grass discussing with someone rumble n v I hear the rumble of thunder in the distance We could tell from the rumble of the thunder that rain was coming darted v dart The lizard darted out its tongue at the insect The old man was displeased and darted an angry look at me pointed adj He gave me a very sharp pointed pencil She wished to show Mrs John Dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother rim n The water was even with the rim of the basin She looked at him over the rim of her glass clumping v clump Wipe the wand off before the first coat to prevent clumping Fighting gravitational clumping would take a wavelength of a few dozen light years hazily ad vaguely not clear He remembered her only hazily We saw the distant hills hazily kindly adj adv Her neighbours spoke of her as kindly and hospitable A shadow passed over the kindly face of the old woman bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them fixed adj Have you two fixed on a date for the wedding yet Once the aim is fixed we should not change it arbitrarily
