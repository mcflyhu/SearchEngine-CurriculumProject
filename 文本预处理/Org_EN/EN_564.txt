Several hours later at the first uncertain flush of dawn at the instant when shepherds and fisherman awake they were returning joyously the smugglers having finished their undertaking Having started on foot and gone with infinite precautions to be silent through ravines through woods through fords of rivers they were returning as if they were people who had never anything to conceal from anybody in a bark of Fontarabia hired under the eyes of Spain s custom house officers through the Bidassoa river All the mass of mountains and of clouds all the sombre chaos of the preceding night had disentangled itself almost suddenly as under the touch of a magic wand The Pyrenees returned to their real proportions were only average mountains with slopes bathed in a shadow still nocturnal but with peaks neatly cut in a sky which was already clearing The air had become lukewarm suave exquisite as if the climate or the season had suddenly changed and it was the southern wind which was beginning to blow the delicious southern wind special to the Basque country which chases before it the cold the clouds and the mists which enlivens the shades of all things makes the sky blue prolongs the horizons infinitely and gives even in winter summer illusions The boatman who was bringing the smugglers back to France pushed the bottom of the river with his long pole and the bark dragged half stranded At this moment that Bidassoa by which the two countries are separated seemed drained and its antique bed excessively large had the flat extent of a small desert The day was decidedly breaking tranquil and slightly pink It was the first of the month of November on the Spanish shore very distant in a monastery an early morning bell rang clear announcing the religious solemnity of every autumn And Ramuntcho comfortably seated in the bark softly cradled and rested after the fatigues of the night breathed the new breeze with well being in all his senses With a childish joy he saw the assurance of a radiant weather for that All Saints Day which was to bring to him all that he knew of this world s festivals the chanted high mass the game of pelota before the assembled village then at last the dance of the evening with Gracieuse the fandango in the moon light on the church square He lost little by little the consciousness of his physical life Ramuntcho after his sleepless night a sort of torpor benevolent under the breath of the virgin morning benumbed his youthful body leaving his mind in a dream He knew well such impressions and sensations for the return at the break of dawn in the security of a bark where one sleeps is the habitual sequel of a smuggler s expedition And all the details of the Bidassoa s estuary were familiar to him all its aspects which changed with the hour with the monotonous and regular tide Twice every day the sea wave comes to this flat bed then between France and Spain there is a lake a charming little sea with diminutive blue waves and the barks float the barks go quickly the boatmen sing their old time songs which the grinding and the shocks of the cadenced oars accompany But when the waters have withdrawn as at this moment there remains between the two countries only a sort of lowland uncertain and of changing color where walk men with bare legs where barks drag themselves creeping They were now in the middle of this lowland Ramuntcho and his band half dozing under the dawning light The colors of things began to appear out of the gray of night They glided they advanced by slight jerks now through yellow velvet which was sand then through a brown thing striped regularly and dangerous to walkers which was slime And thousands of little puddles left by the tide of the day before reflected the dawn shone on the soft extent like mother of pearl shells On the little yellow and brown desert their boatman followed the course of a thin silver stream which represented the Bidassoa at low tide From time to time some fisherman crossed their path passed near them in silence without singing as the custom is in rowing too busy poling standing in his bark and working his pole with beautiful plastic gestures While they were day dreaming they approached the French shore the smugglers On the other side of the strange zone which they were traversing as in a sled that silhouette of an old city which fled from them slowly was Fontarabia those highlands which rose to the sky with figures so harsh were the Spanish Pyrenees All this was Spain mountainous Spain eternally standing there in the face of them and incessantly preoccupying their minds a country which one must reach in silence in dark nights in nights without moonlight under the rain of winter a country which is the perpetual aim of dangerous expeditions a country which for the men of Ramuntcho s village seems always to close the southwestern horizon while it changes in appearance according to the clouds and the hours a country which is the first to be lighted by the pale sun of mornings and which masks afterward like a sombre screen the red sun of evenings He adored his Basque land Ramuntcho and this morning was one of the times when this adoration penetrated him more profoundly In his after life during his exile the reminiscence of these delightful returns at dawn after the nights of smuggling caused in him an indescribable and very anguishing nostalgia But his love for the hereditary soil was not as simple as that of his companions As in all his sentiments as in all his sensations there were mingled in it diverse elements At first the instinctive and unanalyzed attachment of his maternal ancestors to the native soil then something more refined coming from his father an unconscious reflection of the artistic admiration which had retained the stranger here for several seasons and had given to him the caprice of allying himself with a girl of these mountains in order to obtain a Basque descendance joyously
