The weather in the end considerably worsened the wind sang in the shrouds the sea swelled higher and the ship began to labour and cry out among the billows The song of the leadsman in the chains was now scarce ceasing for we thrid all the way among shoals About nine in the morning in a burst of wintry sun between two squalls of hail I had my first look of Holland a line of windmills birling in the breeze It was besides my first knowledge of these daft like contrivances which gave me a near sense of foreign travel and a new world and life We came to an anchor about half past eleven outside the harbour of Helvoetsluys in a place where the sea sometimes broke and the ship pitched outrageously You may be sure we were all on deck save Mrs Gebbie some of us in cloaks others mantled in the ship s tarpaulins all clinging on by ropes and jesting the most like old sailor folk that we could imitate Presently a boat that was backed like a partan crab came gingerly alongside and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch Thence Captain Sang [pg ]turned very troubled like to Catriona and the rest of us crowding about the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all The Rose was bound to the port of Rotterdam whither the other passengers were in a great impatience to arrive in view of a conveyance due to leave that very evening in the direction of the Upper Germany This with the present half gale of wind the captain if no time were lost declared himself still capable to save Now James More had trysted in Helvoet with his daughter and the captain had engaged to call before the port and place her according to the custom in a shore boat There was the boat to be sure and there was Catriona ready but both our master and the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk and the first was in no humour to delay Your father said he would be gey an little pleased if we was to break a leg to ye Miss Drummond let a be drowning of you Take my way of it says he and come on by with the rest of us here to Rotterdam Ye can get a passage down the Maes in a sailing scoot as far to the Brill and thence on again by a place in a rattel waggon back to Helvoet But Catriona would hear of no change She looked white like as she beheld the bursting of the sprays the green seas that sometimes poured upon the forecastle and the perpetual bounding and swooping of the boat among the billows but she stood firmly by her father s orders My father James More will have arranged [pg ]it so was her first word and her last I thought it very idle and indeed wanton in the girl to be so literal and stand opposite to so much kind advice but the fact is she had a very good reason if she would have told us Sailing scoots and rattel waggons are excellent things only the use of them must first be paid for and all she was possessed of in the world was just two shillings and a penny halfpenny sterling So it fell out that captain and passengers not knowing of her destitution and she being too proud to tell them spoke in vain But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither said one It is very true says she but since the year there are so many of the honest Scots abroad that I will be doing very well I thank you There was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some laugh others looked the more sorry and Mr Gebbie fall outright in a passion I believe he knew it was his duty his wife having accepted charge of the girl to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe nothing would have induced him to have done so since it must have involved the loss of his conveyance and I think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice At least he broke out upon Captain Sang raging and saying the thing was a disgrace that it was mere death to try to leave the ship and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers and leave [pg ]her to her fate I was thinking something of the same took the mate upon one side arranged with him to send on my chests by track scoot to an address I had in Leyden and stood up and signalled to the fishers I will go ashore with the young lady Captain Sang said I It is all one what way I go to Leyden and leaped at the same time into the boat which I managed not so elegantly but what I fell with two of the fishers in the bilge From the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from the ship she stood so high over us swung down so swift and menaced us so perpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable I began to think I had made a fool s bargain that it was merely impossible Catriona should be got on board to me and that I stood to be set ashore at Helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure of embracing James More if I should want to But this was to reckon without the lass s courage She had seen me leap with very little appearance however much reality of hesitation to be sure she was not to be beat by her discarded friend Up she stood on the bulwarks and held by a stay the wind blowing in her petticoats which made the enterprise more dangerous and gave us rather more of a view of her stockings than would be thought genteel in cities There was no minute lost and scarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the same I stood up on the other [pg ]side and spread my arms the ship swung down on us the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was perhaps wholly safe and Catriona leaped into the air I was so happy as to catch her and the fishers readily supporting us escaped a fall She held to me a moment very tight breathing quick and deep thence she still clinging to me with both hands we were passed aft to our places by the steersman and Captain Sang and all the crew and passengers cheering and crying farewell the boat was put about for shore As soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me suddenly but said no word No more did I and indeed the whistling of the wind and the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech and our crew not only toiled excessively but made extremely little way so that the Rose had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached the harbour mouth We were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon according to their beastly Hollands custom stopped his boat and required of us our fares Two guilders was the man s demand between three and four shillings English money for each passenger But at this Catriona began to cry out with a vast deal of agitation She had asked of Captain Sang she said and the fare was but an English shilling Do you think I will have come on board and not ask first cries she The patroon scolded back upon her in a lingo where the oaths [pg ]were English and the rest right Hollands till at last seeing her near tears I privately slipped in the rogue s hand six shillings whereupon he was obliging enough to receive from her the other shilling without more complaint No doubt I was a good deal nettled and ashamed I like to see folk thrifty but not with so much passion and I daresay it would be rather coldly that I asked her as the boat moved on again for shore where it was that she was trysted with her father He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott an honest Scotch merchant says she and then with the same breath I am wishing to thank you very much you are a brave friend to me It will be time enough when I get you to your father said I little thinking that I spoke so true I can tell him a fine tale of a loyal daughter O I do not think I will be a loyal girl at all events she cried with a great deal of painfulness in the expression I do not think my heart is true Yet there are very few that would have made that leap and all to obey a father s orders I observed I cannot have you to be thinking of me so she cried again When you had done that same how would I stop behind And at all events that was not all the reasons Whereupon with a burning face she told me the plain truth upon her poverty Good guide us cried I what kind of daft like proceeding is this to let yourself be launched on the [pg ]continent of Europe with an empty purse I count it hardly decent scant decent I cried You forget James More my father is a poor gentleman said she He is a hunted exile But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles I exclaimed And was this fair to them that care for you Was it fair to me was it fair to Miss Grant that counselled you to go and would be driven fair horn mad if she could hear of it Was it even fair to these Gregory folk that you were living with and used you lovingly It s a blessing you have fallen in my hands Suppose your father hindered by an accident what would become of you here and you your lee alone in a strange place The thought of the thing frightens me I said I will have lied to all of them she replied I will have told them all that I had plenty I told her too I could not be lowering James More to them I found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very dust for the lie was originally the father s not the daughter s and she thus obliged to persevere in it for the man s reputation But at the time I was ignorant of this and the mere thought of her destitution and the perils in which she must have fallen had ruffled me almost beyond reason Well well well said I you will have to learn more sense I left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the [pg ]shore where I got a direction for Sprott s house in my new French and we walked there it was some little way beholding the place with wonder as we went Indeed there was much for Scots folk to admire canals and trees being intermingled with the houses the houses each within itself of a brave red brick the colour of a rose with steps and benches of blue marble at the cheek of every door and the whole town so clean you might have dined upon the causeway Sprott was within upon his ledgers in a low parlour very neat and clean and set out with china and pictures and a globe of the earth in a brass frame He was a big chafted ruddy lusty man with a crooked hard look to him and he made us not that much civility as offer us a seat Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet sir says I I ken nobody by such a name says he impatient like Since you are so particular says I I will amend my question and ask you where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond alias Macgregor alias James More late tenant in Iveronachile Sir says he he may be in Hell for what I ken and for my part I wish he was The young lady is that gentleman s daughter sir said I before whom I think you will agree with me it is not very becoming to discuss his character [pg ] I have nothing to make either with him or her or you cries he in his gross voice Under your favour Mr Sprott said I this young lady is come from Scotland seeking him and by whatever mistake was given the name of your house for a direction An error it seems to have been but I think this places both you and me who am but her fellow traveller by accident under a strong obligation to help our countrywoman Will you ding me daft he cries I tell ye I ken naething and care less either for him or his breed I tell ye the man owes me money That may very well be sir said I who was now rather more angry than himself At least I owe you nothing the young lady is under my protection and I am neither at all used with these manners nor in the least content with them As I said this and without particularly thinking what I did I drew a step or two nearer to his table thus striking by mere good fortune on the only argument that could at all affect the man The blood left his lusty countenance For the Lord s sake dinna be hasty sir he cried I am truly wishfu no to be offensive But ye ken sir I m like a wheen guid natured honest canty auld fallows my bark is waur nor my bite To hear me ye micht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour but na na its a kind auld fellow at heart Sandie Sprott [pg ]And ye could never imagine the fyke and fash this man has been to me Very good sir said I Then I will make that much freedom with your kindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr Drummond You re welcome sir said he As for the young leddy my respec s to her he ll just have clean forgotten her I ken the man ye see I have lost siller by him ere now He thinks of naebody but just himsel clan king or dauchter if he can get his wameful he would give them a the go by ay or his correspondent either For there is a sense in whilk I may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent The fact is we are employed thegether in a business affair and I think it s like to turn out a dear affair for Sandie Sprott The man s as guid s my pairtner and I give ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is He micht be coming here to Helvoet he micht come here the morn he michtnae come for a twalmonth I would wonder at naething or just at the ae thing and that s if he was to pay me my siller Ye see what way I stand with it and it s clear I m no very likely to meddle up with the young leddy as ye ca her She cannae stop here that s ae thing certain sure Dod sir I m a lone man If I was to tak her in its highly possible the hellicat would try and gar me marry her when he turned up Enough of this talk said I I will take the [pg ]young lady among better friends Give me pen ink and paper and I will leave here for James More the address of my correspondent in Leyden He can inquire from me where he is to seek his daughter This word I wrote and sealed which while I was doing Sprott of his own motion made a welcome offer to charge himself with Miss Drummond s mails and even send a porter for them to the inn I advanced him to that effect a dollar or two to be a cover and he gave me an acknowledgment in writing of the sum Whereupon I giving my arm to Catriona we left the house of this unpalatable rascal She had said no word throughout leaving me to judge and speak in her place I upon my side had been careful not to embarrass her by a glance and even now although my heart still glowed inside of me with shame and anger I made it my affair to seem quite easy Now said I let us get back to yon same inn where they can speak the French have a piece of dinner and inquire for conveyances to Rotterdam I will never be easy till I have you safe again in the hands of Mrs Gebbie I suppose it will have to be said Catriona though whoever will be pleased I do not think it will be her And I will remind you this once again that I have but one shilling and three baubees [pg ] And just this once again said I I
