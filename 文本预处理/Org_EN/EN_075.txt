It wasn t far to the edge of the cornfield from the farmyard fence And Henrietta Hen was quick to discover that the freshly ploughed and harrowed field offered a fine place to scratch for all kinds of worms and bugs and grubs Not being what you might call a wise bird like old Mr Crow Henrietta didn t know that Farmer Green had carefully planted corn in that field in long rows She did exclaim however that she was in great luck when now and then she unearthed a few kernels of corn But she wasn t looking for corn She merely ate it when she happened to find any It is no wonder then that she was amazed when a hoarse voice suddenly cried right in her ear almost You re a thief and you can t deny it She jumped How could she have helped it And the voice exclaimed There You re guilty or you d never have jumped like that Turning Henrietta saw that a black beady eyed gentleman was staring at her sternly It takes Mr Crow to catch em he croaked He can tell a corn thief half a mile away All this time Henrietta Hen hadn t said a word At first she was too surprised And afterward she was too angry Why don t you speak he demanded He dearly loved a quarrel And somehow it wasn t much fun quarrelling with anybody when the other party wouldn t say a word Still Henrietta Hen didn t open her mouth She puzzled Mr Crow He even forgot his rage for it always made him angry if anybody but himself scratched up any corn What s the matter with you he asked What s the reason you don t speak I m too proud to talk with you said Henrietta Hen I don t care to be seen speaking to you sir Ha Mr Crow exploded Don t you think I m as good as you are No said Henrietta Hen No I don t Mr Crow was all for arguing with her He began to tell Henrietta many things about himself how he had spent dozens of summers in Pleasant Valley what a great traveller he was how far he could fly in a day There was no end to his boasting Yet Henrietta Hen never looked the least bit interested Indeed she began scratching for worms while he was talking And that made the old fellow angrier than ever Don t you dare eat another kernel of corn he thundered If you do I ll have to tell Farmer Green He feeds me corn every day cracked corn said Henrietta Well I never cried Mr Crow What s he thinking of wasting good corn like that Really I mustn t be seen talking with you Henrietta Hen told Mr Crow If you want to know the answer to your question come over to the barnyard and ask the Rooster He ll give you an answer that you won t like And then she walked away with stately steps Mr Crow watched her with a baleful gleam in his eyes He knew well enough what Henrietta meant The Rooster would rather fight him than not And though Mr Crow loved a quarrel he never cared to indulge in anything more dangerous than harsh words I don t know what the farm s coming to he croaked Here s Farmer Green wasting corn on such as her and cracking it for her too So saying the old gentleman turned his back on Henrietta Hen who was already fluttering through the farmyard fence And thereupon he scratched up enough corn for a hearty meal grumbling meanwhile because it wasn t cracked for him Somehow he muttered I can t help wishing I was a speckled hen bugs adj n bug [ ] All programs have bugs and need endless refinement The sacks of rice were swarming with bugs unearthed Many unearthed cultural relics are set forth in the exhibition hall Some utensils were in a state of decay when they were unearthed kernel n The kernel of his problem is lack of money The nutshell includes the kernel kernels kernel These stones contain kernels Resolving kernels and standard errors can also be computed for each block hoarse adj He asked me a question in a hoarse voice He was too excited and roared himself hoarse croaked v croak The crow croaked disaster she has a fine head for it croaked Jacques Three afterward adv Let s go to the theatre first and eat afterward Afterward the boy became a very famous artist hearty adj After work they made a hearty meal in the worker s canteen We accorded him a hearty welcome grumbling adj She s always grumbling to me about how badly she s treated at work We didn t hear any grumbling about the food
