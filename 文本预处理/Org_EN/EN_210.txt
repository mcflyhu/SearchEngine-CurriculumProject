Before those two were visible to the group round Duncombe front door or within hailing distance of us they turned into the bypath leading to Big Klaus s I could not tell whether Eric had seen us But I was quite sure Lady Helmstone had Sure too that she had deliberately avoided us Ranny didn t want to come back with me and I didn t press him I promised him I would say he was going to walk across the heath to the inn had to get back expecting a telegram I stayed behind in the gorse bushes alone till I saw Lord Helmstone and all his party going home I couldn t bear the thought of meeting Betty I went round by the kitchen and crept up the back stairs I listened at my mother s door Not a sound Then I heard Betty downstairs playing the accompaniment to a song she and Ranny used to sing So I opened my mother s door and went in [Pg ] The first thing she said was without any preface I know now why Lady Helmstone invited a child like Bettina to go yachting for six months rather than you So do I I answered they all adore Bettina And then she is Hermione s special friend There is another reason my mother said looking out of the window A reason that concerns Lady Barbara Then she glanced at me a little shyly and away her eyes went again to the window Lord Helmstone thinks a sea voyage would be the best thing in the world for Mr Annan They are asking him to be one of the party I felt as if some hard substance had struck me violently in the face But I managed to bring out the words Is he going do you think No doubt he will go she said Already I seemed to have lost him as utterly as though he had died Yet with none of that sad comfort my mother had spoken of the comfort of knowing one s possession safe beyond all risk of loss or tarnishing [Pg ] I had never been on a yacht I had never seen a yacht Yet I could see Eric on the Nautch Girl And Lady Barbara Her mother s words came back Very little is done at balls Very much the story books had told me was done by throwing people together on a long voyage My own heart told me the same Yes I had lost him And I had lost myself The next day was Sunday In the morning Hermione came to carry Bettina off for their last day together I had to promise that if Ranny should come to Duncombe I would send for Betty As I sat with my mother that same afternoon the door opened and there was the maid bringing in Mr Annan I think I scarcely spoke or moved It was my mother who said I thought you would come to say good bye Good bye Then with unusual brusquerie[Pg ] where my mother was concerned he added When I come to see people what I say is How do you do But aren t you going away to morrow Why should I Why to catch the Nautch Girl I can t think of a girl I should so little care to catch And he wasn t going at all Had never contemplated it for a moment The weight of the world fell off my shoulders And for nearly five minutes of a joy almost too great to be borne I believed that it was because of me he wasn t going Then he told my mother it was because of his work And so it was that unconsciously he made good the excuse I had offered for his bolting off the afternoon I told him my secret He seemed to have forgotten that episode At least he behaved as though it had never happened He laughed a little over his interview with her ladyship Very determined individual Lady Helmstone He had told her finally that he hadn t time even to go to his sister s wedding He had not thought it necessary he said to add[Pg ] that he wouldn t have gone to his sister s wedding however much time he had Of course my mother asked why such unbrotherly behaviour He told us that he didn t approve of the marriage There was nothing against the man s character He was a Writer to the Signet which seemed in Scotland to mean a sort of barrister I said Writer to the Signet sounded much finer than barrister I was told that Maggie Annan could not be expected to live on a fine sound And that was about all they would have This particular Writer to the Signet was poor Oh poorer than poor I didn t like his way of saying that As we went downstairs I was rather glad of being able to disagree with him about something It would keep me from being foolish I had that feeling of the creature who has been straining long at bonds and finds the sudden loosing a test of equilibrium For fear I should seem too gloriously content with him I taxed Eric with thinking over much about money He said a man may put up with any sort of hardship he likes for himself But no man had a right to marry till he could support a wife in some sort of comfort I[Pg ] suggested that perhaps Maggie Annan cared less about comfort than she cared about other things He retorted that Maggie probably hadn t thought it out at all She was acting on impulse To think it out that was the man s business And so on I felt myself growing impatient when he said comfort for the second time When people are old yes Comfort then But when they re young what does it matter He leaned against the newel of the staircase and looked at me quite surprised I thought you were more practical he said I am practical That s why I say comfort is wasted on the young They don t even want it unless they re rather horrid sort of young people Thank you he said laughing and I felt hot I tried to explain Such a lot of things were fun when you were young especially when they were shared I had noticed that Things that made you cross and made you ill when you were older Suddenly I stopped saying in my heart Heavens isn t this the kind of foolishness I was hoping to be saved from Or is it worse For Eric was smiling in such a disconcerting way [Pg ] I said primly that Miss Maggie did not need me to defend her and that I must not keep him from his work That word was like the touch of a whip In two seconds he was gone The next day Monday just the same He ran in only for a moment to see my mother He could not sit down he could not do this nor that Work work It had seized him in a fresh grip I was thankful to the work for having carried him away that Monday afternoon when Betty came back from seeing the Helmstones off It was a Betty we had never seen before I don t know what else Hermione had said to her but Betty had been told that she too might have gone yachting It was like a stab to see my mother s face now and to remember the confidence with which she had quoted the old story about Bettina s insisting on the promise that she should not be made to pay visits Not never Not never I had hated Lady Helmstone for saying that Bettina would in her ladyship s opinion be found to have outgrown her reluctance It was true [Pg ] Bettina wanted to go My mother unwisely I felt reminded Betty of the old pledge I was a baby then What did I know And now there were tears in Bettina s eyes because she was not going to leave her mother I don t like to think of those next days They were all a strain and a tangle I cannot imagine what we should have done without Eric For the way Bettina took her disappointment made my mother positively ill Eric s prescription was hard to fill Peace of mind absolute quiet and tranquillity You are less alarmed he said in that direct way of his than you were that first day you brought me here But you have more reason I did not want Bettina fully to realise the cloud that was so surely gathering to burst and yet I was angry at her failure to realise So unreasonable so unkind I found I could be Oh I lost patience more than once But my mother never You will see all the beautiful places some day my darling [Pg ] Bettina was sure she never should This had been her one chance who else was likely to take her The fit and proper person Your husband will take you as your father took me That answer surprised us both I could not blame Bettina for feeling that it seemed to postpone the delights of travel overlong The strange new Bettina went about the house settling to nothing at once restive and idle All on edge The worst sign of all was that she neglected her music My mother remonstrated What s the use You will find your music a very important part of your equipment Equipment said the new Bettina scornfully Equipment for what For taking your place in the world The world Bettina exchanged looks with me Yes the world seemed far away Inaccessible If we never go anywhere never see anyone what is the use in being equipped I think Bettina was sorry she said that The[Pg ] effect of it was as though some rude hand had thrown down a screen My mother looking up with hollow startled eyes must have caught a glimpse of something that she dreaded Don t put it off she whispered Write to your Aunt Josephine to night I composed my letter very carefully My sister and I had often wished I wrote that we had some acquaintance with our only relation Especially as she and our father had been so much to each other Our mother was in poor health We lived very quietly But we all hoped if ever Aunt Josephine came to this part of the world a very pretty part she would come to see us I was nearly nineteen now and I was hers affectionately Feeling myself very diplomatic and deep I enclosed the last photograph Hermione had taken of Bettina I wrote on it Betty at sixteen but it does not do her justice If anything could win her over it would be that snapshot of Betty dancing on Duncombe lawn I posted the letter in an access of remorse and wretchedness afraid I had left it too late For[Pg ] my mother had said After all instead of your leaving me I shall have to leave you That same night Eric told me that he had sent to London for a heart specialist And the heart specialist had answered he would be down on Thursday which was the day after to morrow I saw in Eric s face that he was anxious at the delay He admitted that he was afraid to wait Yes he would wire for another man Eric afraid You don t I whispered you don t mean quite soon He repeated that he was afraid Then I felt I knew all that any specialist could tell me That was the day I came to know the steadying influence of a call to face great issues They bring their own greatness with them They wrap it round our littleness Only afterwards thinking how gentle and watchful Eric looked in telling me I remembered that people were supposed to faint when they heard news like that For myself I had never felt so clear headed Never felt the responsibility of life so great Never felt[Pg ] that for us to fail in bearing our share was so unthinkable If this Majesty of Death were soon to clothe my mother her children must not hide and weep They must help her help each other to meet the Great King at the gate All the little troubles fell away I was kind again to Betty I called my lover Eric He called me by my name Just that No
