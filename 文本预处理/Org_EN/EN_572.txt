The changeable month of March had arrived and with it the intoxication of spring joyful for the young sad for those who are declining And Gracieuse had commenced again to sit in the twilight of the lengthened days on the stone bench in front of her door Oh the old stone benches around the houses made in the past ages for the reveries of the soft evenings and for the eternally similar conversations of lovers Gracieuse s house was very ancient like most houses in that Basque country where less than elsewhere the years change the things It had two stories a large projecting roof in a steep slope walls like a fortress which were whitewashed every summer very small windows with settings of cut granite and green blinds Above the front door a granite lintel bore an inscription in relief words complicated and long which to French eyes resembled nothing known It said May the Holy Virgin bless this home built in the year by Peter Detcharry beadle and his wife Damasa Irribarne of the village of Istaritz A small garden two yards wide surrounded by a low wall so that one could see the passers by separated the house from the road there was a beautiful rose laurel extending its southern foliage above the evening bench and there were yuccas a palm tree and enormous bunches of those hortensias which are giants here in this land of shade in this lukewarm climate so often enveloped by clouds In the rear was a badly closed orchard which rolled down to an abandoned path favorable to escalades of lovers What mornings radiant with light there were in that spring and what tranquil pink evenings After a week of full moon which kept the fields till day light blue with rays and when the band of Itchoua ceased to work so clear was their habitual domain so illuminated were the grand vaporous backgrounds of the Pyrenees and of Spain the frontier fraud was resumed more ardently as soon as the thinned crescent had become discreet and early setting Then in these beautiful times smuggling by night was exquisite a trade of solitude and of meditation when the mind of the naive and very pardonable defrauders was elevated unconsciously in the contemplation of the sky and of the darkness animated by stars as it happens to the mind of the sea folk watching on the nocturnal march of vessels and as it happened formerly to the mind of the shepherds in antique Chaldea It was favorable also and tempting for lovers that tepid period which followed the full moon of March for it was dark everywhere around the houses dark in all the paths domed with trees and very dark behind the Detcharry orchard on the abandoned path where nobody ever passed Gracieuse lived more and more on her bench in front of her door It was here that she was seated as every year to receive and look at the carnival dancers those groups of young boys and of young girls of Spain or of France who every spring organize themselves for several days in a wandering band and all dressed in the same pink or white colors traverse the frontier village dancing the fandango in front of houses with castanets She stayed later and later in this place which she liked under the shelter of the rose laurel coming into bloom and sometimes even she came out noiselessly through the window like a little sly fox to breathe there at length after her mother had gone to bed Ramuntcho knew this and every night
