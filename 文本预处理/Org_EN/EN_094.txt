Henrietta Hen was waiting as patiently as she could for the fair to come to an end She tried to close her ears to the boasts of her neighbors on either side of her that they were going to win the first prize She had heard too many unpleasant remarks about herself to have even the slightest hope of winning any prize at all let alone the first Anyhow we ll be going home tonight Henrietta said to herself And I ll never never never come to another fair I ll go and hide way up high in the haymow where they can t find me before I ll spend another week in a place like this While she was muttering under her breath like that some men came up to her pen And Henrietta Hen promptly squatted down in the furthest corner of it hoping they wouldn t say anything disagreeable about her She felt that she had already heard about all she could stand She didn t even look at her callers And soon they moved away Then Henrietta glanced up She noticed something blue dangling from the front of her pen And there was a greater commotion than ever on all sides of her What is it she cried What has happened Neighbor Number on her right shot a spiteful look at her Those stupid judges she spluttered They ve made a terrible blunder They ve gone and given you and your chicks the first prize And of course it was meant for me and mine It wasn t screamed Neighbor Number on Henrietta s left That prize was intended for me and my children Who won second and third cried a noisy hen from across the way They re both at the other end of the hall somebody shrieked It s an outrage It isn t fair We ve been cheated Henrietta Hen s nearest neighbors clamored But nobody paid any attention to them As for Henrietta she didn t quite know how to act She had intended when she left home to do a good deal of strutting back and forth in her pen with now and then a pause to preen herself to make sure that she looked her best But somehow she no longer cared to put on grand airs as of old She remembered that some of the other hens at the fair had been haughty and proud and had smoothed their feathers declaring boldly that they expected to win the first prize Henrietta had heard it said that fine feathers don t make fine birds And she knew at last what that meant It meant that gay clothes and lofty ways and boastful talk were of no account at all So Henrietta tried to behave as if nothing unusual had happened She told her chicks that they were going home that evening and that she would be glad to be back on the farm again among plain home folks At last Johnnie Green and his father came to load Henrietta and her family into the wagon Well said the old horse Ebenezer to Henrietta Did you enjoy the races I didn t have a chance to see them she replied That s a pity he told her And then he asked her What s that blue tag hanging from your pen That said Henrietta that means that my chicks won the first prize She helped win it herself cried old dog Spot who was yelping about the wagon Our little speckled hen was the best hen at the fair Nonsense Henrietta exclaimed But all the same she couldn t help being pleased promptly adv He paid the money back promptly She promptly seized the opportunity his absence gave her squatted v squat He squatted down beside the footprints and examined them closely He squatted in the grass discussing with someone dangling dangle The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost now The children sat on the high wall their legs dangling commotion n They made a commotion by yelling at each other in the theatre Suddenly the whole street was in commotion shrieked v shriek She shrieked in fright Li Mei t ing gave a shout and Lu Tzu hsiao shrieked Tell what outrage n vt When he heard the news he reacted with a sense of outrage We should never forget the outrage committed by the Japanese invaders strutting He too was exceedingly arrogant strutting about the castle The pompous lecturer is strutting and forth across the stage forth adv The wind moved the trees gently back and forth He gave forth a series of works in rapid succession preen v of men under spend at least minutes preening themselves every morning in the bathroom Bill preened his beard haughty adj He gave me a haughty look and walked away They were displeased with her haughty airs wagon n We have to fork the hay into the wagon The muddy road bemired the wagon yelping v yelp In the middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur s yelping
