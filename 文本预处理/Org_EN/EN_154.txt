CHAPTER It was characteristic of the two that when the uproar broke out Vance Cornish raised his eyes but went on lighting his pipe Then his sister Elizabeth ran to the window with a swish of skirts around her long legs After the first shot there was a lull The little cattle town was as peaceful as ever with its storm shaken houses staggering away down the street A boy was stirring up the dust of the street enjoying its heat with his bare toes and the same old man was bunched in his chair in front of the store During the two days Elizabeth had been in town on her cattle buying trip she had never see him alter his position But she was accustomed to the West and this advent of sleep in the town did not satisfy her A drowsy town like a drowsy looking cow puncher might be capable of unexpected things Vance she said there s trouble starting Somebody shooting at a target he answered As if to mock him he had no sooner spoken than a dozen voices yelled down the street in a wailing chorus cut short by the rapid chattering of revolvers Vance ran to the window Just below the hotel the street made an elbow turn for no particular reason except that the original cattle trail had made exactly the same turn before Garrison City was built Toward the corner ran the hubbub at the pace of a running horse Shouts shrill trailing curses and the muffled beat of hoofs in the dust A rider plunged into view now his horse leaning far in to take the sharp angle and the dust skidding out and away from his sliding hoofs The rider gave easily and gracefully to the wrench of his mount And he seemed to have a perfect trust in his horse for he rode with the reins hanging over the horns of his saddle His hands were occupied by a pair of revolvers and he was turned in the saddle The head of the pursuing crowd lurched around the elbow turn fire spat twice from the mouth of each gun Two men dropped one rolling over and over in the dust and the other sitting down and clasping his leg in a ludicrous fashion But the crowd was checked and fell back By this time the racing horse of the fugitive had carried him close to the hotel and now he faced the front a handsome fellow with long black hair blowing about his face He wore a black silk shirt which accentuated the pallor of his face and the flaring crimson of his bandanna And he laughed joyously and the watchers from the hotel window heard him call Go it Mary Feed em dust girl The pursuers had apparently realized that it was useless to chase Another gust of revolver shots barked from the turning of the street and among them a different and more sinister sound like the striking of two great hammers face on face so that there was a cold ring of metal after the explosion at least one man had brought a rifle to bear Now as the wild rider darted past the hotel his hat was jerked from his head by an invisible hand He whirled again in the saddle and his guns raised As he turned Elizabeth Cornish saw something glint across the street It was the gleam of light on the barrel of a rifle that was thrust out through the window of the store That long line of light wobbled steadied and fire jetted from the mouth of the gun The black haired rider spilled sidewise out of the saddle his feet came clear of the stirrups and his right leg caught on the cantle He was flung rolling in the dust his arms flying weirdly The rifle disappeared from the window and a boy s set face looked out But before the limp body of the fugitive had stopped rolling Elizabeth Cornish dropped into a chair sick of face Her brother turned his back on the mob that closed over the dead man and looked at Elizabeth in alarm It was not the first time he had seen the result of a gunplay and for that matter it was not the first time for Elizabeth Her emotion upset him more than the roar of a hundred guns He managed to bring her a glass of water but she brushed it away so that half of the contents spilled on the red carpet of the room He isn t dead Vance He isn t dead she kept saying Dead before he left the saddle replied Vance with his usual calm And if the bullet hadn t finished him the fall would have broken his neck But what in the world Did you know the fellow He blinked at her his amazement growing The capable hands of Elizabeth were pressed to her breast and out of the thirty five years of spinsterhood which had starved her face he became aware of eyes young and dark and full of spirit by no means the keen quiet eyes of Elizabeth Cornish Do something she cried Go down and if they ve murdered him He literally fled from the room All the time she was seeing nothing but she would never forget what she had seen no matter how long she lived Subconsciously she was fighting to keep the street voices out of her mind They were saying things she did not wish to hear things she would not hear Finally she recovered enough to stand up and shut the window That brought her a terrible temptation to look down into the mass of men in the street and women too But she resisted and looked up The forms of the street remained obscurely in the bottom of her vision and made her think of something she had seen in the woods a colony of ants around a dead beetle Presently the door opened and Vance came back He still seemed very worried but she forced herself to smile at him and at once his concern disappeared it was plain that he had been troubled about her and not in the slightest by the fate of the strange rider She kept on smiling but for the first time in her life she really looked at Vance without sisterly prejudice in his favor She saw a good natured face handsome with the cheeks growing a bit blocky though Vance was only twenty five He had a glorious forehead and fine eyes but one would never look twice at Vance in a crowd She knew suddenly that her brother was simply a well mannered mediocrity Thank the Lord you re yourself again Elizabeth her brother said first of all I thought for a moment I don t know what Just the shock Vance she said Ordinarily she was well nigh brutally frank Now she found it easy to lie and keep on smiling It was such a horrible thing to see I suppose so Caught you off balance But I never knew you to lose your grip so easily Well do you know what you ve seen He s dead then He locked sharply at her It seemed to him that a tremor of unevenness had come into her voice Oh dead as a doornail Elizabeth Very neat shot Youngster that dropped him boy named Joe Minter Six thousand dollars for Joe Nice little nest egg to build a fortune on eh Six thousand dollars What do you mean Vance The price on the head of Jack Hollis That was Hollis sis The celebrated Black Jack But this is only a boy Vance He couldn t have been more than twenty five years old That s all But I ve heard of him for ten years very nearly And always as a man killer It can t be Black Jack I said the same thing but it s Black Jack well enough He started out when he was sixteen they say and he s been raising the devil ever since You should have seen them pick him up as if he were asleep and not dead What a body Lithe as a panther No larger than I am but they say he was a giant with his hands He was lighting his cigarette as he said this and consequently he did not see her eyes close tightly A moment later she was able to make her expression as calm as ever Came into town to see his baby went on Vance through the smoke Little year old beggar Think of the mother murmured Elizabeth Cornish I want to do something for her You can t replied her brother with unnecessary brutality Because she s dead A little after the youngster was born I believe Black Jack broke her heart and a very pleasant sort of girl she was they tell me What will become of the baby It will live and grow up he said carelessly They always do somehow Make another like his father I suppose A few years of fame in the mountain saloons and then a knife in the back The meager body of Elizabeth stiffened She was finding it less easy to maintain her nonchalant smile Why Why Blood will out like murder sis Nonsense All a matter of environment Have you ever read the story of the Jukes family An accident Take a son out of the best family in the world and raise him like a thief he ll be a thief And the thief s son can be raised to an honest manhood I know it She was seeing Black Jack as he had raced down the street with the black hair blowing about his face Of such stuff she felt the knights of another age had been made Vance was raising a forefinger in an authoritative way he had My dear before that baby is twenty five that was his father s age he ll have shot a man Bet you on it I ll take your bet The retort came with such a ring of her voice that he was startled Before he could recover she went on Go out and get that baby for me Vance I want it He tossed his cigarette out of the window Don t drop into one of your headstrong moods sis This is nonsense That s why I want to do it I m tired of playing the man I ve had enough to fill my mind I want something to fill my arms and my heart She drew up her hands with a peculiar gesture toward her shallow barren bosom and then her brother found himself silenced At the same time he was a little irritated for there was an imputation in her speech that she had been carrying the burden which his own shoulders should have supported Which was so true that he could not answer and therefore he cast about for some way of stinging her I thought you were going to escape the sentimental period Elizabeth But sooner or later I suppose a woman has to pass through it A spot of color came in her sallow cheek That s sufficiently disagreeable Vance A sense of his cowardice made him rise to conceal his confusion I m going to take you at your word sis I m going out to get that baby I suppose it can be bought like a calf He went deliberately to the door and laid his hand on the knob He had a rather vicious pleasure in calling her bluff but to his amazement she did not call him back He opened the door slowly Still she did not speak He slammed it behind him and stepped into the hall uproar n She could hear the uproar in the room His remarks threw the audience
