It was their last evening for the day before yesterday at the Mayor s office of Saint Jean de Luz he had with a hand trembling a little signed his engagement for three years in the Second naval infantry whose garrison was a military port of the North It was their last evening and they had said that they would make it longer than usual it would last till midnight Gracieuse had decided midnight which in the villages is an unseasonable and black hour an hour after which she did not know why all seemed to the little betrothed graver and guiltier In spite of the ardent desire of their senses the idea had not come to one nor to the other that during this last meeting under the oppression of parting something more might be attempted On the contrary at the instant so full of concentration of their farewell they felt more chaste still so eternal was their love Less prudent however since they had not to care for the morrow they dared to talk there on their lovers bench as they had never done before They talked of the future of a future which was for them very distant because at their age three years seem infinite In three years at his return she would be twenty then if her mother persisted to refuse in an absolute manner at the end of a year she would use her right of majority it was between them an agreed and a sworn thing The means of correspondence during the long absence of Ramuntcho preoccupied them a great deal between them everything was so complicated by obstacles and secrets Arrochkoa their only possible intermediary had promised his help but he was so changeable so uncertain Oh if he were to fail And then would he consent to send sealed letters If he did not consent there would be no pleasure in writing In our time when communications are easy and constant there are no more of these complete separations similar to the one which theirs would be they were to say to each other a very solemn farewell like the one which the lovers of other days said the lovers of the days when there were lands without post offices and distances that frightened one The fortunate time when they should see each other again appeared to them situated far off far off in the depths of duration yet because of the faith which they had in each other they expected this with a tranquil assurance as the faithful expect celestial life But the least things of their last evening acquired in their minds a singular importance as this farewell came near all grew and was exaggerated for them as happens in the expectation of death The slight sounds and the aspects of the night seemed to them particular and in spite of them were engraving themselves forever in their memory The song of the crickets had a characteristic which it seemed to them they had never heard before In the nocturnal sonority the barking of a watch dog coming from some distant farm made them shiver with a melancholy fright And Ramuntcho was to carry with him in his exile to preserve later with a desolate attachment a certain stem of grass plucked from the garden negligently and with which he had played unconsciously the whole evening A phase of their life finished with that day a lapse of time had occurred their childhood had passed Of recommendations they had none very long to exchange so intensely was each one sure of what the other might do during the separation They had less to say to each other than other engaged people have because they knew mutually their most intimate thoughts After the first hour of conversation they remained hand in hand in grave silence while were consumed the inexorable minutes of the end At midnight she wished him to go as she had decided in advance in her little thoughtful and obstinate head Therefore after having embraced each other for a long time they quitted each other as if the separation were at this precise minute an ineluctable thing which it was impossible to retard And while she returned to her room with sobs that he heard he scaled over the wall and in coming out of the darkness of the foliage found himself on the deserted road white with lunar rays At this first separation he suffered less than she because he was going because it was he that the morrow full of uncertainty awaited While he walked on the road powdered and clear the powerful charm of change of travel dulled his sensitiveness almost without any precise thought he looked at his shadow which the moon made clear and harsh marching in front of him And the great Gizune dominated impassibly everything with its cold and spectral air in all this white
