An article on Vanity Fair and Jane Eyre had appeared in the Quarterly Review of December Some weeks after Miss Bront wrote to her publishers asking why it had not been sent to her and conjecturing that it was unfavourable she repeated her previous request that whatever was done with the laudatory all critiques adverse to the novel might be forwarded to her without fail The Quarterly Review was accordingly sent I am not aware that Miss Bront took any greater notice of the article than to place a few sentences out of it in the mouth of a hard and vulgar woman in Shirley where they are so much in character that few have recognised them as a quotation The time when the article was read was good for Miss Bront she was numbed to all petty annoyances by the grand severity of Death Otherwise she might have felt more keenly than they deserved the criticisms which while striving to be severe failed in logic owing to the misuse of prepositions and have smarted under conjectures as to the authorship of Jane Eyre which intended to be acute were merely flippant But flippancy takes a graver name when directed against an author by an anonymous writer We call it then cowardly insolence Every one has a right to form his own conclusion respecting the merits and demerits of a book I complain not of the judgment which the reviewer passes on Jane Eyre Opinions as to its tendency varied then as they do now While I write I receive a letter from a clergyman in America in which he says We have in our sacred of sacreds a special shelf highly adorned as a place we delight to honour of novels which we recognise as having had a good influence on character OUR character Foremost is Jane Eyre Nor do I deny the existence of a diametrically opposite judgment And so as I trouble not myself about the reviewer s style of composition I leave his criticisms regarding the merits of the work on one side But when forgetting the chivalrous spirit of the good and noble Southey who said In reviewing anonymous works myself when I have known the authors I have never mentioned them taking it for granted they had sufficient reasons for avoiding the publicity the Quarterly reviewer goes on into gossiping conjectures as to who Currer Bell really is and pretends to decide on what the writer may be from the book I protest with my whole soul against such want of Christian charity Not even the desire to write a smart article which shall be talked about in London when the faint mask of the anonymous can be dropped at pleasure if the cleverness of the review be admired not even this temptation can excuse the stabbing cruelty of the judgment Who is he that should say of an unknown woman She must be one who for some sufficient reason has long forfeited the society of her sex Is he one who has led a wild and struggling and isolated life seeing few but plain and outspoken Northerns unskilled in the euphuisms which assist the polite world to skim over the mention of vice Has he striven through long weeping years to find excuses for the lapse of an only brother and through daily contact with a poor lost profligate been compelled into a certain familiarity with the vices that his soul abhors Has he through trials close following in dread march through his household sweeping the hearthstone bare of life and love still striven hard for strength to say It is the Lord let Him do what seemeth to Him good and sometimes striven in vain until the kindly Light returned If through all these dark waters the scornful reviewer have passed clear refined free from stain with a soul that has never in all its agonies cried lama sabachthani still even then let him pray with the Publican rather than judge with the Pharisee Jan th Anne had a very tolerable day yesterday and a pretty quiet night last night though she did not sleep much Mr Wheelhouse ordered the blister to be put on again She bore it without sickness I have just dressed it and she is risen and come down stairs She looks somewhat pale and sickly She has had one dose of the cod liver oil it smells and tastes like train oil I am trying to hope but the day is windy cloudy and stormy My spirits fall at intervals very low then I look where you counsel me to look beyond earthly tempests and sorrows I seem to get strength if not consolation It will not do to anticipate I feel that hourly In the night I awake and long for morning then my heart is wrung Papa continues much the same he was very faint when he came down to breakfast Dear E your friendship is some comfort to me I am thankful for it I see few lights through the darkness of the present time but amongst them the constancy of a kind heart attached to me is one of the most cheering and serene Jan th I can scarcely say that Anne is worse nor can I say she is better She varies often in the course of a day yet each day is passed pretty much the same The morning is usually the best time the afternoon and the evening the most feverish Her cough is the most troublesome at night but it is rarely violent The pain in her arm still disturbs her She takes the cod liver oil and carbonate of iron regularly she finds them both nauseous but especially the oil Her appetite is small indeed Do not fear that I shall relax in my care of her She is too precious not to be cherished with all the fostering strength I have Papa I am thankful to say has been a good deal better this last day or two As to your queries about myself I can only say that if I continue as I am I shall do very well I have not yet got rid of the pains in my chest and back They oddly return with every change of weather and are still sometimes accompanied with a little soreness and hoarseness but I combat them steadily with pitch plasters and bran tea I should think it silly and wrong indeed not to be regardful of my own health at present it would not do to be ill NOW I avoid looking forward or backward and try to keep looking upward This is not the time to regret dread or weep What I have and ought to do is very distinctly laid out for me what I want and pray for is strength to perform it The days pass in a slow dark march the nights are the test the sudden wakings from restless sleep the revived knowledge that one lies in her grave and another not at my side but in a separate and sick bed However God is over all Jan nd Anne really did seem to be a little better during some mild days last week but to day she looks very pale and languid again She perseveres with the cod liver oil but still finds it very nauseous She is truly obliged to you for the soles for her shoes and finds them extremely comfortable I am to commission you to get her just such a respirator as Mrs had She would not object to give a higher price if you thought it better If it is not too much trouble you may likewise get me a pair of soles you can send them and the respirator when you send the box You must put down the price of all and we will pay you in a Post Office order Wuthering Heights was given to you I have sent neither letter nor parcel I had nothing but dreary news to write so preferred that others should tell her I have not written to either I cannot write except when I am quite obliged Feb th We received the box and its contents quite safely to day The penwipers are very pretty and we are very much obliged to you for them I hope the respirator will be useful to Anne in case she should ever be well enough to go out again She continues very much in the same state I trust not greatly worse though she is becoming very thin I fear it would be only self delusion to fancy her better What effect the advancing season may have on her I know not perhaps the return of really warm weather may give nature a happy stimulus I tremble at the thought of any change to cold wind or frost Would that March were well over Her mind seems generally serene and her sufferings hitherto are nothing like Emily s The thought of what may be to come grows more familiar to my mind but it is a sad dreary guest March th We have found the past week a somewhat trying one it has not been cold but still there have been changes of temperature whose effect Anne has felt unfavourably She is not I trust seriously worse but her cough is at times very hard and painful and her strength rather diminished than improved I wish the month of March was well over You are right in conjecturing that I am somewhat depressed at times I certainly am It was almost easier to bear up when the trial was at its crisis than now The feeling of Emily s loss does not diminish as time wears on it often makes itself most acutely recognised It brings too an inexpressible sorrow with it and then the future is dark Yet I am well aware it will not do either to complain or sink and I strive to do neither Strength I hope and trust will yet be given in proportion to the burden but the pain of my position is not one likely to lessen with habit Its solitude and isolation are oppressive circumstances yet I do not wish for any friends to stay with me I could not do with any one not even you to share the sadness of the house it would rack me intolerably Meantime judgment is still blent with mercy Anne s sufferings still continue mild It is my nature when left alone to struggle on with a certain perseverance and I believe God will help me Anne had been delicate all her life a fact which perhaps made them less aware than they would otherwise have been of the true nature of those fatal first symptoms Yet they seem to have lost but little time before they sent for the first advice that could be procured She was examined with the stethoscope and the dreadful fact was announced that her lungs were affected and that tubercular consumption had already made considerable progress A system of treatment was prescribed which was afterwards ratified by the opinion of Dr Forbes For a short time they hoped that the disease was arrested Charlotte herself ill with a complaint that severely tried her spirits was the ever watchful nurse of this youngest last sister One comfort was that Anne was the patientest gentlest invalid that could be Still there were hours days weeks of inexpressible anguish to be borne under the pressure of which Charlotte could only pray and pray she did right earnestly Thus she writes on March th Anne s decline is gradual and fluctuating but its nature is not doubtful In spirit she is resigned at heart she is I believe a true Christian May God support her and all of us through the trial of lingering sickness and aid her in the last hour when the struggle which separates soul from body must be gone through We saw Emily torn from the midst of us when our hearts clung to her with intense attachment She was scarce buried when Anne s health failed These things would be too much if reason unsupported by religion were condemned to bear them alone I have cause to be most thankful for the strength that has hitherto been vouchsafed both to my father and to myself God I think is especially merciful to old age and for my own part trials which in perspective would have seemed to me quite intolerable when they actually came I endured without prostration Yet I must confess that in the time which has elapsed since Emily s death there have been moments of solitary deep inert affliction far harder to bear than those which immediately followed our loss The crisis of bereavement has an acute pang which goads to exertion the desolate after feeling sometimes paralyses I have learnt that we are not to find solace in our own strength we must seek it in God s omnipotence Fortitude is good but fortitude itself must be shaken under us to teach us how weak we are All through this illness of Anne s Charlotte had the comfort of being able to talk to her about her state a comfort rendered inexpressibly great by the contrast which it presented to the recollection of Emily s rejection of all sympathy If a proposal for Anne s benefit was made Charlotte could speak to her about it and the nursing and dying sister could consult with each other as to its desirability I have seen but one of Anne s letters it is the only time we seem to be brought into direct personal contact with this gentle patient girl In order to give the requisite preliminary explanation I must state that the family of friends to which E belonged proposed that Anne should come to them in order to try what change of air and diet and the company of kindly people could do towards restoring her to health In answer to this proposal Charlotte writes March th I read your kind note to Anne and she wishes me to thank you sincerely for your friendly proposal She feels of course that it would not do to take advantage of it by quartering an invalid upon the inhabitants of but she intimates there is another way in which you might serve her perhaps with some benefit to yourself as well as to her Should it a month or two hence be deemed advisable that she should go either to the sea side or to some inland watering place and should papa be disinclined to move and I consequently obliged to remain at home she asks could you be her companion Of course I need not add that in the event of such an arrangement being made you would be put to no expense This dear E is Anne s proposal I make it to comply with her wish but for my own part I must add that I see serious objections to your accepting it objections I cannot name to her She continues to vary is sometimes worse and sometimes better as the weather changes but on the whole I fear she loses strength Papa says her state is most precarious she may be spared for some time or a sudden alteration might remove her before we are aware Were such an alteration to take place while she was far from home and alone with you it would be terrible The idea of it distresses me inexpressibly and I tremble whenever she alludes to the project of a journey In short I wish we could gain time and see how she gets on If she leaves home it certainly should not be in the capricious month of May which is proverbially trying to the weak June would be a safer month If we could reach June I should have good hopes of her getting through the summer Write such an answer to this note as I can show Anne You can write any additional remarks to me on a separate piece of paper Do not consider yourself as confined to discussing only our sad affairs I am interested in all that interests you FROM ANNE BRONT April th My dear Miss I thank you greatly for your kind letter and your ready compliance with my proposal as far as the WILL can go at least I see however that your friends are unwilling that you should undertake the responsibility of accompanying me under present circumstances But I do not think there would be any great responsibility in the matter I know and everybody knows that you would be as kind and helpful as any one could possibly be and I hope I should not be very troublesome It would be as a companion not as a nurse that I should wish for your company otherwise I should not venture to ask it As for your kind and often repeated invitation to pray give my sincere thanks to your mother and sisters but tell them I could not think of inflicting my presence upon them as I now am It is very kind of them to make so light of the trouble but still there must be more or less and certainly no pleasure from the society of a silent invalid stranger I hope however that Charlotte will by some means make it possible to accompany me after all She is certainly very delicate and greatly needs a change of air and scene to renovate her constitution And then your going with me before the end of May is apparently out of the question unless you are disappointed in your visitors but I should be reluctant to wait till then if the weather would at all permit an earlier departure You say May is a trying month and so say others The earlier part is often cold enough I acknowledge but according to my experience we are almost certain of some fine warm days in the latter half when the laburnums and lilacs are in bloom whereas June is often cold and July generally wet But I have a more serious reason than this for my impatience of delay The doctors say that change of air or removal to a better climate would hardly ever fail of success in consumptive cases if the remedy were taken IN TIME but the reason why there are so many disappointments is that it is generally deferred till it is too late Now I would not commit this error and to say the truth though I suffer much less from pain and fever than I did when you were with us I am decidedly weaker and very much thinner My cough still troubles me a good deal especially in the night and what seems worse than all I am subject to great shortness of breath on going up stairs or any slight exertion Under these circumstances I think there is no time to be lost I have no horror of death if I thought it inevitable I think I could quietly resign myself to the prospect in the hope that you dear Miss would give as much of your company as you possibly could to Charlotte and be a sister to her in my stead But I wish it would please God to spare me not only for papa s and Charlotte s sakes but because I long to do some good in the world before I leave it I have many schemes in my head for future practice humble and limited indeed but still I should not like them all to come to nothing and myself to have lived to so little purpose But God s will be done Remember me respectfully to your mother and sisters and believe me dear Miss yours most affectionately ANNE BRONT It must have been about this time that Anne composed her last verses before the desk was closed and the pen laid aside for ever I I hoped that with the brave and strong My portioned task might lie To toil amid the busy throng With purpose pure and high II But God has fixed another part And He has fixed it well I said so with my bleeding heart When first the anguish fell III Thou God hast taken our delight Our treasured hope away Thou bid st us now weep through the night And sorrow through the day IV These weary hours will not be lost These days of misery These nights of darkness anguish tost Can I but turn to Thee IV With secret labour to sustain In humble patience every blow To gather fortitude from pain And hope and holiness from woe VI Thus let me serve Thee from my heart Whate er may be my written fate Whether thus early to depart Or yet a while to wait VII If Thou should st bring me back to life More humbled I should be More wise more strengthened for the strife More apt to lean on Thee VIII Should death be standing at the gate Thus should I keep my vow But Lord whatever be my fate Oh let me serve Thee now I take Charlotte s own words as the best record of her thoughts and feelings during all this terrible time April th I read Anne s letter to you it was touching enough as you say If there were no hope beyond this world no eternity no life to come Emily s fate and that which threatens Anne would be heart breaking I cannot forget Emily s death day it becomes a more fixed a darker a more frequently recurring idea in my mind than ever It was very terrible She was torn conscious panting reluctant though resolute out of a happy life But it WILL NOT do to dwell on these things I am glad your friends object to your going with Anne it would never do To speak truth even if your mother and sisters had consented I never could It is not that there is any laborious attention to pay her she requires and will accept but little nursing but there would be hazard and anxiety of mind beyond what you ought to be subject to If a month or six weeks hence she continues to wish for a change as much as she does now I shall D V go with her myself It will certainly be my paramount duty other cares must be made subservient to that I have consulted Mr T he does not object and recommends Scarborough which was Anne s own choice I trust affairs may be so ordered that you may be able to be with us at least part of the time Whether in lodgings or not I should wish to be boarded Providing oneself is I think an insupportable nuisance I don t like keeping provisions in a cupboard locking up being pillaged and all that It is a petty wearing annoyance The progress of Anne s illness was slower than that of Emily s had been and she was too unselfish to refuse trying means from which if she herself had little hope of benefit her friends might hereafter derive a mournful satisfaction I began to flatter myself she was getting strength But the change to frost has told upon her she suffers more of late Still her illness has none of the fearful rapid symptoms which appalled in Emily s case Could she only get over the spring I hope summer may do much for her and then early removal to a warmer locality for the winter might at least prolong her life Could we only reckon upon another year I should be thankful but can we do this for the healthy A few days ago I wrote to have Dr Forbes opinion He warned us against entertaining sanguine hopes of recovery The cod liver oil he considers a peculiarly efficacious medicine He too disapproved of change of residence for the present There is some feeble consolation in thinking we are doing the very best that can be done The agony of forced total neglect is not now felt as during Emily s illness Never may we be doomed to feel such agony again It was terrible I have felt much less of the disagreeable pains in my chest lately and much less also of the soreness and hoarseness I tried an application of hot vinegar which seemed to do good May st I was glad to hear that when we go to Scarborough you will be at liberty to go with us but the journey and its consequences still continue a source of great anxiety to me I must try to put it off two or three weeks longer if I can perhaps by that time the milder season may have given Anne more strength perhaps it will be otherwise I cannot tell The change to fine weather has not proved beneficial to her so far She has sometimes been so weak and suffered so much from pain in the side during the last few days that I have not known what to think She may rally again and be much better but there must be SOME improvement before I can feel justified in taking her away from home Yet to delay is painful for as is ALWAYS the case I believe under her circumstances she seems herself not half conscious of the necessity for such delay She wonders I believe why I don t talk more about the journey it grieves me to think she may even be hurt by my seeming tardiness She is very much emaciated far more than when you were with us her arms are no thicker than a little child s The least exertion brings a shortness of breath She goes out a little every day but we creep rather than walk Papa continues pretty well I hope I shall be enabled to bear up So far I have reason for thankfulness to God May had come and brought the milder weather longed for but Anne was worse for the very change A little later on it became colder and she rallied and poor Charlotte began to hope that if May were once over she might last for a long time Miss Bront wrote to engage the lodgings at Scarborough a place which Anne had formerly visited with the family to whom she was governess They took a good sized sitting room and an airy double bedded room both commanding a sea view in one of the best situations of the town Money was as nothing in comparison with life besides Anne had a small legacy left to her by her godmother and they felt that she could not better employ this than in obtaining what might prolong life if not restore health On May th Charlotte writes It is with a heavy heart I prepare and earnestly do I wish the fatigue of the journey were well over It may be borne better than I expect for temporary stimulus often does much but when I see the daily increasing weakness I know not what to think I fear you will be shocked when you see Anne but be on your guard dear E not to express your feelings indeed I can trust both your self possession and your kindness I wish my judgment sanctioned the step of going to Scarborough more fully than it does You ask how I have arranged about leaving Papa I could make no special arrangement He wishes me to go with Anne and would not hear of Mr N s coming or anything of that kind so I do what I believe is for the best and leave the result to Providence They planned to rest and spend a night at York and at Anne s desire arranged to make some purchases there Charlotte ends the letter to her friend in which she tells her all this with May rd I wish it seemed less like a dreary mockery in us to talk of buying bonnets etc Anne was very ill yesterday She had difficulty of breathing all day even when sitting perfectly still To day she seems better again I long for the moment to come when the experiment of the sea air will be tried Will it do her good I cannot tell I can only wish Oh if it would please God to strengthen and revive Anne how happy we might be together His will however be done The two sisters left Haworth on Thursday May th They were to have done so the day before and had made an appointment with their friend to meet them at the Leeds Station in order that they might all proceed together But on Wednesday morning Anne was so ill that it was impossible for the sisters to set out yet they had no means of letting their friend know of this and she consequently arrived at Leeds station at the time specified There she sate waiting for several hours It struck her as strange at the time and it almost seems ominous to her fancy now that twice over from two separate arrivals on the line by which she was expecting her friends coffins were carried forth and placed in hearses which were in waiting for their dead as she was waiting for one in four days to become so The next day she could bear suspense no longer and set out for Haworth reaching there just in time to carry the feeble fainting invalid into the chaise which stood at the gate to take them down to Keighley The servant who stood at the Parsonage gates saw Death written on her face and spoke of it Charlotte saw it and did not speak of it it would have been giving the dread too distinct a form and if this last darling yearned for the change to Scarborough go she should however Charlotte s heart might be wrung by impending fear The lady who accompanied them Charlotte s beloved friend of more than twenty years has kindly written out for me the following account of the journey and of the end She left her home May th died May th Her life was calm quiet spiritual SUCH was her end Through the trials and fatigues of the journey she evinced the pious courage and fortitude of a martyr Dependence and helplessness were ever with her a far sorer trial than hard racking pain The first stage of our journey was to York and here the dear invalid was so revived so cheerful and so happy we drew consolation and trusted that at least temporary improvement was to be derived from the change which SHE had so longed for and her friends had so dreaded for her By her request we went to the Minster and to her it was an overpowering pleasure not for its own imposing and impressive grandeur only but because it brought to her susceptible nature a vital and overwhelming sense of omnipotence She said while gazing at the structure If finite power can do this what is the and here emotion stayed her speech and she was hastened to a less exciting scene Her weakness of body was great but her gratitude for every mercy was greater After such an exertion as walking to her bed room she would clasp her hands and raise her eyes in silent thanks and she did this not to the exclusion of wonted prayer for that too was performed on bended knee ere she accepted the rest of her couch On the th we arrived at Scarborough our dear invalid having during the journey directed our attention to every prospect worthy of notice On the th she drove on the sands for an hour and lest the poor donkey should be urged by its driver to a greater speed than her tender heart thought right she took the reins and drove herself When joined by her friend she was charging the boy master of the donkey to treat the poor animal well She was ever fond of dumb things and would give up her own comfort for them On Sunday the th she wished to go to church and her eye brightened with the thought of once more worshipping her God amongst her fellow creatures We thought it prudent to dissuade her from the attempt though it was evident her heart was longing to join in the public act of devotion and praise She walked a little in the afternoon and meeting with a sheltered and comfortable seat near the beach she begged we would leave her and enjoy the various scenes near at hand which were new to us but familiar to her She loved the place and wished us to share her preference The evening closed in with the most glorious sunset ever witnessed The castle on the cliff stood in proud glory gilded by the rays of the declining sun The distant ships glittered like burnished gold the little boats near the beach heaved on the ebbing tide inviting occupants The view was grand beyond description Anne was drawn in her easy chair to the window to enjoy the scene with us Her face became illumined almost as much as the glorious scene she gazed upon Little was said for it was plain that her thoughts were driven by the imposing view before her to penetrate forwards to the regions of unfading glory She again thought of public worship and wished us to leave her and join those who were assembled at the House of God We declined gently urging the duty and pleasure of staying with her who was now so dear and so feeble On returning to her place near the fire she conversed with her sister upon the propriety of returning to their home She did not wish it for her own sake she said she was fearing others might suffer more if her decease occurred where she was She probably thought the task of accompanying her lifeless remains on a long journey was more than her sister could bear more than the bereaved father could bear were she borne home another and a third tenant of the family vault in the short space of nine months The night was passed without any apparent accession of illness She rose at seven o clock and performed most of her toilet herself by her expressed wish Her sister always yielded such points believing it was the truest kindness not to press inability when it was not acknowledged Nothing occurred to excite alarm till about A M She then spoke of feeling a change She believed she had not long to live Could she reach home alive if we prepared immediately for departure A physician was sent for Her address to him was made with perfect composure She begged him to say how long he thought she might live not to fear speaking the truth for she was not afraid to die The doctor reluctantly admitted that the angel of death was already arrived and that life was ebbing fast She thanked him for his truthfulness and he departed to come again very soon She still occupied her easy chair looking so serene so reliant there was no opening for grief as yet though all knew the separation was at hand She clasped her hands and reverently invoked a blessing from on high first upon her sister then upon her friend to whom she said Be a sister in my stead Give Charlotte as much of your company as you can She then thanked each for her kindness and attention Ere long the restlessness of approaching death appeared and she was borne to the sofa on being asked if she were easier she looked gratefully at her questioner and said It is not YOU who can give me ease but soon all will be well through the merits of our Redeemer Shortly after this seeing that her sister could hardly restrain her grief she said Take courage Charlotte take courage Her faith never failed and her eye never dimmed till about two o clock when she calmly and without a sigh passed from the temporal to the eternal So still and so hallowed were her last hours and moments There was no thought of assistance or of dread The doctor came and went two or three times The hostess knew that death was near yet so little was the house disturbed by the presence of the dying and the sorrow of those so nearly bereaved that dinner was announced as ready through the half opened door as the living sister was closing the eyes of the dead one She could now no more stay the welled up grief of her sister with her emphatic and dying Take courage and it burst forth in brief but agonising strength Charlotte s affection however had another channel and there it turned in thought in care and in tenderness There was bereavement but there was not solitude sympathy was at hand and it was accepted With calmness came the consideration of the removal of the dear remains to their home resting place This melancholy task however was never performed for the afflicted sister decided to lay the flower in the place where it had fallen She believed that to do so would accord with the wishes of the departed She had no preference for place She thought not of the grave for that is but the body s goal but of all that is beyond it Her remains rest Where the south sun warms the now dear sod Where the ocean billows lave and strike the steep and turf covered rock Anne died on the Monday On the Tuesday Charlotte wrote to her father but knowing that his presence was required for some annual Church solemnity at Haworth she informed him that she had made all necessary arrangements for the interment and that the funeral would take place so soon that he could hardly arrive in time for it The surgeon who had visited Anne on the day of her death offered his attendance but it was respectfully declined Mr Bront wrote to urge Charlotte s longer stay at the seaside Her health and spirits were sorely shaken and much as he naturally longed to see his only remaining child he felt it right to persuade her to take with her friend a few more weeks change of scene though even that could not bring change of thought Late in June the friends returned homewards parting rather suddenly it would seem from each other when their paths diverged July I intended to have written a line to you to day if I had not received yours We did indeed part suddenly it made my heart ache that we were severed without the time to exchange a word and yet perhaps it was better I got here a little before eight o clock All was clean and bright waiting for me Papa and the servants were well and all received me with an affection which should have consoled The dogs seemed in strange ecstasy I am certain they regarded me as the harbinger of others The dumb creatures thought that as I was returned those who had been so long absent were not far behind I left Papa soon and went into the dining room I shut the door I tried to be glad that I was come home I have always been glad before except once even then I was cheered But this time joy was not to be the sensation I felt that the house was all silent the rooms were all empty I remembered where the three were laid in what narrow dark dwellings never more to reappear on earth So the sense of desolation and bitterness took possession of me The agony that WAS to be undergone and WAS NOT to be avoided came on I underwent it and passed a dreary evening and night and a mournful morrow to day I am better I do not know how life will pass but I certainly do feel confidence in Him who has upheld me hitherto Solitude may be cheered and made endurable beyond what I can believe The great trial is when evening closes and night approaches At that hour we used to assemble in the dining room we used to talk Now I sit by myself necessarily I am silent I cannot help thinking of their last days remembering their sufferings and what they said and did and how they looked in mortal affliction Perhaps all this will become less poignant in time Let me thank you once more dear E for your kindness to me which I do not mean to forget How did you think all looking at your home Papa thought me a little stronger he said my eyes were not so sunken July th I do not much like giving an account of myself I like better to go out of myself and talk of something more cheerful My cold wherever I got it whether at Easton or elsewhere is not vanished yet It began in my head then I had a sore throat and then a sore chest with a cough but only a trifling cough which I still have at times The pain between my shoulders likewise amazed me much Say nothing about it for I confess I am too much disposed to be nervous This nervousness is a horrid phantom I dare communicate no ailment to Papa his anxiety harasses me inexpressibly My life is what I expected it to be Sometimes when I wake in the morning and know that Solitude Remembrance and Longing are to be almost my sole companions all day through that at night I shall go to bed with them that they will long keep me sleepless that next morning I shall wake to them again sometimes Nell I have a heavy heart of it But crushed I am not yet nor robbed of elasticity nor of hope nor quite of endeavour I have some strength to fight the battle of life I am aware and can acknowledge I have many comforts many mercies Still I can GET ON But I do hope and pray that never may you or any one I love be placed as I am To sit in a lonely room the clock ticking loud through a still house and have open before the mind s eye the record of the last year with its shocks sufferings losses is a trial I write to you freely because I believe you will hear me with moderation that you will not
