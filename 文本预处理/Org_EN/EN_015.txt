The next year opened with a spell of cold dreary weather which told severely on a constitution already tried by anxiety and care Miss Bront describes herself as having utterly lost her appetite and as looking grey old worn and sunk from her sufferings during the inclement season The cold brought on severe toothache toothache was the cause of a succession of restless miserable nights and long wakefulness told acutely upon her nerves making them feel with redoubled sensitiveness all the harass of her oppressive life Yet she would not allow herself to lay her bad health to the charge of an uneasy mind for after all said she at this time I have many many things to be thankful for But the real state of things may be gathered from the following extracts from her letters March st Even at the risk of appearing very exacting I can t help saying that I should like a letter as long as your last every time you write Short notes give one the feeling of a very small piece of a very good thing to eat they set the appetite on edge and don t satisfy it a letter leaves you more contented and yet after all I am very glad to get notes so don t think when you are pinched for time and materials that it is useless to write a few lines be assured a few lines are very acceptable as far as they go and though I like long letters I would by no means have you to make a task of writing them I really should like you to come to Haworth before I again go to B And it is natural and right that I should have this wish To keep friendship in proper order the balance of good offices must be preserved otherwise a disquieting and anxious feeling creeps in and destroys mutual comfort In summer and in fine weather your visit here might be much better managed than in winter We could go out more be more independent of the house and of our room Branwell has been conducting himself very badly lately I expect from the extravagance of his behaviour and from mysterious hints he drops for he never will speak out plainly that we shall be hearing news of fresh debts contracted by him soon My health is better I lay the blame of its feebleness on the cold weather more than on an uneasy mind March th It is at Haworth if all be well that we must next see each other again I owe you a grudge for giving Miss M some very exaggerated account about my not being well and setting her on to urge my leaving home as quite a duty I ll take care not to tell you next time when I think I am looking specially old and ugly as if people could not have that privilege without being supposed to be at the last gasp I shall be thirty one next birthday My youth is gone like a dream and very little use have I ever made of it What have I done these last thirty years Precious little The quiet sad year stole on The sisters were contemplating near at hand and for a long time the terrible effects of talents misused and faculties abused in the person of that brother once their fond darling and dearest pride They had to cheer the poor old father into whose heart all trials sank the deeper because of the silent stoicism of his endurance They had to watch over his health of which whatever was its state he seldom complained They had to save as much as they could the precious remnants of his sight They had to order the frugal household with increased care so as to supply wants and expenditure utterly foreign to their self denying natures Though they shrank from overmuch contact with their fellow beings for all whom they met they had kind words if few and when kind actions were needed they were not spared if the sisters at the parsonage could render them They visited the parish schools duly and often were Charlotte s rare and brief holidays of a visit from home shortened by her sense of the necessity of being in her place at the Sunday school In the intervals of such a life as this Jane Eyre was making progress The Professor was passing slowly and heavily from publisher to publisher Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey had been accepted by another publisher on terms somewhat impoverishing to the two authors a bargain to be alluded to more fully hereafter It was lying in his hands awaiting his pleasure for its passage through the press during all the months of early summer The piece of external brightness to which the sisters looked during these same summer months was the hope that the friend to whom so many of Charlotte s letters are addressed and who was her chosen companion whenever circumstances permitted them to be together as well as a favourite with Emily and Anne would be able to pay them a visit at Haworth Fine weather had come in May Charlotte writes and they hoped to make their visitor decently comfortable Their brother was tolerably well having got to the end of a considerable sum of money which he became possessed of in the spring and therefore under the wholesome restriction of poverty But Charlotte warns her friend that she must expect to find a change in his appearance and that he is broken in mind and ends her note of entreating invitation by saying I pray for fine weather that we may get out while you stay At length the day was fixed Friday will suit us very well I DO trust nothing will now arise to prevent your coming I shall be anxious about the weather on that day if it rains I shall cry Don t expect me to meet you where would be the good of it I neither like to meet nor to be met Unless indeed you had a box or a basket for me to carry then there would be some sense in it Come in black blue pink white or scarlet as you like Come shabby or smart neither the colour nor the condition signifies provided only the dress contain E all will be right But there came the first of a series of disappointments to be borne One feels how sharp it must have been to have wrung out the following words May th Your letter of yesterday did indeed give me a cruel chill of disappointment I cannot blame you for I know it was not your fault I do not altogether exempt from reproach This is bitter but I feel bitter As to going to B I will not go near the place till you have been to Haworth My respects to all and sundry accompanied with a large amount of wormwood and gall from the effusion of which you and your mother are alone excepted C B You are quite at liberty to tell what I think if you judge proper Though it is true I may be somewhat unjust for I am deeply annoyed I thought I had arranged your visit tolerably comfortable for you this time I may find it more difficult on another occasion I must give one sentence from a letter written about this time as it shows distinctly the clear strong sense of the writer I was amused by what she says respecting her wish that when she marries her husband will at least have a will of his own even should he be a tyrant Tell her when she forms that aspiration again she must make it conditional if her husband has a strong will he must also have strong sense a kind heart and a thoroughly correct notion of justice because a man with a WEAK BRAIN and a STRONG WILL is merely an intractable brute you can have no hold of him you can never lead him right A TYRANT under any circumstances is a curse Meanwhile The Professor had met with many refusals from different publishers some I have reason to believe not over courteously worded in writing to an unknown author and none alleging any distinct reasons for its rejection Courtesy is always due but it is perhaps hardly to be expected that in the press of business in a great publishing house they should find time to explain why they decline particular works Yet though one course of action is not to be wondered at the opposite may fall upon a grieved and disappointed mind with all the graciousness of dew and I can well sympathise with the published account which Currer Bell gives of the feelings experienced on reading Messrs Smith and Elder s letter containing the rejection of The Professor As a forlorn hope we tried one publishing house more Ere long in a much shorter space than that on which experience had taught him to calculate there came a letter which he opened in the dreary anticipation of finding two hard hopeless lines intimating that Messrs Smith and Elder were not disposed to publish the MS and instead he took out of the envelope a letter of two pages He read it trembling It declined indeed to publish that tale for business reasons but it discussed its merits and demerits so courteously so considerately in a spirit so rational with a discrimination so enlightened that this very refusal cheered the author better than a vulgarly expressed acceptance would have done It was added that a work in three volumes would meet with careful attention Mr Smith has told me a little circumstance connected with the reception of this manuscript which seems to me indicative of no ordinary character It came accompanied by the note given below in a brown paper parcel to Cornhill Besides the address to Messrs Smith and Co there were on it those of other publishers to whom the tale had been sent not obliterated but simply scored through so that Messrs Smith at once perceived the names of some of the houses in the trade to which the unlucky parcel had gone without success To MESSRS SMITH AND ELDER July th Gentlemen I beg to submit to your consideration the accompanying manuscript I should be glad to learn whether it be such as you approve and would undertake to publish at as early a period as possible Address Mr Currer Bell under cover to Miss Bront Haworth Bradford Yorkshire Some time elapsed before an answer was returned A little circumstance may be mentioned here though it belongs to a somewhat earlier period as showing Miss Bront s inexperience of the ways of the world and willing deference to the opinion of others She had written to a publisher about one of her manuscripts which she had sent him and not receiving any reply she consulted her brother as to what could be the reason for the prolonged silence He at once set it down to her not having enclosed a postage stamp in her letter She accordingly wrote again to repair her former omission and apologise for it To MESSRS SMITH AND ELDER August nd Gentlemen About three weeks since I sent for your consideration a MS entitled The Professor a tale by Currer Bell I should be glad to know whether it reached your hands safely and likewise to learn at your earliest convenience whether it be such as you can undertake to publish I am gentlemen yours respectfully CURRER BELL I enclose a directed cover for your reply This time her note met with a prompt answer for four days later she writes in reply to the letter which she afterwards characterised in the Preface to the second edition of Wuthering Heights as containing a refusal so delicate reasonable and courteous as to be more cheering than some acceptances Your objection to the want of varied interest in the tale is I am aware not without grounds yet it appears to me that it might be published without serious risk if its appearance were speedily followed up by another work from the same pen of a more striking and exciting character The first work might serve as an introduction and accustom the public to the author s the success of the second might thereby be rendered more probable I have a second narrative in three volumes now in progress and nearly completed to which I have endeavoured to impart a more vivid interest than belongs to The Professor In about a month I hope to finish it so that if a publisher were found for The Professor the second narrative might follow as soon as was deemed advisable and thus the interest of the public if any interest was aroused might not be suffered to cool Will you be kind enough to favour me with your judgment on this plan While the minds of the three sisters were in this state of suspense their long expected friend came to pay her promised visit She was with them at the beginning of the glowing August of that year They were out on the moors for the greater part of the day basking in the golden sunshine which was bringing on an unusual plenteousness of harvest for which somewhat later Charlotte expressed her earnest desire that there should be a thanksgiving service in all the churches August was the season of glory for the neighbourhood of Haworth Even the smoke lying in the valley between that village and Keighley took beauty from the radiant colours on the moors above the rich purple of the heather bloom calling out an harmonious contrast in the tawny golden light that in the full heat of summer evenings comes stealing everywhere through the dun atmosphere of the hollows And up on the moors turning away from all habitations of men the royal ground on which they stood would expand into long swells of amethyst tinted hills melting away into aerial tints and the fresh and fragrant scent of the heather and the murmur of innumerable bees would lend a poignancy to the relish with which they welcomed their friend to their own true home on the wild and open hills There too they could escape from the Shadow in the house below Throughout this time during all these confidences not a word was uttered to their friend of the three tales in London two accepted and in the press one trembling in the balance of a publisher s judgment nor did she hear of that other story nearly completed lying in manuscript in the grey old parsonage down below She might have her suspicions that they all wrote with an intention of publication some time but she knew the bounds which they set to themselves in their communications nor could she nor can any one else wonder at their reticence when remembering how scheme after scheme had failed just as it seemed close upon accomplishment Mr Bront too had his suspicions of something going on but never being spoken to he did not speak on the subject and consequently his ideas were vague and uncertain only just prophetic enough to keep him from being actually stunned when later on he heard of the success of Jane Eyre to the progress of which we must now return To MESSRS SMITH AND ELDER August th I now send you per rail a MS entitled Jane Eyre a novel in three volumes by Currer Bell I find I cannot prepay the carriage of the parcel as money for that purpose is not received at the small station house where it is left If when you acknowledge the receipt of the MS you would have the goodness to mention the amount charged on delivery I will immediately transmit it in postage stamps It is better in future to address Mr Currer Bell under cover to Miss Bront Haworth Bradford Yorkshire as there is a risk of letters otherwise directed not reaching me at present To save trouble I enclose an envelope Jane Eyre was accepted and printed and published by October th While it was in the press Miss Bront went to pay a short visit to her friend at B The proofs were forwarded to her there and she occasionally sat at the same table with her friend correcting them but they did not exchange a word on the subject Immediately on her return to the Parsonage she wrote September I had a very wet windy walk home from Keighley but my fatigue quite disappeared when I reached home and found all well Thank God for it My boxes came safe this morning I have distributed the presents Papa says I am to remember him most kindly to you The screen will be very useful and he thanks you for it Tabby was charmed with her cap She said she never thought o naught o t sort as Miss sending her aught and she is sure she can never thank her enough for it I was infuriated on finding a jar in my trunk At first I hoped it was empty but when I found it heavy and replete I could have hurled it all the way back to B However the inscription A B softened me much It was at once kind and villainous in you to send it You ought first to be tenderly kissed and then afterwards as tenderly whipped Emily is just now on the floor of the bed room where I am writing looking at her apples She smiled when I gave the collar to her as your present with an expression at once well pleased and slightly surprised All send their love Yours in a mixture of anger and love When the manuscript of Jane Eyre had been received by the future publishers of that remarkable novel it fell to the share of a gentleman connected with the firm to read it first He was so powerfully struck by the character of the tale that he reported his impression in very strong terms to Mr Smith who appears to have been much amused by the admiration excited You seem to have been so enchanted that I do not know how to believe you he laughingly said But when a second reader in the person of a clear headed Scotchman not given to enthusiasm had taken the MS home in the evening and became so deeply interested in it as to sit up half the night to finish it Mr Smith s curiosity was sufficiently excited to prompt him to read it for himself and great as were the praises which had been bestowed upon it he found that they had not exceeded the truth On its publication copies were presented to a few private literary friends Their discernment had been rightly reckoned upon They were of considerable standing in the world of letters and one and all returned expressions of high praise along with their thanks for the book Among them was the great writer of fiction for whom Miss Bront felt so strong an admiration he immediately appreciated and in a characteristic note to the publishers acknowledged its extraordinary merits The Reviews were more tardy or more cautious The Athenaeum and the Spectator gave short notices containing qualified admissions of the power of the author The Literary Gazette was uncertain as to whether it was safe to praise an unknown author The Daily News declined accepting the copy which had been sent on the score of a rule never to review novels but a little later on there appeared a notice of the Bachelor of the Albany in that paper and Messrs Smith and Elder again forwarded a copy of Jane Eyre to the Editor with a request for a notice This time the work was accepted but I am not aware what was the character of the article upon it The Examiner came forward to the rescue as far as the opinions of professional critics were concerned The literary articles in that paper were always remarkable for their genial and generous appreciation of merit nor was the notice of Jane Eyre an exception it was full of hearty yet delicate and discriminating praise Otherwise the press in general did little to promote the sale of the novel the demand for it among librarians had begun before the appearance of the review in the Examiner the power of fascination of the tale itself made its merits known to the public without the kindly finger posts of professional criticism and early in December the rush began for copies I will insert two or three of Miss Bront s letters to her publishers in order to show how timidly the idea of success was received by one so unaccustomed to adopt a sanguine view of any subject in which she was individually concerned The occasions on which these notes were written will explain themselves Oct th Gentlemen The six copies of Jane Eyre reached me this morning You have given the work every advantage which good paper clear type and a seemly outside can supply if it fails the fault will lie with the author you are exempt I now await the judgment of the press and the public I am Gentlemen yours respectfully C BELL MESSRS SMITH ELDER AND CO Oct th Gentlemen I have received the newspapers They speak quite as favourably of Jane Eyre as I expected them to do The notice in the Literary Gazette seems certainly to have been indited in rather a flat mood and the Athenaeum has a style of its own which I respect but cannot exactly relish still when one considers that journals of that standing have a dignity to maintain which would be deranged by a too cordial recognition of the claims of an obscure author I suppose there is every reason to be satisfied Meantime a brisk sale would be effectual support under the hauteur of lofty critics I am Gentlemen yours respectfully C BELL MESSRS SMITH ELDER AND CO Nov th Gentlemen I have to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the th inst and to thank you for the information it communicates The notice from the People s Journal also duly reached me and this morning I received the Spectator The critique in the Spectator gives that view of the book which will naturally be taken by a certain class of minds I shall expect it to be followed by other notices of a similar nature The way to detraction has been pointed out and will probably be pursued Most future notices will in all likelihood have a reflection of the Spectator in them I fear this turn of opinion will not improve the demand for the book but time will show If Jane Eyre has any solid worth in it it ought to weather a gust of unfavourable wind I am Gentlemen yours respectfully C BELL MESSRS SMITH ELDER AND CO Nov th Gentlemen I have received the Economist but not the Examiner from some cause that paper has missed as the Spectator did on a former occasion I am glad however to learn through your letter that its notice of Jane Eyre was favourable and also that the prospects of the work appear to improve I am obliged to you for the information respecting Wuthering Heights I am Gentlemen yours respectfully C BELL To MESSRS SMITH ELDER AND CO Dec st Gentlemen The Examiner reached me to day it had been missent on account of the direction which was to Currer Bell care of Miss Bront Allow me to intimate that it would be better in future not to put the name of Currer Bell on the outside of communications if directed simply to Miss Bront they will be more likely to reach their destination safely Currer Bell is not known in the district and I have no wish that he should become known The notice in the Examiner gratified me very much it appears to be from the pen of an able man who has understood what he undertakes to criticise of course approbation from such a quarter is encouraging to an author and I trust it will prove beneficial to the work I am Gentlemen yours respectfully C BELL I received likewise seven other notices from provincial papers enclosed in an envelope I thank you very sincerely for so punctually sending me all the various criticisms on Jane Eyre TO MESSRS SMITH ELDER AND CO Dec th Gentlemen I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter inclosing a bank post bill for which I thank you Having already expressed my sense of your kind and upright conduct I can now only say that I trust you will always have reason to be as well content with me as I am with you If the result of any future exertions I may be able to make should prove agreeable and advantageous to you I shall be well satisfied and it would be a serious source of regret to me if I thought you ever had reason to repent being my publishers You need not apologise Gentlemen for having written to me so seldom of course I am always glad to hear from you but I am truly glad to hear from Mr Williams likewise he was my first favourable critic he first gave me encouragement to persevere as an author consequently I naturally respect him and feel grateful to him Excuse the informality of my letter and believe me Gentlemen yours respectfully CURRER BELL There is little record remaining of the manner in which the first news of its wonderful success reached and affected the one heart of the three sisters I once asked Charlotte we were talking about the description of Lowood school and she was saying that she was not sure whether she should have written it if she had been aware how instantaneously it would have been identified with Cowan Bridge whether the popularity to which the novel attained had taken her by surprise She hesitated a little and then said I believed that what had impressed me so forcibly when I wrote it must make a strong impression on any one who read it I was not surprised at those who read Jane Eyre being deeply interested in it but I hardly expected that a book by an unknown author could find readers The sisters had kept the knowledge of their literary ventures from their father fearing to increase their own anxieties and disappointment by witnessing his for he took an acute interest in all that befell his children and his own tendency had been towards literature in the days when he was young and hopeful It was true he did not much manifest his feelings in words he would have thought that he was prepared for disappointment as the lot of man and that he could have met it with stoicism but words are poor and tardy interpreters of feelings to those who love one another and his daughters knew how he would have borne ill success worse for them than for himself So they did not tell him what they were undertaking He says now that he suspected it all along but his suspicions could take no exact form as all he was certain of was that his children were perpetually writing and not writing letters We have seen how the communications from their publishers were received under cover to Miss Bront Once Charlotte told me they overheard the postman meeting Mr Bront as the latter was leaving the house and inquiring from the parson where one Currer Bell could be living to which Mr Bront replied that there was no such person in the parish This must have been the misadventure to which Miss Bront alludes in the beginning of her correspondence with Mr Aylott Now however when the demand for the work had assured success to Jane Eyre her sisters urged Charlotte to tell their father of its publication She accordingly went into his study one afternoon after his early dinner carrying with her a copy of the book and one or two reviews taking care to include a notice adverse to it She informed me that something like the following conversation took place between her and him I wrote down her words the day after I heard them and I am pretty sure they are quite accurate Papa I ve been writing a book Have you my dear Yes and I want you to read it I am afraid it will try my eyes too much But it is not in manuscript it is printed My dear you ve never thought of the expense it will be It will be almost sure to be a loss for how can you get a book sold No one knows you or your name But papa I don t think it will be a loss no more will you if you will just let me read you a review or two and tell you more about it So she sate down and read some of the reviews to her father and then giving him the copy of Jane Eyre that she intended for him she left him to read it When he came in to tea he said Girls do you know Charlotte has been writing a book and it is much better than likely But while the existence of Currer Bell the author was like a piece of a dream to the quiet inhabitants of Haworth Parsonage who went on with their uniform household life their cares for their brother being its only variety the whole reading world of England was in a ferment to discover the unknown author Even the publishers of Jane Eyre were ignorant whether Currer Bell was a real or an assumed name whether it belonged to a man or a woman In every town people sought out the list of their friends and acquaintances and turned away in disappointment No one they knew had genius enough to be the author Every little incident mentioned in the book was turned this way and that to answer if possible the much vexed question of sex All in vain People were content to relax their exertions to satisfy their curiosity and simply to sit down and greatly admire I am not going to write an analysis of a book with which every one who reads this biography is sure to be acquainted much less a criticism upon a work which the great flood of public opinion has lifted up from the obscurity in which it first appeared and laid high and safe on the everlasting hills of fame Before me lies a packet of extracts from newspapers and periodicals which Mr Bront has sent me It is touching to look them over and see how there is hardly any notice however short and clumsily worded in any obscure provincial paper but what has been cut out and carefully ticketed with its date by the poor bereaved father so proud when he first read them so desolate now For one and all are full of praise of this great unknown genius which suddenly appeared amongst us Conjecture as to the authorship ran about like wild fire People in London smooth and polished as the Athenians of old and like them spending their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing were astonished and delighted to find that a fresh sensation a new pleasure was in reserve for them in the uprising of an author capable of depicting with accurate and Titanic power the strong self reliant racy and individual characters which were not after all extinct species but lingered still in existence in the North They thought that there was some exaggeration mixed with the peculiar force of delineation Those nearer to the spot where the scene of the story was apparently laid were sure from the very truth and accuracy of the writing that the writer was no Southeron for though dark and cold and rugged is the North the old strength of the Scandinavian races yet abides there and glowed out in every character depicted in Jane Eyre Farther than this curiosity both honourable and dishonourable was at fault When the second edition appeared in the January of the following year with the dedication to Mr Thackeray people looked at each other and wondered afresh But Currer Bell knew no more of William Makepeace Thackeray as an individual man of his life age fortunes or circumstances than she did of those of Mr Michael Angelo Titmarsh The one had placed his name as author upon the title page of Vanity Fair the other had not She was thankful for the opportunity of expressing her high admiration of a writer whom as she says she regarded as the social regenerator of his day as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped state of things His wit is bright his humour attractive but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet lightning playing under the edge of the summer cloud does to the electric death spark hid in its womb Anne Bront had been more than usually delicate all the summer and her sensitive spirit had been deeply affected by the great anxiety of her home But now that Jane Eyre gave such indications of success Charlotte began to plan schemes of future pleasure perhaps relaxation from care would be the more correct expression for their darling younger sister the little one of the household But although Anne was cheered for a time by Charlotte s success the fact was that neither her spirits nor her bodily strength were such as to incline her to much active exertion and she led far too sedentary a life continually stooping either over her book or work or at her desk It is with difficulty writes her sister that we can prevail upon her to take a walk or induce her to converse I look forward to next summer with the confident intention that she shall if possible make at least a brief sojourn at the sea side In this same letter is a sentence telling how dearly home even with its present terrible drawback lay at the roots of her heart but it is too much blended with reference to the affairs of others to bear quotation Any author of a successful novel is liable to an inroad of letters from unknown readers containing commendation sometimes of so fulsome and indiscriminating a character as to remind the recipient of Dr Johnson s famous speech to one who offered presumptuous and injudicious praise sometimes saying merely a few words which have power to stir the heart as with the sound of a trumpet and in the high humility they excite to call forth strong resolutions to make all future efforts worthy of such praise and occasionally containing that true appreciation of both merits and demerits together with the sources of each which forms the very criticism and help for which an inexperienced writer thirsts Of each of these kinds of communication Currer Bell received her full share and her warm heart and true sense and high standard of what she aimed at affixed to each its true value Among other letters of hers some to Mr G H Lewes have been kindly placed by him at my service and as I know Miss Bront highly prized his letters of encouragement and advice I shall give extracts from her replies as their dates occur because they will indicate the kind of criticism she valued and also because throughout in anger as in agreement and harmony they show her character unblinded by any self flattery full of clear sighted modesty as to what she really did well and what she failed in grateful for friendly interest and only sore and irritable when the question of sex in authorship was as she thought roughly or unfairly treated As to the rest the letters speak for themselves to those who know how to listen far better than I can interpret their meaning into my poorer and weaker words Mr Lewes has politely sent me the following explanation of that letter of his to which the succeeding one of Miss Bront is a reply When Jane Eyre first appeared the publishers courteously sent me a copy The enthusiasm with which I read it made me go down to Mr Parker and propose to write a review of it for Frazer s Magazine He would not consent to an unknown novel for the papers had not yet declared themselves receiving such importance but thought it might make one on Recent Novels English and French which appeared in Frazer December Meanwhile I had written to Miss Bront to tell her the delight with which her book filled me and seem to have sermonised her to judge from her reply To G H LEWES ESQ Nov th Dear Sir Your letter reached me yesterday I beg to assure you that I appreciate fully the intention with which it was written and I thank you sincerely both for its cheering commendation and valuable advice You warn me to beware of melodrama and you exhort me to adhere to the real When I first began to write so impressed was I with the truth of the principles you advocate that I determined to take Nature and Truth as my sole guides and to follow in their very footprints I restrained imagination eschewed romance repressed excitement over bright colouring too I avoided and sought to produce something which should be soft grave and true My work a tale in one volume being completed I offered it to a publisher He said it was original faithful to nature but he did not feel warranted in accepting it such a work would not sell I tried six publishers in succession they all told me it was deficient in startling incident and thrilling excitement that it would never suit the circulating libraries and as it was on those libraries the success of works of fiction mainly depended they could not undertake to publish what would be overlooked there Jane Eyre was rather objected to at first on the same grounds but finally found acceptance I mention this to you not with a view of pleading exemption from censure but in order to direct your attention to the root of certain literary evils If in your forthcoming article in Frazer you would bestow a few words of enlightenment on the public who support the circulating libraries you might with your powers do some good You advise me too not to stray far from the ground of experience as I become weak when I enter the region of fiction and you say real experience is perennially interesting and to all men I feel that this also is true but dear Sir is not the real experience of each individual very limited And if a writer dwells upon that solely or principally is he not in danger of repeating himself and also of becoming an egotist Then too imagination is a strong restless faculty which claims to be heard and exercised are we to be quite deaf to her cry and insensate to her struggles When she shows us bright pictures are we never to look at them and try to reproduce them And when she is eloquent and speaks rapidly and urgently in our ear are we not to write to her dictation I shall anxiously search the next number of Fraser for your opinions on these points Believe me dear Sir yours gratefully C BELL But while gratified by appreciation as an author she was cautious as to the person from whom she received it for much of the value of the praise depended on the sincerity and capability of the person rendering it Accordingly she applied to Mr Williams a gentleman connected with her publishers firm for information as to who and what Mr Lewes was Her reply after she had learnt something of the character of her future critic and while awaiting his criticism must not be omitted Besides the reference to him it contains some amusing allusions to the perplexity which began to be excited respecting the identity of the brothers Bell and some notice of the conduct of another publisher towards her sister which I refrain from characterising because I understand that truth is considered a libel in speaking of such people To W S WILLIAMS ESQ Nov th Dear Sir I have received the Britannia and the Sun but not the Spectator which I rather regret as censure though not pleasant is often wholesome Thank you for your information regarding Mr Lewes I am glad to hear that he is a clever and sincere man such being the case I can await his critical sentence with fortitude even if it goes against me I shall not murmur ability and honesty have a right to condemn where they think condemnation is deserved From what you say however I trust rather to obtain at least a modified approval Your account of the various surmises respecting the identity of the brothers Bell amused me much were the enigma solved it would probably be found not worth the trouble of solution but I will let it alone it suits ourselves to remain quiet and certainly injures no one else The reviewer who noticed the little book of poems in the Dublin Magazine conjectured that the soi disant three personages were in reality but one who endowed with an unduly prominent organ of self esteem and consequently impressed with a somewhat weighty notion of his own merits thought them too vast to be concentrated in a single individual and accordingly divided himself into three out of consideration I suppose for the nerves of the much to be astounded public This was an ingenious thought in the reviewer very original and striking but not accurate We are three A prose work by Ellis and Acton will soon appear it should have been out indeed long since for the first proof sheets were already in the press at the commencement of last August before Currer Bell had placed the MS of Jane Eyre in your hands Mr however does not do business like Messrs Smith and Elder a different spirit seems to preside at Street to that which guides the helm at Cornhill My relations have suffered from exhausting delay and procrastination while I have to acknowledge the benefits of a management at once business like and gentleman like energetic and considerate I should like to know if Mr often acts as he has done to my relations or whether this is an exceptional instance of his method Do you know and can you tell me anything about him You must excuse me for going to the point at once when I want to learn anything if my questions are importunate you are of course at liberty to decline answering them I am yours respectfully C BELL To G H LEWES ESQ Nov nd Dear Sir I have now read Ranthorpe I could not get it till a day or two ago but I have got it and read it at last and in reading Ranthorpe I have read a new book not a reprint not a reflection of any other book but a NEW BOOK I did not know such books were written now It is very different to any of the popular works of fiction it fills the mind with fresh knowledge Your experience and your convictions are made the reader s and to an author at least they have a value and an interest quite unusual I await your criticism on Jane Eyre now with other sentiments than I entertained before the perusal of Ranthorpe You were a stranger to me I did not particularly respect you I did not feel that your praise or blame would have any special weight I knew little of your right to condemn or approve NOW I am informed on these points You will be severe your last letter taught me as much Well I shall try to extract good out of your severity and besides though I am now sure you are a just discriminating man yet being mortal you must be fallible and if any part of your censure galls me too keenly to the quick gives me deadly pain I shall for the present disbelieve it and put it quite aside till such time as I feel able to receive it without torture I am dear Sir yours very respectfully C BELL In December Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey appeared The first named of these stories has revolted many readers by the power with which wicked and exceptional characters are depicted Others again have felt the attraction of remarkable genius even when displayed on grim and terrible criminals Miss Bront herself says with regard to this tale Where delineation of human character is concerned the case is different I am bound to avow that she had scarcely more practical knowledge of the peasantry amongst whom she lived than a nun has of the country people that pass her convent gates My sister s disposition was not naturally gregarious circumstances favoured and fostered her tendency to seclusion except to go to church or take a walk on the hills she rarely crossed the threshold of home Though the feeling for the people around her was benevolent intercourse with them she never sought nor with very few exceptions ever experienced and yet she knew them knew their ways their language and their family histories she could hear of them with interest and talk of them with detail minute graphic and accurate but WITH them she rarely exchanged a word Hence it ensued that what her mind has gathered of the real concerning them was too exclusively confined to those tragic and terrible traits of which in listening to the secret annals of every rude vicinage the memory is sometimes compelled to receive the impress Her imagination which was a spirit more sombre than sunny more powerful than sportive found in such traits material whence it wrought creations like Heathcliff like Earnshaw like Catherine Having formed these beings she did not know what she had done If the auditor of her work when read in manuscript shuddered under the grinding influence of natures so relentless and implacable of spirits so lost and fallen if it was complained that the mere hearing of certain vivid and fearful scenes banished sleep by night and disturbed mental peace by day Ellis Bell would wonder what was meant and suspect the complainant of affectation Had she but lived her mind would of itself have grown like a strong tree loftier straighter wider spreading and its matured fruits would have attained a mellower ripeness and sunnier bloom but on that mind time and experience alone could work to the influence of other intellects she was not amenable Whether justly or unjustly the productions of the two younger Miss Bront s were not received with much favour at the time of their publication Critics failed to do them justice The immature but very real powers revealed in Wuthering Heights were scarcely recognised its import and nature were misunderstood the identity of its author was misrepresented it was said that this was an earlier and ruder attempt of the same pen which had produced Jane Eyre Unjust and grievous error We laughed at it at first but I deeply lament it now Henceforward Charlotte Bront s existence becomes divided into two parallel currents her life as Currer Bell the author her life as Charlotte Bront the woman There were separate duties belonging to each character not opposing each other not impossible but difficult to be reconciled When a man becomes an author it is probably merely a change of employment to him He takes a portion of that time which has hitherto been devoted to some other study or pursuit he gives up something of the legal or medical profession in which he has hitherto endeavoured to serve others or relinquishes part of the trade or business by which he has been striving to gain a livelihood and another merchant or lawyer or doctor steps into his vacant place and probably does as well as he But no other can take up the quiet regular duties of the daughter the wife or the mother as well as she whom God has appointed to fill that particular place a woman s principal work in life is hardly left to her own choice nor can she drop the domestic charges devolving on her as an individual for the exercise of the most splendid talents that were ever bestowed And yet she must not shrink from the extra responsibility implied by the very fact of her possessing such talents She must not hide her gift in a napkin it was meant for the use and service of others In an humble and faithful spirit must she labour to do what is not impossible or God would not have set her to do it I put into words what Charlotte Bront put into actions The year opened with sad domestic distress It is necessary however painful to remind the reader constantly of what was always present to the hearts of father and sisters at this time It is well that the thoughtless critics who spoke of the sad and gloomy views of life presented by the Bront s in their tales should know how such words were wrung out of them by the living recollection of the long agony they suffered It is well too that they who have objected to the representation of coarseness and shrank from it with repugnance as if such conceptions arose out of the writers should learn that not from the imagination not from internal conception but from the hard cruel facts pressed down by external life upon their very senses for long months and years together did they write out what they saw obeying the stern dictates of their consciences They might be mistaken They might err in writing at all when their affections were so great that they could not write otherwise than they did of life It is possible that it would have been better to have described only good and pleasant people doing only good and pleasant things in which case they could hardly have written at any time all I say is that never I believe did women possessed of such wonderful gifts exercise them with a fuller feeling of responsibility for their use As to mistakes stand now as authors as well as women before the judgment seat of God Jan th We have not been very comfortable here at home lately Branwell has by some means contrived to get more money from the old quarter and has led us a sad life Papa is harassed day and night we have little peace he is always sick has two or three times fallen down in fits what will be the ultimate end God knows But who is without their drawback their scourge their skeleton behind the curtain It remains only to do one s best and endure with patience what God sends I suppose that she had read Mr Lewes review on Recent Novels when it appeared in the December of the last year but I find no allusion to it till she writes to him on January th Dear Sir I thank you then sincerely for your generous review and it is with the sense of double content I express my gratitude because I am now sure the tribute is not superfluous or obtrusive You were not severe on Jane Eyre you were very lenient I am glad you told me my faults plainly in private for in your public notice you touch on them so lightly I should perhaps have passed them over thus indicated with too little reflection I mean to observe your warning about being careful how I undertake new works my stock of materials is not abundant but very slender and besides neither my experience my acquirements nor my powers are sufficiently varied to justify my ever becoming a frequent writer I tell you this because your article in Frazer left in me an uneasy impression that you were disposed to think better of the author of Jane Eyre than that individual deserved and I would rather you had a correct than a flattering opinion of me even though I should never see you If I ever DO write another book I think I will have nothing of what you call melodrama I think so but I am not sure I THINK too I will endeavour to follow the counsel which shines out of Miss Austen s mild eyes to finish more and be more subdued but neither am I sure of that When authors write best or at least when they write most fluently an influence seems to waken in them which becomes their master which will have its own way putting out of view all behests but its own dictating certain words and insisting on their being used whether vehement or measured in their nature new moulding characters giving unthought of turns to incidents rejecting carefully elaborated old ideas and suddenly creating and adopting new ones Is it not so And should we try to counteract this influence Can we indeed counteract it I am glad that another work of yours will soon appear most curious shall I be to see whether you will write up to your own principles and work out your own theories You did not do it altogether in Ranthorpe at least not in the latter part but the first portion was I think nearly without fault then it had a pith truth significance in it which gave the book sterling value but to write so one must have seen and known a great deal and I have seen and known very little Why do you like Miss Austen so very much I am puzzled on that point What induced you to say that you would have rather written Pride and Prejudice or Tom Jones than any of the Waverley Novels I had not seen Pride and Prejudice till I read that sentence of yours and then I got the book And what did I find An accurate daguerreotyped portrait of a commonplace face a carefully fenced highly cultivated garden with neat borders and delicate flowers but no glance of a bright vivid physiognomy no open country no fresh air no blue hill no bonny beck I should hardly like to live with her ladies and gentlemen in their elegant but confined houses These observations will probably irritate you but I shall run the risk Now I can understand admiration of George Sand for though I never saw any of her works which I admired throughout even Consuelo which is the best or the best that I have read appears to me to couple strange extravagance with wondrous excellence yet she has a grasp of mind which if I cannot fully comprehend I can very deeply respect she is sagacious and profound Miss Austen is only shrewd and observant Am I wrong or were you hasty in what you said If you have time I should be glad to hear further on this subject if not or if you think the questions frivolous do not trouble yourself to reply I am yours respectfully C BELL To G H LEWES ESQ Jan th Dear Sir I must write one more note though I had not intended to trouble you again so soon I have to agree with you and to differ from you You correct my crude remarks on the subject of the influence well I accept your definition of what the effects of that influence should be I recognise the wisdom of your rules for its regulation What a strange lecture comes next in your letter You say I must familiarise my mind with the fact that Miss Austen is not a poetess has no sentiment you scornfully enclose the word in inverted commas no eloquence none of the ravishing enthusiasm of poetry and then you add I MUST learn to acknowledge her as ONE OF THE GREATEST ARTISTS OF THE GREATEST PAINTERS OF HUMAN CHARACTER and one of the writers with the nicest sense of means to an end that ever lived The last point only will I ever acknowledge Can there be a great artist without poetry What I call what I will bend to as a great artist then cannot be destitute of the divine gift But by POETRY I am sure you understand something different to what I do as you do by sentiment It is POETRY as I comprehend the word which elevates that masculine George Sand and makes out of something coarse something Godlike It is sentiment in my sense of the term sentiment jealously hidden but genuine which extracts the venom from that formidable Thackeray and converts what might be corrosive poison into purifying elixir If Thackeray did not cherish in his large heart deep feeling for his kind he would delight to exterminate as it is I believe he wishes only to reform Miss Austen being as you say without sentiment without Poetry maybe IS sensible real more REAL than TRUE but she cannot be great I submit to your anger which I have now excited for have I not questioned the perfection of your darling the storm may pass over me Nevertheless I will when I can I do not know when that will be as I have no access to a circulating library diligently peruse all Miss Austen s works as you recommend You must forgive me for not always being able to think as you do and still believe me yours gratefully C BELL I have hesitated a little before inserting the following extract from a letter to Mr Williams but it is strikingly characteristic and the criticism contained in it is from that circumstance so interesting whether we agree with it or not that I have determined to do so though I thereby displace the chronological order of the letters in order to complete this portion of a correspondence which is very valuable as showing the purely intellectual side of her character To W S WILLIAMS BSQ April th My dear Sir I have now read Rose Blanche and Violet and I will tell you as well as I can what I think of it Whether it is an improvement on Ranthorpe I do not know for I liked Ranthorpe much but at any rate it contains more of a good thing I find in it the same power but more fully developed The author s character is seen in every page which makes the book interesting far more interesting than any story could do but it is what the writer himself says that attracts far more than what he puts into the mouths of his characters G H Lewes is to my perception decidedly the most original character in the book The didactic passages seem to me the best far the best in the work very acute very profound are some of the views there given and very clearly they are offered to the reader He is a just thinker he is a sagacious observer there is wisdom in his theory and I doubt not energy in his practice But why then are you often provoked with him while you read How does he manage while teaching to make his hearer feel as if his business was not quietly to receive the doctrines propounded but to combat them You acknowledge that he offers you gems of pure truth why do you keep perpetually scrutinising them for flaws Mr Lewes I divine with all his talents and honesty must have some faults of manner there must be a touch too much of dogmatism a dash extra of confidence in him sometimes This you think while you are reading the book but when you have closed it and laid it down and sat a few minutes collecting your thoughts and settling your impressions you find the idea or feeling predominant in your mind to be pleasure at the fuller acquaintance you have made with a fine mind and a true heart with high abilities and manly principles I hope he will not be long ere he publishes another book His emotional scenes are somewhat too uniformly vehement would not a more subdued style of treatment often have produced a more masterly effect Now and then Mr Lewes takes a French pen into his hand wherein he differs from Mr Thackeray who always uses an English quill However the French pen does not far mislead Mr Lewes he wields it with British muscles All honour to him for the excellent general tendency of his book He gives no charming picture of London literary society and especially the female part of it but all coteries whether they be literary scientific political or religious must it seems to me have a tendency to change truth into affectation When people belong to a clique they must I suppose in some measure write talk think and live for that clique a harassing and narrowing necessity I trust the press and the public show themselves disposed to give the book the reception it merits and that is a very cordial one far beyond anything due to a Bulwer or D Israeli production Let us return from Currer Bell to Charlotte Bront The winter in Haworth had been a sickly season Influenza had prevailed amongst the villagers and where there was a real need for the presence of the clergyman s daughters they were never found wanting although they were shy of bestowing mere social visits on the parishioners They had themselves suffered from the epidemic Anne severely as in her case it had been attended with cough and fever enough to make her elder sisters very anxious about her There is no doubt that the proximity of the crowded church yard rendered the Parsonage unhealthy and occasioned much illness to its inmates Mr Bront represented the unsanitary state at Haworth pretty forcibly to the Board of Health and after the requisite visits from their officers obtained a recommendation that all future interments in the churchyard should be forbidden a new graveyard opened on the hill side and means set on foot for obtaining a water supply to each house instead of the weary hard worked housewives having to carry every bucketful from a distance of several hundred yards up a steep street But he was baffled by the rate payers as in many a similar instance quantity carried it against quality numbers against intelligence And thus we find that illness often assumed a low typhoid form in Haworth and fevers of various kinds visited the place with sad frequency In February Louis Philippe was dethroned The quick succession of events at that time called forth the following expression of Miss Bront s thoughts on the subject in a letter addressed to Miss Wooler and dated March st I remember well wishing my lot had been cast in the troubled times of the late war and seeing in its exciting incidents a kind of stimulating charm which it made my pulses beat fast to think of I remember even I think being a little impatient that you would not fully sympathise with my feelings on those subjects that you heard my aspirations and speculations very tranquilly and by no means seemed to think the flaming swords could be any pleasant addition to Paradise I have now out lived youth and though I dare not say that I have outlived all its illusions that the romance is quite gone from life the veil fallen from truth and that I see both in naked reality yet certainly many things are not what they were ten years ago and amongst the rest the pomp and circumstance of war have quite lost in my eyes their fictitious glitter I have still no doubt that the shock of moral earthquakes wakens a vivid sense of life both in nations and individuals that the fear of dangers on a broad national scale diverts men s minds momentarily from brooding over small private perils and for the time gives them something like largeness of views but as little doubt have I that convulsive revolutions put back the world in all that is good check civilisation bring the dregs of society to its surface in short it appears to me that insurrections and battles are the acute diseases of nations and that their tendency is to exhaust by their violence the vital energies of the countries where they occur That England may be spared the spasms cramps and frenzy fits now contorting the Continent and threatening Ireland I earnestly pray With the French and Irish I have no sympathy With the Germans and Italians I think the case is different as different as the love of freedom is from the lust for license Her birthday came round She wrote to the friend whose birthday was within a week of hers wrote the accustomed letter but reading it with our knowledge of what she had done we perceive the difference between her thoughts and what they were a year or two ago when she said I have done nothing There must have been a modest consciousness of having done something present in her mind as she wrote this year I am now thirty two Youth is gone gone and will never come back can t help it It seems to me that sorrow must come some time to everybody and those who scarcely taste it in their youth often have a more brimming and bitter cup to drain in after life whereas those who exhaust the dregs early who drink the lees before the wine may reasonably hope for more palatable draughts to succeed The authorship of Jane Eyre was as yet a close secret in the Bront family not even this friend who was all but a sister knew more about it than the rest of the world She might conjecture it is true both from her knowledge of previous habits and from the suspicious fact of the proofs having been corrected at B that some literary project was afoot but she knew nothing and wisely said nothing until she heard a report from others that Charlotte Bront was an author had published a novel Then she wrote to her and received the two following letters confirmatory enough as it seems to me now in their very vehemence and agitation of intended denial of the truth of the report April th Write another letter and explain that last note of yours distinctly If your allusions are to myself which I suppose they are understand this I have given no one a right to gossip about me and am not to be judged by frivolous conjectures emanating from any quarter whatever Let me know what you heard and from whom you heard it May rd All I can say to you about a certain matter is this the report if report there be and if the lady who seems to have been rather mystified had not dreamt what she fancied had been told to her must have had its origin in some absurd misunderstanding I have given NO ONE a right either to affirm or to hint in the most distant manner that I was publishing humbug Whoever has said it if any one has which I doubt is no friend of mine Though twenty books were ascribed to me I should own none I scout the idea utterly Whoever after I have distinctly rejected the charge urges it upon me will do an unkind and an ill bred thing The most profound obscurity is infinitely preferable to vulgar notoriety and that notoriety I neither seek nor will have If then any B an or G an should presume to bore you on the subject to ask you what novel Miss Bront has been publishing you can just say with the distinct firmness of which you are perfect mistress when you choose that you are authorised by Miss Bront to say that she repels and disowns every accusation of the kind You may add if you please that if any one has her confidence you believe you have and she has made no drivelling confessions to you on the subject I am at a loss to conjecture from what source this rumour has come and I fear it has far from a friendly origin I am not certain however and I should be very glad if I could gain certainty Should you hear anything more please let me know Your offer of Simeon s Life is a very kind one and I thank you for it I dare say Papa would like to see the work very much as he knew Mr Simeon Laugh or scold A out of the publishing notion and believe me through all chances and changes whether calumniated or let alone Yours faithfully C BRONT The reason why Miss Bront was so anxious to preserve her secret was I am told that she had pledged her word to her sisters that it should not be revealed through her The dilemmas attendant on the publication of the sisters novels under assumed names were increasing upon them Many critics insisted on believing that all the fictions published as by three Bells were the works of one author but written at different periods of his development and maturity No doubt this suspicion affected the reception of the books Ever since the completion of Anne Bront s tale of Agnes Grey she had been labouring at a second The Tenant of Wildfell Hall It is little known the subject the deterioration of a character whose profligacy and ruin took their rise in habits of intemperance so slight as to be only considered good fellowship was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas She had says her sister of that gentle little one in the course of her life been called on to contemplate near at hand and for a long time the terrible effects of talents misused and faculties abused hers was naturally a sensitive reserved and dejected nature what she saw sunk very deeply into her mind it did her harm She brooded over it till she believed it to be a duty to reproduce every detail of course with fictitious characters incidents and situations as a warning to others She hated her work but would pursue it When reasoned with on the subject she regarded such reasonings as a temptation to self indulgence She must be honest she must not varnish soften or conceal This well meant resolution brought on her misconstruction and some abuse which she bore as it was her custom to bear whatever was unpleasant with mild steady patience She was a very sincere and practical Christian but the tinge of religious melancholy communicated a sad shade to her brief blameless life In the June of this year The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was sufficiently near its completion to be submitted to the person who had previously published for Ellis and Acton Bell In consequence of his mode of doing business considerable annoyance was occasioned both to Miss Bront and to them The circumstances as detailed in a letter of hers to a friend in New Zealand were these One morning at the beginning of July a communication was received at the Parsonage from Messrs Smith and Elder which disturbed its quiet inmates not a little as though the matter brought under their notice was merely referred to as one which affected their literary reputation they conceived it to have a bearing likewise upon their character Jane Eyre had had a great run in America and a publisher there had consequently bid high for early sheets of the next work by Currer Bell These Messrs Smith and Elder had promised to let him have He was therefore greatly astonished and not well pleased to learn that a similar agreement had been entered into with another American house and that the new tale was very shortly to appear It turned out upon inquiry that the mistake had originated in Acton and Ellis Bell s publisher having assured this American house that to the best of his belief Jane Eyre Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall which he pronounced superior to either of the other two were all written by the same author Though Messrs Smith and Elder distinctly stated in their letter that they did not share in such belief the sisters were impatient till they had shown its utter groundlessness and set themselves perfectly straight With rapid decision they resolved that Charlotte and Anne should start for London that very day in order to prove their separate identity to Messrs Smith and Elder and demand from the credulous publisher his reasons for a belief so directly at variance with an assurance which had several times been given to him Having arrived at this determination they made their preparations with resolute promptness There were many household duties to be performed that day but they were all got through The two sisters each packed up a change of dress in a small box which they sent down to Keighley by an opportune cart and after early tea they set off to walk thither no doubt in some excitement for independently of the cause of their going to London it was Anne s first visit there A great thunderstorm overtook them on their way that summer evening to the station but they had no time to seek shelter They only just caught the train at Keighley arrived at Leeds and were whirled up by the night train to London About eight o clock on the Saturday morning they arrived at the Chapter Coffee house Paternoster Row a strange place but they did not well know where else to go They refreshed themselves by washing and had some breakfast Then they sat still for a few minutes to consider what next should be done When they had been discussing their project in the quiet of Haworth Parsonage the day before and planning the mode of setting about the business on which they were going to London they had resolved to take a cab if they should find it desirable from their inn to Cornhill but that amidst the bustle and queer state of inward excitement in which they found themselves as they sat and considered their position on the Saturday morning they quite forgot even the possibility of hiring a conveyance and when they set forth they became so dismayed by the crowded streets and the impeded crossings that they stood still repeatedly in complete despair of making progress and were nearly an hour in walking the half mile they had to go Neither Mr Smith nor Mr Williams knew that they were coming they were entirely unknown to the publishers of Jane Eyre who were not in fact aware whether the Bells were men or women but had always written to them as to men On reaching Mr Smith s Charlotte put his own letter into his hands the same letter which had excited so much disturbance at Haworth Parsonage only twenty four hours before Where did you get this said he as if he could not believe that the two young ladies dressed in black of slight figures and diminutive stature looking pleased yet agitated could be the embodied Currer and Acton Bell for whom curiosity had been hunting so eagerly in vain An explanation ensued and Mr Smith at once began to form plans for their amusement and pleasure during their stay in London He urged them to meet a few literary friends at his house and this was a strong temptation to Charlotte as amongst them were one or two of the writers whom she particularly wished to see but her resolution to remain unknown induced her firmly to put it aside The sisters were equally persevering in declining Mr Smith s invitations to stay at his house They refused to leave their quarters saying they were not prepared for a long stay When they returned back to their inn poor Charlotte paid for the excitement of the interview which had wound up the agitation and hurry of the last twenty four hours by a racking headache and harassing sickness Towards evening as she rather expected some of the ladies of Mr Smith s family to call she prepared herself for the chance by taking a strong dose of sal volatile which roused her a little but still as she says she was in grievous bodily case when their visitors were announced in full evening costume The sisters had not understood that it had been settled that they were to go to the Opera and therefore were not ready Moreover they had no fine elegant dresses either with them or in the world But Miss Bront resolved to raise no objections in the acceptance of kindness So in spite of headache and weariness they made haste to dress themselves in their plain high made country garments Charlotte says in an account which she gives to her friend of this visit to London describing the entrance of her party into the Opera house Fine ladies and gentlemen glanced at us as we stood by the box door which was not yet opened with a slight graceful superciliousness quite warranted by the circumstances Still I felt pleasurably excited in spite of headache sickness and conscious clownishness and I saw Anne was calm and gentle which she always is The performance was Rossini s Barber of Seville very brilliant though I fancy there are things I should like better We got home after one o clock We had never been in bed the night before had been in constant excitement for twenty four hours you may imagine we were tired The next day Sunday Mr Williams came early to take us to church and in the afternoon Mr Smith and his mother fetched us in a carriage and took us to his house to dine On Monday we went to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy the National Gallery dined again at Mr Smith s and then went home to tea with Mr Williams at his house On Tuesday morning we left London laden with books Mr Smith had given us and got safely home A more jaded wretch than I looked it would be difficult to conceive I was thin when I went but I was meagre indeed when I returned my face looking grey and very old with strange deep lines ploughed in it my eyes stared unnaturally I was weak and yet restless In a while however these bad effects of excitement went off and I regained my normal condition The impression Miss Bront made upon those with whom she first became acquainted during this visit to London was of a person with clear judgment and fine sense and though reserved possessing unconsciously the power of drawing out others in conversation She never expressed an opinion without assigning a reason for it she never put a question without a definite purpose and yet people felt at their ease in talking with her All conversation with her was genuine and stimulating and when she launched forth in praise or reprobation of books or deeds or works of art her eloquence was indeed burning She was thorough in all that she said or did yet so open and fair in dealing with a subject or contending with an opponent that instead of rousing resentment she merely convinced her hearers of her earnest zeal for the truth and right Not the least singular part of their proceedings was the place at which the sisters had chosen to stay Paternoster Row was for many years sacred to publishers It is a narrow flagged street lying under the shadow of St Paul s at each end there are posts placed so as to prevent the passage of carriages and thus preserve a solemn silence for the deliberations of the Fathers of the Row The dull warehouses on each side are mostly occupied at present by wholesale stationers if they be publishers shops they show no attractive front to the dark and narrow street Half way up on the left hand side is the Chapter Coffee house I visited it last June It was then unoccupied It had the appearance of a dwelling house two hundred years old or so such as one sometimes sees in ancient country towns the ceilings of the small rooms were low and had heavy beams running across them the walls were wainscotted breast high the staircase was shallow broad and dark taking up much space in the centre of the house This then was the Chapter Coffee house which a century ago was the resort of all the booksellers and publishers and where the literary hacks the critics and even the wits used to go in search of ideas or employment This was the place about which Chatterton wrote in those delusive letters he sent to his mother at Bristol while he was starving in London I am quite familiar at the Chapter Coffee house and know all the geniuses there Here he heard of chances of employment here his letters were to be left Years later it became the tavern frequented by university men and country clergymen who were up in London for a few days and having no private friends or access into society were glad to learn what was going on in the world of letters from the conversation which they were sure to hear in the Coffee room In Mr Bront s few and brief visits to town during his residence at Cambridge and the period of his curacy in Essex he had stayed at this house hither he had brought his daughters when he was convoying them to Brussels and here they came now from very ignorance where else to go It was a place solely frequented by men I believe there was but one female servant in the house Few people slept there some of the stated meetings of the Trade were held in it as they had been for more than a century and occasionally country booksellers with now and then a clergyman resorted to it but it was a strange desolate place for the Miss Bront s to have gone to from its purely business and masculine aspect The old grey haired elderly man who officiated as waiter seems to have been touched from the very first with the quiet simplicity of the two ladies and he tried to make them feel comfortable and at home in the long low dingy room up stairs where the meetings of the Trade were held The high narrow windows looked into the gloomy Row the sisters clinging together on the most remote window seat as Mr Smith tells me he found them when he came that Saturday evening to take them to the Opera could see nothing of motion or of change in the grim dark houses opposite so near and close although the whole breadth of the Row was between The mighty roar of London was round them like the sound of an unseen ocean yet every footfall on the pavement below might be heard distinctly in that unfrequented street Such as it was they preferred remaining at the Chapter Coffee house to accepting the invitation which Mr Smith and his mother urged upon them and in after years Charlotte says Since those days I have seen the West End the parks the fine squares but I love the City far better The City seems so much more in earnest its business its rush its roar are such serious things sights sounds The City is getting its living the West End but enjoying its pleasure At the West End you may be amused but in the City you are deeply excited Villette vol i p Their wish had been to hear Dr Croly on the Sunday morning and Mr Williams escorted them to St Stephen s Walbrook but they were disappointed as Dr Croly did not preach Mr Williams also took them as Miss Bront has mentioned to drink tea at his house On the way thither they had to pass through Kensington Gardens and Miss Bront was much struck with the beauty of the scene the fresh verdure of the turf and the soft rich masses of foliage From remarks on the different character of the landscape in the South to what it was in the North she was led to speak of the softness and varied intonation of the voices of those with whom she conversed in London which seem to have made a strong impression on both sisters All this time those who came in contact with the Miss Browns another pseudonym also beginning with B seem only to have regarded them as shy and reserved little country women with not much to say Mr Williams tells me that on the night when he accompanied the party to the Opera as Charlotte ascended the flight of stairs leading from the grand entrance up to the lobby of the first tier of boxes she was so much struck with the architectural effect of the splendid decorations of that vestibule and saloon that involuntarily she slightly pressed his arm and whispered You know I am not accustomed to this sort of thing Indeed it must have formed a vivid contrast to what they were doing and seeing an hour or two earlier the night before when they were trudging along with beating hearts and high strung courage on the road between Haworth and Keighley hardly thinking of the thunder storm that beat about their heads for the thoughts which filled them of how they would go straight away to London and prove that they were really two people and not one imposter It was no wonder that they returned to Haworth utterly fagged and worn out after the fatigue and excitement of this visit The next notice I find of Charlotte s life at this time is of a different character to anything telling of enjoyment July th Branwell is the same in conduct as ever His constitution seems much shattered Papa and sometimes all of us have sad nights with him He sleeps most of the day and consequently will lie awake at night But has not every house its trial While her most intimate friends were yet in ignorance of the fact of her authorship of Jane Eyre she received a letter from one of them making inquiries about Casterton School It is but right to give her answer written on August th Since you wish to hear from me while you are from home I will write without further delay It often happens that when we linger at first in answering a friend s letter obstacles occur to retard us to an inexcusably late period In my last I forgot to answer a question which you asked me and was sorry afterwards for the omission I will begin therefore by replying to it though I fear what information I can give will come a little late You said Mrs had some thoughts of sending to school and wished to know whether the Clergy Daughters School at Casterton was an eligible place My personal knowledge of that institution is very much out of date being derived from the experience of twenty years ago The establishment was at that time in its infancy and a sad rickety infancy it was Typhus fever decimated the school periodically and consumption and scrofula in every variety of form bad air and water bad and insufficient diet can generate preyed on the ill fated pupils It would not THEN have been a fit place for any of Mrs s children but I understand it is very much altered for the better since those days The school is removed from Cowan Bridge a situation as unhealthy as it was picturesque low damp beautiful with wood and water to Casterton The accommodations the diet the discipline the system of tuition all are I believe entirely altered and greatly improved I was told that such pupils as behaved well and remained at the school till their education was finished were provided with situations as governesses if they wished to adopt the vocation and much care was exercised in the selection it was added that they were also furnished with an excellent wardrobe on leaving Casterton The oldest family in Haworth failed lately and have quitted the neighbourhood where their fathers resided before them for it is said thirteen generations Papa I am most thankful to say continues in very good health considering his age his sight too rather I think improves than deteriorates My sisters likewise are pretty well But the dark cloud was hanging over that doomed household and gathering blackness every hour On October the th she thus writes The past three weeks have been a dark interval in our humble home Branwell s constitution had been failing fast all the summer but still neither the doctors nor himself thought him so near his end as he was He was entirely confined to his bed but for one single day and was in the village two days before his death He died after twenty minutes struggle on Sunday morning September th He was perfectly conscious till the last agony came on His mind had undergone the peculiar change which frequently precedes death two days previously the calm of better feelings filled it a return of natural affection marked his last moments He is in God s hands now and the All Powerful is likewise the All Merciful A deep conviction that he rests at last rests well after his brief erring suffering feverish life fills and quiets my mind now The final separation the spectacle of his pale corpse gave me more acute bitter pain than I could have imagined Till the last hour comes we never how know much we can forgive pity regret a near relative All his vices were and are nothing now We remember only his woes Papa was acutely distressed at first but on the whole has borne the event well Emily and Anne are pretty well though Anne is always delicate and Emily has a cold and cough at present It was my fate to sink at the crisis when I should have collected my strength Headache and sickness came on first on the Sunday I could not regain my appetite Then internal pain attacked me I became at once much reduced It was impossible to touch a morsel At last bilious fever declared itself I was confined to bed a week a dreary week But thank God health seems now returning I can sit up all day and take moderate nourishment The doctor said at first I should be very slow in recovering but I seem to get on faster than he anticipated I am truly MUCH BETTER I have heard from one who attended Branwell in his last illness that he resolved on standing up to die He had repeatedly said that as long as there was life there was strength of will to do what it chose and when the last agony came on he insisted on assuming the position just mentioned I have previously stated that when his fatal attack came on his pockets were found filled with old letters from the woman to whom he was attached He died she lives still in May Fair The Eumenides I suppose went out of existence at the time when the wail was heard Great Pan is dead I think we could better have spared him than those awful Sisters who sting dead conscience into life I turn from her for ever Let us look once more into the Parsonage at Haworth Oct th I think I have now nearly got over the effects of my late illness and am almost restored to my normal condition of health I sometimes wish that it was a little higher but we ought to be content with such blessings as we have and not pine after those that are out of our reach I feel much more uneasy about my sister than myself just now Emily s cold and cough are very obstinate I fear she has pain in her chest and I sometimes catch a shortness in her breathing when she has moved at all quickly She looks very thin and pale Her reserved nature occasions me great uneasiness of mind It is useless to question her you get no answers It is still more useless to recommend remedies they are never adopted Nor can I shut my eyes to Anne s great delicacy of constitution The late sad event has I feel made me more apprehensive than common I cannot help feeling much depressed sometimes I try to leave all in God s hands to trust in His goodness but faith and resignation are difficult to practise under some circumstances The weather has been most unfavourable for invalids of late sudden changes of temperature and cold penetrating winds have been frequent here Should the atmosphere become more settled perhaps a favourable effect might be produced on the general health and these harassing colds and coughs be removed Papa has not quite escaped but he has so far stood it better than any of us You must not mention my going to this winter I could not and would not leave home on any account Miss has been for some years out of health now These things make one FEEL as well as KNOW that this world is not our abiding place We should not knit human ties too close or clasp human affections too fondly They must leave us or we must leave them one day God restore health and strength to all who need it I go on now with her own affecting words in the biographical notice of her sisters But a great change approached Affliction came in that shape which to anticipate is dread to look back on grief In the very heat and burden of the day the labourers failed over their work My sister Emily first declined Never in all her life had she lingered over any task that lay before her and she did not linger now She sank rapidly She made haste to leave us Day by day when I saw with what a front she met suffering I looked on her with an anguish of wonder and love I have seen nothing like it but indeed I have never seen her parallel in anything Stronger than a man simpler than a child her nature stood alone The awful point was that while full of ruth for others on herself she had no pity the spirit was inexorable to the flesh from the trembling hands the unnerved limbs the fading eyes the same service was exacted as they had rendered in health To stand by and witness this and not dare to remonstrate was a pain no words can render In fact Emily never went out of doors after the Sunday succeeding Branwell s death She made no complaint she would not endure questioning she rejected sympathy and help Many a time did Charlotte and Anne drop their sewing or cease from their writing to listen with wrung hearts to the failing step the laboured breathing the frequent pauses with which their sister climbed the short staircase yet they dared not notice what they observed with pangs of suffering even deeper than hers They dared not notice it in words far less by the caressing assistance of a helping arm or hand They sat still and silent Nov rd I told you Emily was ill in my last letter She has not rallied yet She is VERY ill I believe if you were to see her your impression would be that there is no hope A more hollow wasted pallid aspect I have not beheld The deep tight cough continues the breathing after the least exertion is a rapid pant and these symptoms are accompanied by pains in the chest and side Her pulse the only time she allowed it be to felt was found to beat per minute In this state she resolutely refuses to see a doctor she will give no explanation of her feelings she will scarcely allow her feelings to be alluded to Our position is and has been for some weeks exquisitely painful God only knows how all this is to terminate More than once I have been forced boldly to regard the terrible event of her loss as possible and even probable But nature shrinks from such thoughts I think Emily seems the nearest thing to my heart in the world When a doctor had been sent for and was in the very house Emily refused to see him Her sisters could only describe to him what symptoms they had observed and the medicines which he sent she would not take denying that she was ill Dec th I hardly know what to say to you about the subject which now interests me the most keenly of anything in this world for in truth I hardly know what to think myself Hope and fear fluctuate daily The pain in her side and chest is better the cough the shortness of breath the extreme emaciation continue I have endured however such tortures of uncertainty on this subject that at length I could endure it no longer and as her repugnance to seeing a medical man continues immutable as she declares no poisoning doctor shall come near her I have written unknown to her to an eminent physician in London giving as minute a statement of her case and symptoms as I could draw up and requesting an opinion I expect an answer in a day or two I am thankful to say that my own health at present is very tolerable It is well such is the case for Anne with the best will in the world to be useful is really too delicate to do or bear much She too at present has frequent pains in the side Papa is also pretty well though Emily s state renders him very anxious The s Anne Bront s former pupils were here about a week ago They are attractive and stylish looking girls They seemed overjoyed to see Anne when I went into the room they were clinging round her like two children she meantime looking perfectly quiet and passive I and H took it into their heads to come here I think it probable offence was taken on that occasion from what cause I know not and as if such be the case the grudge must rest upon purely imaginary grounds and since besides I have other things to think about my mind rarely dwells upon the subject If Emily were but well I feel as if I should not care who neglected misunderstood or abused me I would rather you were not of the number either The crab cheese arrived safely Emily has just reminded me to thank you for it it looks very nice I wish she were well enough to eat it But Emily was growing rapidly worse I remember Miss Bront s shiver at recalling the pang she felt when after having searched in the little hollows and sheltered crevices of the moors for a lingering spray of heather just one spray however withered to take in to Emily she saw that the flower was not recognised by the dim and indifferent eyes Yet to the last Emily adhered tenaciously to her habits of independence She would suffer no one to assist her Any effort to do so roused the old stern spirit One Tuesday morning in December she arose and dressed herself as usual making many a pause but doing everything for herself and even endeavouring to take up her employment of sewing the servants looked on and knew what the catching rattling breath and the glazing of the eye too surely foretold but she kept at her work and Charlotte and Anne though full of unspeakable dread had still the faintest spark of hope On that morning Charlotte wrote thus probably in the very presence of her dying sister Tuesday I should have written to you before if I had had one word of hope to say but I have not She grows daily weaker The physician s opinion was expressed too obscurely to be of use He sent some medicine which she would not take Moments so dark as these I have never known I pray for God s support to us all Hitherto He has granted it The morning drew on to noon Emily was worse she could only whisper in gasps Now when it was too late she said to Charlotte If you will send for a doctor I will see him now About two o clock she died Dec st Emily suffers no more from pain or weakness now She never will suffer more in this world She is gone after a hard short conflict She died on TUESDAY the very day I wrote to you I thought it very possible she might be with us still for weeks and a few hours afterwards she was in eternity Yes there is no Emily in time or on earth now Yesterday we put her poor wasted mortal frame quietly under the church pavement We are very calm at present Why should we be otherwise The anguish of seeing her suffer is over the spectacle of the pains of death is gone by the funeral day is past We feel she is at peace No need now to tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind Emily does not feel them She died in a time of promise We saw her taken from life in its prime But it is God s will and the place where she is gone is better than that she has left God has sustained me in a way that I marvel at through such agony as I had not conceived I now look at Anne and wish she were well and strong but she is neither nor is papa Could you now come to us for a few days I would not ask you to stay long Write and tell me if you could come next week and by what train I would try to send a gig for you to Keighley You will I trust find us tranquil Try to come I never so much needed the consolation of a friend s presence Pleasure of course there would be none for you in the visit except what your kind heart would teach you to find in doing good to others As the old bereaved father and his two surviving children followed the coffin to the grave they were joined by Keeper Emily s fierce faithful bull dog He walked alongside of the mourners and into the church and stayed quietly there all the time that the burial service was being read When he came home he lay
