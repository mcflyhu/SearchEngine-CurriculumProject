Two Sundays in succession we had not been to church As we were going out after lessons on Monday morning a thunder storm came on So Bettina and I played in the upstairs passage I remember how dark it grew although there was a skylight overhead and a window opening on the staircase We groped for our playthings in the twilight till quite suddenly the crois e of the casement showed as ink black lines crossing a square of blue white fire The shadowy stair was fiercely lit our toys too and our faces The moment after we sat in blackness waiting for the thunder Far off it seemed to fall clattering down some vast incline Then the rain Thudding torrents that threatened to batter in the skylight Our mother came out of her room in time to receive the next flash full upon her face I see the light now making her eyes glitter and her paleness ghostlike She drew back from the window Before the[Pg ] lightning died I had seen that she was frightened I had been frightened too till I saw that she was In the impulse to reassure her my own fear left me I went to her in that second blackness and put my hand in hers When I could see again I looked through the streaming window pane as we stood there and I saw a man sheltering under the chestnut tree at our gate He lifted his umbrella and seemed to make a sign May I come in Why there is Colonel Dover I said and could have bitten my tongue My mother had moved away She seemed not to hear not to have seen I stood half behind the curtain praying God to keep him out I prayed so hard I felt my temples prick with heat and a moisture in my hair A blinding flash made us start back Almost simultaneously came a shock of sound like a cannon shot off in the house We three were clinging together That struck near by my mother said to our relief for we had thought the house must tumble to pieces The storm slackened after that and daylight struggled back We went on with our[Pg ] playing I noticed as my mother went downstairs that she kept her head turned away from the window Presently we heard unaccustomed sounds in the hall The tramping and scraping of heavy feet We looked over the banisters and saw a man being carried in by Kleiner Klaus and our gardener The man s clothes were wet so were his face and hair It was Colonel Dover staring with fixed reproachful eyes at the lady of Duncombe House And my mother with a look I had never seen on her face stood holding open the drawing room door for the bearers to pass Their feet left muddy marks in the hall We did not go downstairs till late that afternoon when the body had been taken away People said the steel ferule of the umbrella had attracted the electric current I knew God had heard my prayer But in striking down my enemy he had struck the chestnut tree It was riven from foot to crotch That was the day I had in mind when I excused my laboured playing You expect me to be as quick as God twilight n Twilight merged into darkness Twilight was sweet with the smell of lilac and freshly turned earth casement n A casement is a window that opens by means of hinges at the side With the casement half open a cold breeze rushed inside clattering clatter Typewriters keep clattering away The typewriter was clattering away torrents n torrent The torrents scoured out a channel down the hill side Sudden rainstorms would bring the mountain torrents rushing down batter v n The batter skied to the center fielder Put a small quantity of sugar into the batter reassure v This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently The airline tried to reassure the customers that the planes were safe prick v n He felt a sharp prick when he stepped on an upturned nail He burst the balloon with a prick of the pin simultaneously adv The radar beam can track a number of targets almost simultaneously The Windows allow a computer user to execute multiple programs simultaneously Windows cannon n The soldiers fired the cannon The cannon thundered in the hills fixed adj Have you two fixed on a date for the wedding yet Once the aim is fixed we should not change it arbitrarily
