The sad curlews annunciators of the autumn had just appeared in a mass in a gray squall fleeing from the high sea under the threat of approaching tempests At the mouth of the southern rivers of the Adour of the Nivelle of the Bidassoa which runs by Spain they wandered above the waters already cold flying low skimming with their wings over the mirror like surfaces And their cries at the fall of the October night seemed to ring the annual half death of the exhausted plants On the Pyrenean lands all bushes and vast woods the melancholy of the rainy nights of declining seasons fell slowly enveloping like a shroud while Ramuntcho walked on the moss covered path without noise shod with rope soles supple and silent in his mountaineer s tread Ramuntcho was coming on foot from a very long distance ascending the regions neighboring the Bay of Biscay toward his isolated house which stood above in a great deal of shade near the Spanish frontier Around the solitary passer by who went up so quickly without trouble and whose march in sandals was not heard distances more and more profound deepened on all sides blended in twilight and mist The autumn the autumn marked itself everywhere The corn herb of the lowlands so magnificently green in the Spring displayed shades of dead straw in the depths of the valleys and on all the summits beeches and oaks shed their leaves The air was almost cold an odorous humidity came out of the mossy earth and at times there came from above a light shower One felt it near and anguishing that season of clouds and of long rains which returns every time with the same air of bringing the definitive exhaustion of saps and irremediable death but which passes like all things and which one forgets at the following spring Everywhere in the wet of the leaves strewing the earth in the wet of the herbs long and bent there was a sadness of death a dumb resignation to fecund decomposition But the autumn when it comes to put an end to the plants brings only a sort of far off warning to man a little more durable who resists several winters and lets himself be lured several times by the charm of spring Man in the rainy nights of October and of November feels especially the instinctive desire to seek shelter at home to warm himself at the hearth under the roof which so many thousand years amassed have taught him progressively to build And Ramuntcho felt awakening in the depths of his being the old ancestral aspirations for the Basque home of the country the isolated home unattached to the neighboring homes He hastened his steps the more toward the primitive dwelling where his mother was waiting for him Here and there one perceived them in the distance indistinct in the twilight the Basque houses very distant from one another dots white or grayish now in the depth of some gorge steeped in darkness then on some ledge of the mountains with summits lost in the obscure sky Almost inconsequential are these human habitations in the immense and confused entirety of things inconsequential and even annihilated quite at this hour before the majesty of the solitude and of the eternal forest nature Ramuntcho ascended rapidly lithe bold and young still a child likely to play on his road as little mountaineers play with a rock a reed or a twig that one whittles while walking The air was growing sharper the environment harsher and already he ceased to hear the cries of the curlews their rusty pulley cries on the rivers beneath But Ramuntcho was singing one of those plaintive songs of the olden time which are still transmitted in the depths of the distant lands and his naive voice went through the mist or the rain among the wet branches of the oaks under the grand shroud more and more sombre of isolation of autumn and of night He stopped for an instant pensive to see a cart drawn by oxen pass at a great distance above him The cowboy who drove the slow team sang also through a bad and rocky path they descended into a ravine bathed in shadows already nocturnal And soon they disappeared in a turn of the path masked suddenly by trees as if they had vanished in an abyss Then Ramuntcho felt the grasp of an unexpected melancholy unexplained like most of his complex impressions and with an habitual gesture while he resumed his less alert march he brought down like a visor on his gray eyes very sharp and very soft the crown of his woolen Basque cap Why What had to do with him this cart this singing cowboy whom he did not even know Evidently nothing and yet for having seen them disappear into a lodging as they did doubtless every night into some farm isolated in a lowland a more exact realization had come to him of the humble life of the peasant attached to the soil and to the native field of those human lives as destitute of joy as beasts of burden but with declines more prolonged and more lamentable And at the same time through his mind had passed the intuitive anxiety for other places for the thousand other things that one may see or do in this world and which one may enjoy a chaos of troubling half thoughts of atavic reminiscences and of phantoms had furtively marked themselves in the depths of his savage child s mind For Ramuntcho was a mixture of two races very different and of two beings separated if one may say it by an abyss of several generations Created by the sad fantasy of one of the refined personages of our dazzled epoch he had been inscribed at his birth as the son of an unknown father and he bore no other name than that of his mother So he did not feel that he was quite similar to his companions in games and healthy fatigues Silent for a moment he walked less quickly toward his house on the deserted paths winding on the heights In him the chaos of other things of the luminous other places of the splendors or of the terrors foreign to his own life agitated itself confusedly trying to disentangle itself But no all this being indistinct and incomprehensible remained formless in the darkness At last thinking no more of it he began to sing his song again The song told in monotonous couplets the complaint of a linen weaver whose lover in a distant war prolonged his absence It was written in that mysterious Euskarian language the age of which seems incalculable and the origin of which remains unknown And little by little under the influence of the ancient melody of the wind and of the solitude Ramuntcho found himself as he was at the beginning of his walk a simple Basque mountaineer sixteen or seventeen years old formed like a man but retaining the ignorance and the candor of a little boy Soon he perceived Etchezar his parish its belfry massive as the dungeon of a fortress near the church some houses were grouped others more numerous had preferred to be disseminated in the surroundings among trees in ravines or on bluffs The night fell entirely hastily that evening because of the sombre veils hooked to the great summits Around this village above or in the valleys the Basque country appeared at that moment like a confusion of gigantic obscure masses Long mists disarranged the perspectives all the distances all the depths had become inappreciable the changing mountains seemed to have grown taller in the nebulous phantasmagoria of night The hour one knew not why became strangely solemn as if the shade of past centuries was to come out of the soil On the vast lifting up which is called the Pyrenees one felt something soaring which was perhaps the finishing mind of that race the fragments of which have been preserved and to which Ramuntcho belonged by his mother And the child composed of two essences so diverse who was walking alone toward his dwelling through the night and the rain began again in the depth of his double being to feel the anxiety of inexplicable reminiscences At last he arrived in front of his house which was very elevated in the Basque fashion with old wooden balconies under narrow windows the glass of which threw into the night the light of a lamp As he came near the entrance the light noise of his walk became feebler in the thickness of the dead leaves the leaves of those plane trees shaped like vaults which according to the usage of the land form a sort of atrium before each dwelling She recognized from afar the steps of her son the serious Franchita pale and straight in her black clothes the one who formerly had loved and followed the stranger then who feeling her desertion approaching had returned courageously to the village in order to inhabit alone the dilapidated house of her deceased parents Rather than to live in the vast city and to be troublesome and a solicitor there she had quickly resolved to depart to renounce everything to make a simple Basque peasant of that little Ramuntcho who at his entrance in life had worn gowns embroidered in white silk It was fifteen years ago fifteen years when she returned clandestinely at a fall of night similar to this one In the first days of this return dumb and haughty to her former companions from fear of their disdain she would go out only to go to church her black cloth mantilla lowered on her eyes Then at length when curiosity was appeased she had returned to her habits so valiantly and so irreproachably that all had forgiven her To greet and embrace her son she smiled with joy and tenderness but silent by nature and reserved as both were they said to each other only what it was useful to say He sat at his accustomed place to eat the soup and the smoking dish which she served to him without speaking The room carefully kalsomined was made gay by the sudden light of a flame of branches in the tall and wide chimney ornamented with a festoon of white calico In frames hooked in good order there were images of Ramuntcho s first communion and different figures of saints with Basque legends then the Virgin of Pilar the Virgin of Anguish and rosaries and blessed palms The kitchen utensils shone in a line on shelves sealed to the walls every shelf ornamented with one of those pink paper frills cut in designs which are manufactured in Spain and on which are printed invariably series of personages dancing with castanets or scenes in the lives of the toreadors In this white interior before this joyful and clear chimney one felt an impression of home a tranquil welfare which was augmented by the notion of the vast wet surrounding night of the grand darkness of the valleys of the mountains and of the woods Franchita as every evening looked long at her son looked at him embellishing and growing taking more and more an air of decision and of force as his brown mustache was more and more marked above his fresh lips When he had supped eaten with his young mountaineer s appetite several slices of bread and drunk two glasses of cider he rose saying I am going to sleep for we have to work tonight Ah exclaimed the mother and when are you to get up At one o clock as soon as the moon sets They will whistle under the window What is it Bundles of silk and bundles of velvet With whom are you going The same as usual Arrochkoa Florentino and the Iragola brothers It is as it was the other night for Itchoua with whom I have just made an engagement Good night mother Oh we shall not be out late and sure I will be back before mass Then Franchita leaned her head on the solid shoulder of her son in a coaxing humor almost infantile different suddenly from her habitual manner and her cheek against his she remained tenderly leaning as if to say in a confident abandonment of her will I am still troubled a little by those night undertakings but when I reflect what you wish is always well I am dependent on you and you are everything On the shoulder of the stranger formerly it was her custom to lean and to abandon herself thus in the time when she loved him When Ramuntcho had gone to his little room she stayed thinking for a longer time than usual before resuming her needlework So it became decidedly his trade this night work in which one risks receiving the bullets of Spain s carbineers He had begun for amusement in bravado like most of them and as his friend Arrochkoa was beginning in the same band as he then little by little he had made a necessity of this continual adventure in dark nights he deserted more and more for this rude trade the open air workshop of the carpenter where she had placed him as an apprentice to carve beams out of oak trunks And that was what he would be in life her little Ramuntcho so coddled formerly in his white gown and for whom she had formed naively so many dreams a smuggler Smuggler and pelota player two things which go well together and which are essentially Basque She hesitated still however to let him follow that unexpected vocation Not in disdain for smugglers oh no for her father had been a smuggler her two brothers also the elder killed by a Spanish bullet in the forehead one night that he was swimming across the Bidassoa the second a refugee in America to escape the Bayonne prison both respected for their audacity and their strength No but he Ramuntcho the son of the stranger he doubtless might have had pretensions to lead a less harsh life than these men if in a hasty and savage moment she had not separated him from his father and brought him back to the Basque mountains In truth he was not heartless Ramuntcho s father when fatally he had wearied of her he had made some efforts not to let her see it and never would he have abandoned her with her child if in her pride she had not quitted him Perhaps it would be her duty to day to write to him to ask him to think of his son And now the image of Gracieuse presented itself naturally to her mind as it did every time she thought of Ramuntcho s future She was the little betrothed whom she had been wishing for him for ten years In the sections of country unacquainted with modern fashions it is usual to marry when very young and often to know and select one another for husband and wife in the first years of life A little girl with hair fluffed in a gold mist daughter of a friend of her childhood of a certain Dolores Detcharry who had been always conceited and who had remained contemptuous since the epoch of the great fault Certainly the father s intervention in the future of Ramuntcho would have a decisive influence in obtaining the hand of that girl and would permit even of asking it of Dolores with haughtiness after the ancient quarrel But Franchita felt a great uneasiness in her increasing as the thought of addressing herself to that man became more precise And then she recalled the look so often sombre of the stranger she recalled his vague words of infinite lassitude of incomprehensible despair he had the air of seeing always beyond her horizon distant abysses and darkness and although he was not an insulter of sacred things never would he pray thus giving to her this excess of remorse of having allied herself to some pagan to whom heaven would be closed forever His friends were similar to him refined also faithless prayerless exchanging among themselves in frivolous words abysmal thoughts Oh if Ramuntcho by contact with them were to become similar to them all desert the churches fly from the sacraments and the mass Then she remembered the letters of her old father now decomposed in the profound earth under a slab of granite near the foundations of his parish church those letters in Euskarian tongue which he wrote to her after the first months of indignation and of silence in the city where she had dragged her fault At least my poor Franchita my daughter are you in a country where the men are pious and go to church regularly Oh no they were hardly pious the men of the great city not more the fashionable ones who were in the society of Ramuntcho s father than the humblest laborers in the suburban district where she lived hidden all carried away by the same current far from the hereditary dogmas far from the antique symbols And Ramuntcho in such surroundings how would he resist Other reasons less important perhaps retained her also Her haughty dignity which in that city had maintained her honest and solitary revolted truly at the idea that she would have to reappear as a solicitor before her former lover Then her superior commonsense which nothing had ever been able to lead astray or to dazzle told her that it was too late now to change anything that Ramuntcho until now ignorant and free would not know how to attain the dangerous regions where the intelligence of his father had elevated itself but that he would languish at the bottom like one outclassed And in fine a sentiment which she hardly confessed to herself lingered powerfully in the depths of her heart the fear of losing her son of guiding him no longer of holding him no longer of having him no longer And so in that instant of decisive reflection after having hesitated for years she inclined more and more to remain stubborn in her silence with regard to the stranger and to let pass humbly near her the life of her Ramuntcho under the protecting looks of the Virgin and the saints There remained unsolved the question of Gracieuse Detcharry Well she would marry in spite of everything her son smuggler and poor though he be With her instinct of a mother somewhat savagely loving she divined that the little girl was enamoured enough not to fall out of love ever she had seen this in her fifteen year old black eyes obstinate and grave under the golden nimbus of her hair Gracieuse marrying Ramuntcho for his charm alone in spite of and against maternal will The rancor and vindictiveness that lurked in the mind of Franchita rejoiced suddenly at that great triumph over the pride of Dolores Around the isolated house where under the grand silence of midnight she decided alone her son s future the spirit of the Basque ancestors passed sombre and jealous also disdainful of the stranger fearful of impiety of changes of evolutions of races the spirit of the Basque ancestors the old immutable spirit which still maintains that people with eyes turned toward the anterior ages the mysterious antique spirit by which the children are led to act as before them their fathers had acted at the side of the same mountains in the same villages around the same belfries The noise of steps now in the dark outside Someone walking softly in sandals on the thickness of the plane tree leaves strewing the soil Then a whistled appeal What already Already one o clock in the morning Quite resolved now she opened the door to the chief smuggler with a smile of greeting that the latter had never seen in her Come in Itchoua she said warm yourself while I go wake up my son A tall and large man that Itchoua thin with a thick chest clean shaven like a priest in accordance with the fashion of the old time Basque under the cap which he never took off a colorless face inexpressive cut as with a pruning hook and recalling the beardless personages archaically drawn on the missals of the fifteenth century Above his hollow cheeks the breadth of the jaws the jutting out of the muscles of the neck gave the idea of his extreme force He was of the Basque type excessively accentuated eyes caved in too much under the frontal arcade eyebrows of rare length the points of which lowered as on the figures of tearful madonnas almost touched the hair at the temples Between thirty and fifty years it was impossible to assign an age to him His name was Jose Maria Gorosteguy but according to the custom he was known in the country by the surname of Itchoua the Blind given to him in jest formerly because of his piercing sight which plunged in the night like that of cats He was a practising Christian a church warden of his parish and a chorister with a thundering voice He was famous also for his power of resistance to fatigue being capable of climbing the Pyrenean slopes for hours at racing speed with heavy loads on his back Ramuntcho came down soon rubbing his eyelids still heavy from a youthful sleep and at his aspect the gloomy visage of Itchoua was illuminated by a smile A continual seeker for energetic and strong boys that he might enroll in his band and knowing how to keep them in spite of small wages by a sort of special point of honor he was an expert in legs and in shoulders as well as in temperaments and he thought a great deal of his new recruit Franchita before she would let them go leaned her head again on her son s neck then she escorted the two men to the
