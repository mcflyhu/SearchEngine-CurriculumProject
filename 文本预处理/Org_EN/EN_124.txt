Now the Newbern was famous for being a good roller and she lived up to her reputation For seven days I saw only the inside of our stateroom At the end of that time we arrived off Cape St Lucas the extreme southern point of Lower California and I went on deck We anchored and took cattle aboard I watched the natives tow them off the cattle swimming behind their small boats and then saw the poor beasts hoisted up by their horns to the deck of our ship I thought it most dreadfully cruel but was informed that it had been done from time immemorial so I ceased to talk about it knowing that I could not reform those aged countries and realizing faintly perhaps for I had never seen much of the rough side of life that just as cruel things were done to the cattle we consume in the North Now that Mr Sinclair in his great book The Jungle has brought the multiplied horrors of the great packing houses before our very eyes we might witness the hoisting of the cattle over the ship s side without feeling such intense pity admitting that everything is relative even cruelty It was now the middle of August and the weather had become insufferably hot but we were out of the long swell of the Pacific Ocean we had rounded Cape St Lucas and were steaming up the Gulf of California towards the mouth of the Great Colorado whose red and turbulent waters empty themselves into this gulf at its head I now had time to become acquainted with the officers of the regiment whom I had not before met they had come in from other posts and joined the command at San Francisco The daughter of the lieutenant colonel was on board the beautiful and graceful Caroline Wilkins the belle of the regiment and Major Worth to whose company my husband belonged I took a special interest in the latter as I knew we must face life together in the wilds of Arizona I had time to learn something about the regiment and its history and that Major Worth s father whose monument I had so often seen in New York was the first colonel of the Eighth Infantry when it was organized in the State of New York in The party on board was merry enough and even gay There was Captain Ogilby a great genial Scotchman and Captain Porter a graduate of Dublin and so charmingly witty He seemed very devoted to Miss Wilkins but Miss Wilkins was accustomed to the devotion of all the officers of the Eighth Infantry In fact it was said that every young lieutenant who joined the regiment had proposed to her She was most attractive and as she had too kind a heart to be a coquette she was a universal favorite with the women as well as with the men There was Ella Bailey too Miss Wilkins sister with her young and handsome husband and their young baby Then dear Mrs Wilkins who had been so many years in the army that she remembered crossing the plains in a real ox team She represented the best type of the older army woman and it was so lovely to see her with her two daughters all in the same regiment A mother of grown up daughters was not often met with in the army And Lieutenant Colonel Wilkins a gentleman in the truest sense of the word a man of rather quiet tastes never happier than when he had leisure for indulging his musical taste in strumming all sorts of Spanish fandangos on the guitar or his somewhat marked talent with the pencil and brush The heat of the staterooms compelled us all to sleep on deck so our mattresses were brought up by the soldiers at night and spread about The situation however was so novel and altogether ludicrous and our fear of rats which ran about on deck so great that sleep was well nigh out of the question Before dawn we fled to our staterooms but by sunrise we were glad to dress and escape from their suffocating heat and go on deck again Black coffee and hard tack were sent up and this sustained us until the nine o clock breakfast which was elaborate but not good There was no milk of course except the heavily sweetened sort which I could not use it was the old time condensed and canned milk the meats were beyond everything except the poor tough fresh beef we had seen hoisted over the side at Cape St Lucas The butter poor at the best began to pour like oil Black coffee and bread and a baked sweet potato seemed the only things that I could swallow The heat in the Gulf of California was intense Our trunks were brought up from the vessel s hold and we took out summer clothing But how inadequate and inappropriate it was for that climate Our faces burned and blistered even the parting on the head burned under the awnings which were kept spread The ice supply decreased alarmingly the meats turned green and when the steward went down into the refrigerator which was somewhere below the quarter deck to get provisions for the day every woman held a bottle of salts to her nose and the officers fled to the forward part of the ship The odor which ascended from that refrigerator was indescribable it lingered and would not go It followed us to the table and when we tasted the food we tasted the odor We bribed the steward for ice Finally I could not go below at all but had a baked sweet potato brought on deck and lived several days upon that diet On the th of August we anchored off Mazatlan a picturesque and ancient adobe town in old Mexico The approach to this port was strikingly beautiful Great rocks cut by the surf into arches and caverns guarded the entrance to the harbor We anchored two miles out A customs and a Wells Fargo boat boarded us and many natives came along side bringing fresh cocoanuts bananas and limes Some Mexicans bound for Guaymas came on board and a troupe of Japanese jugglers While we were unloading cargo some officers and their wives went on shore in one of the ship s boats and found it a most interesting place It was garrisoned by Mexican troops uniformed in white cotton shirts and trousers They visited the old hotel the amphitheatre where the bull fights were held and the old fort They told also about the cock pits and about the refreshing drinks they had My thirst began to be abnormal We bought a dozen cocoanuts and I drank the milk from them and made up my mind to go ashore at the next port for after nine days with only thick black coffee and bad warm water to drink I was longing for a cup of good tea or a glass of fresh sweet milk A day or so more brought us to Guaymas another Mexican port Mrs Wilkins said she had heard something about an old Spaniard there who used to cook meals for stray travellers This was enough I was desperately hungry and thirsty and we decided to try and find him Mrs Wilkins spoke a little Spanish and by dint of inquiries we found the man s house a little old forlorn deserted looking adobe casa We rapped vigorously upon the old door and after some minutes a small withered old man appeared Mrs Wilkins told him what we wanted but this ancient Delmonico declined to serve us and said in Spanish the country was a desert he had nothing in the house he had not cooked a meal in years he could not and finally he would not and he gently pushed the door to in our faces But we did not give it up and Mrs Wilkins continued to persuade I mustered what Spanish I knew and told him I would pay him any price for a cup of coffee with fresh milk He finally yielded and told us to return in one hour So we walked around the little deserted town I could think only of the breakfast we were to have in the old man s casa And it met and exceeded our wildest anticipations for just fancy We were served with a delicious boullion then chicken perfectly cooked accompanied by some dish flavored with chile verde creamy biscuit fresh butter and golden coffee with milk There were three or four women and several officers in the party and we had a merry breakfast We paid the old man generously thanked him warmly and returned to the ship fortified to endure the sight of all the green ducks that came out of the lower hold You must remember that the Newbern was a small and old propeller not fitted up for passengers and in those days the great refrigerating plants were unheard of The women who go to the Philippines on our great transports of to day cannot realize and will scarcely believe what we endured for lack of ice and of good food on that never to be forgotten voyage down the Pacific coast and up the Gulf of California in the summer of
