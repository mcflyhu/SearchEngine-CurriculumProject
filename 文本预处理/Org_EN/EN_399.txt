Mother dear It was the voice of Betty Harris eager triumphant with a little laugh running through it Mother dear Yes Betty The woman seated at the dark mahogany desk looked up a little line between her eyes You have come child It was half a caress She put out an absent hand drawing the child toward her while she finished her note The child stood by gravely looking with shining eyes at the face bending above the paper It was a handsome face with clear hard lines the reddish hair brushed up conventionally from the temples and the skin a little pallid under its careful massage and skilfully touched surface To Betty Harris her mother was the most beautiful woman in the world more beautiful than the marble Venus at the head of the long staircase or the queenly lady in the next room forever stepping down from her gilded frame into the midst of tapestry and leather in the library It may have been that Betty s mother was quite as much a work of art in her way as these other treasures that had come from the Old World But to Betty Harris who had slight knowledge of art values her mother was beautiful because her eyes had little points of light in them that danced when she laughed and her lips curved prettily like a bow if she smiled They curved now as she looked up from her note Well daughter She had sealed the note and laid it one side Was it a good lesson She leaned back in her chair stroking the child s hand softly while her eyes travelled over the quaint dignified little figure The child was a Velasquez people had often remarked it and the mother had taken the note that gave to her clothes the regal air touched with simplicity So it was a good lesson was it she repeated absently as she stroked the small dark hand her own figure graciously outlined as she leaned back enjoying the lifted face and straight clear eyes Mother dear The child s voice vibrated with the intensity behind it I have seen a man a very good man Yes There was a little laugh in the word She was accustomed to the child s enthusiasms Yet they were always new to her even the old ones were Who was he daughter this very good man He is a Greek mother with a long beautiful name I don t think I can tell it to you But he is most wonderful The child spread her hands and drew a deep breath More wonderful than father It was an idle laughing question while she studied the lifted up face More wonderful than father yes The child nodded gravely I can t quite tell you mother dear how it feels She laid a tiny hand on her chest Her eyes were full of thought He speaks like music and he loves things oh very much I see And did Madame Lewandowska introduce you to him Oh it was not there The child s face cleared with swift thought I didn t tell you Madame was ill The reclining figure straightened a little in its place but the face was still smiling So you and Miss Stone But Miss Stone is ill mother dear Did you forget her toothache The tone was politely reproachful The woman was very erect now her small eyes grown wide gazing at the child devouring her Betty Where have you been It was more a cry than a question a cry of dismay running swiftly toward terror It was the haunting fear of her life that Betty would some day be kidnapped as the child next door had been The fingers resting on the arm of the chair were held tense I don t think I did wrong mother The child was looking at her very straight as if answering a challenge You see I walked home Where was James The woman s tone was sharp and her hand reached toward the bell but the child s hand moved softly toward it I d like to tell you about it myself please mother James never waits for the lessons I don t think he was to blame The woman s eyes were veiled with sudden mist She drew the child close Tell mother about it Betty Harris looked down stroking her mother s sleeve A little smile of memory held her lips He was a beautiful man she said The mother waited breathless I was walking home and I came to his shop To his shop She nodded reassuringly His fruit shop and oh I forgot She reached into the little bag at her side tugging at something He gave me these She produced the round box and took off the lid looking into it with pleased eyes Aren t they beautiful The mother bent blindly to it Pomegranates she said Her lips were still a little white but they smiled bravely with the child s pleasure Pomegranates said Betty nodding That is what he called them I should like to taste one She was looking at them a little wistfully We will have them for luncheon said the mother She had touched the bell with quick decision Marie she held out the box tell Nesmer to serve these with luncheon Am I to have luncheon with you mother dear The child s eyes were on her mother s face With me yes The reply was prompt if a little tremulous The child sighed happily It is being a marvellous day she said quaintly The mother smiled Come and get ready for luncheon and then you shall tell me about the wonderful man So it came about that Betty Harris seated across the dark shining table told her mother Mrs Philip Harris a happy adventure wherein she Betty Harris who had never before set foot unattended in the streets of Chicago had wandered for an hour and more in careless freedom and straying at last into the shop of a marvellous Greek one Achilles Alexandrakis by name had heard strange tales of Greece and Athens and the Parthenon tales at the very mention of which her eyes danced and her voice rippled And her mother listening across the table trembled at the dangers the child touched upon and flitted past It had been part of the careful rearing of Betty Harris that she should not guess that the constant attendance upon her was a body guard such as might wait upon a princess It had never occurred to Betty Harris that other little girls were not guarded from the moment they rose in the morning till they went to bed at night and that even at night Miss Stone slept within sound of her breath She had grown up happy and care free with no suspicion of the danger that threatened the child of a marked millionaire She did not even know that her father was a very rich man so protected had she been She was only a little more simple than most children of twelve And she met the world with straight shining looks speaking to rich and poor with a kind of open simplicity that won the heart Her mother watching the clear eyes had a sudden pang of what the morning might have been the disillusionment and terror of this unprotected hour that had been made instead a memory of delight thanks to an unknown Greek named Achilles Alexandrakis who had told her of the beauties of Greece and the Parthenon and had given her fresh pomegranates to carry home in a round box The mother s thoughts rested on the man with a quick sense of gratitude He should be paid a thousand times over for his care of Betty Harris and for pomegranates They are like the Parthenon said the child
