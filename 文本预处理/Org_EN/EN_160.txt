There were not many guests Elizabeth had chosen them carefully from families which had known her father Henry Cornish when in his reckless adventurous way he had been laying the basis of the Cornish fortune in the Rockies Indeed she was a little angry when she heard of the indiscriminate way in which Vance had scattered the invitations particularly in Craterville But as he said he had acted so as to show her that he had entered fully into the spirit of the thing and that his heart was in the right place as far as this birthday party was concerned and she could not do otherwise than accept his explanation Some of the bidden guests however came from a great distance and as a matter of course a few of them arrived the day before the celebration and filled the quiet rooms of the old house with noise Elizabeth accepted them with resignation and even pleasure because they all had pleasant things to say about her father and good wishes to express for the destined heir Terence Colby It was carefully explained that this selection of an heir had been made by both Elizabeth and Vance which removed all cause for remark Vance himself regarded the guests with distinct amusement But Terence was disgusted What these true Westerners need he said to Elizabeth later in the day is a touch of blood No feeling of family or the dignity of family precedents out here It touched her shrewdly More than once she had felt that Terry was on the verge of becoming a complacent prig So she countered with a sharp thrust You have to remember that you re a Westerner born and bred my dear A very Westerner yourself Birth is an accident birthplaces I mean smiled Terence It s the blood that tells Terry you re a snob exclaimed Aunt Elizabeth I hope not he answered But look yonder now Old George Armstrong s daughter Nelly had gone up a tree like a squirrel and was laughing down through the branches at a raw boned cousin on the ground beneath her And what of it said Elizabeth That girl is pretty enough to please any man and she s the type that makes a wife Terry rubbed his chin with his knuckles thoughtfully It was the one family habit that he had contracted from Vance much to the irritation of the latter After all said Terry with complacency what are good looks with bad grammar Elizabeth snorted literally and most unfemininely Terence she said lessoning him with her bony long forefinger you re just young enough to be wise about women When you re a little older you ll get sense If you want white hands and good grammar how do you expect to find a wife in the mountains Terry answered with unshaken lordly calm I haven t thought about the details They don t matter But a man must have standards of criticism Standards your foot cried Aunt Elizabeth You insufferable young prig That very girl laughing down through the branches I ll wager she could set your head spinning in ten seconds if she thought it worth her while to try Perhaps smiled Terence In the meantime she has freckles and a vocabulary without growing pains All men are fools declared Aunt Elizabeth but boys are idiots bless em Terence before you grow up you ll have sore toes from stumbling take my word for it Do you know what a wise man would do Well Go out and start a terrific flirtation with Nelly For the sake of experience sighed Terence Good heavens groaned Aunt Elizabeth Terry you re impossible Where are you going now Out to see El Sangre He went whistling out of the door and she followed him with confused feelings of anger pride joy and fear She went to a side window and saw him go fearlessly into the corral where the man destroying El Sangre was kept And the big stallion red fire in the sunshine went straight to him and nosed at a hip pocket They had already struck up a perfect understanding Deeply she wondered at it She had never loved the mountains and their people and their ways It had been a battle to fight She had fought the battle won and gained a hollow victory And watching Terry caress the great beautiful horse she knew vaguely that his heart at least was in tune with the wilderness I wish to heaven Terry she murmured that you could find a master as El Sangre has done You need teaching When she turned from the window she found Vance watching her He had a habit of obscurely melting into a background and looking out at her unexpectedly All at once she knew that he had been there listening during all of her talk with Terence Not that the talk had been of a peculiarly private nature but it angered her There was just a semblance of eavesdropping about the presence of Vance For she knew that Terence unbosomed himself to her as he would do in the hearing of no other human being However she mastered her anger and smiled at her brother He had taken all these recent changes which were so much to his disadvantage with a good spirit that astonished and touched her Do you know what I m going to give Terry for his birthday he said sauntering toward her Well A mention of Terence and his welfare always disarmed her completely She opened her eyes and her heart and smiled at her brother There s no set of Scott in the house I m going to give Terry one Do you think he ll ever read the novels I never could That antiquated style Vance keeps me at arm s length A stiff style because he wrote so rapidly But there s the greatest body and bone of character Except for his heroes Terry reminds me of them in a way No thought not very much feeling but a great capacity for physical action I think you d like to be Terry s adviser she said I wouldn t aspire to the job yawned Vance unless I could ride well and shoot well If a man can t do that he ceases to be a man in Terry s eyes And if a woman can t talk pure English she isn t a woman That s because he s young said Elizabeth It s because he s a prig sneered Vance He had been drawn farther into the conversation than he planned now he retreated carefully But another year or so may help him He retreated before she could answer but he left her thoughtful as he hoped to do He had a standing theory that the only way to make a woman meditate is to keep her from talking And he wanted very much to make Elizabeth meditate the evil in the son of Black Jack Otherwise all his plans might be useless and his seeds of destruction fall on barren soil He was intensely afraid of that anyway His hope was to draw the boy and the sheriff together on the birthday and guide the two explosives until they met on the subject of the death of Black Jack Either Terry would kill the sheriff or the sheriff would kill Terry Vance hoped for the latter but rather expected the former to be the outcome and if it were he was inclined to think that Elizabeth would sooner or later make excuses for Terry and take him back into the fold of her affections Accordingly his work was in the few days that intervened to plant all the seeds of suspicion that he could Then when the denouement came those seeds might blossom overnight into poison flowers In the late afternoon he took up his position in an easy chair on the big veranda The mail was delivered as a rule just before dusk one of the cow punchers riding down for it Grave fears about the loss of that all important missive to Terry haunted him for the postmaster was a doddering old fellow who was quite apt to forget his head Consequently he was vastly relieved when the mail arrived and Elizabeth brought the familiar big envelope out to him with its typewritten address Looks like a business letter doesn t it she asked Vance More or less said Vance covering a yawn of excitement But how on earth could any business it s postmarked from Craterville Somebody may have heard about his prospects they re starting early to separate him from his money Vance how much talking did you do in Craterville It was hard to meet her keen old eyes Too much I m afraid he said frankly You see I ve felt rather touchy about the thing I want people to know that you and I have agreed on making Terry the heir to the ranch I don t want anyone to suspect that we differed I suppose I talked too much about the birthday plans She sighed with vexation and weighed the letter in her hand I ve half a mind to open it His heartbeat fluttered and paused Go ahead he urged with well assured carelessness She shook down the contents of the envelope preparatory to opening it It s nothing but printed stuff Vance I can see that through the envelope But wait a minute Elizabeth It might anger Terry to have even his business mail opened He s touchy you know She hesitated then shrugged her shoulders I suppose you re right Let it go She laughed at her own concern over the matter Do you know Vance that sometimes I feel as if the whole world were conspiring to
