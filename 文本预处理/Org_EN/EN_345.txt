Being an individualist a man who had always depended upon himself Canterton had very little of the social sensitiveness that looks cautiously to the right and to the left before taking a certain path All his grown life from his University days onwards he had been dealing with big problems birth growth decay the eternal sacrament of sex the beauty of earth s flowering His vision went deep and far His life had been so full of the fascination of his work that he had never been much of a social animal as the social animal is understood in a country community He observed trifles that were stupendously significant in the world of growth but he had no mind for the social trifles round him Had he had less brawn less virility less humour it is possible that he would have been nothing more than an erudite fool one of those pathetic figures respected for its knowledge and pitied for its sappiness Canterton could convince men and this was because he had long ago become a conviction to himself It was not a self conscious conviction and that was why it had such mastery It never occurred to him to think about the discretions and the formalities of life If a thing seemed good to do he did it if it seemed bad he never gave it a second thought His men believed in him with an instinctive faith that would not suffer contradiction and had Canterton touched tar they would have sworn that the tar was the better for it and Canterton s hands clean He was so big so direct so just so ready to smile and see the humour of everything And he was as clean minded as his child Lynette and no more conscious than she was of the little meannesses and dishonourable curiosities that make most men and nearly all women hypocrites Canterton s eyes were open but he saw only that which his long vision had taught him to see and not the things that are focused by smaller people That an idea seemed fine and admirable and good was sufficient for him He had not cultivated the habit of asking himself what other people might think That was why such a man as Canterton may be so dangerous to himself and to others when he starts to do some big and unusual thing He knew now that he loved Eve Carfax It was like the sudden rising of some enchanted island out of the sea magical yet real nor was he a gross beast to break down the boughs for the fruit and to crush the flowers for their perfumes He had the atmosphere of a fine mind and his scheme of values was different from the scheme of values recognised by more ordinary men Perfumes colours beautiful outlines had spiritual and mystical meanings He was not Pagan and not Christian but a blend of all that was best in both To him this enchanted island had risen out of the sea and floated dew drenched in the pure light of the dawn He saw no reason why he should bid so beautiful a thing sink back again and be lost under the waters He had no desecrating impulses Why should not two people look together at life with eyes that smiled and understood They were harming no one and they were transfiguring each other Canterton and his wife were dining alone and for once he deliberately chose to talk to her of his work and of his future plans Gertrude would listen perfunctorily but he was determined that she should listen The intimate part of his life did not concern her simply because she was no longer either in his personality or in his work So little sympathy was there between them that they had never succeeded in rising to a serious quarrel I am taking Miss Carfax into the business I thought you might like to know So dead was her personal pride in all that was male in him that she did not remember to be jealous That ought to be a great opportunity for the girl I shall benefit as much as she will She has a very remarkable gift just something I felt the need of and could not find Then she is quite a discovery Canterton watched his wife s face and saw no clouding of its complacency She will be a very great help in many ways I see You will make her a kind of fashion plate artist to produce new designs Yes I had thought of doing something for the girl I had suggested to her that she might paint miniatures I think I shall keep her pretty busy I have only spoken to her once or twice and she struck me as rather reserved and stiff I suppose she and Lynette She and Lynette get on wonderfully So Miss Vance told me And of course that black frock I hope she doesn t spoil the child Not a bit She does her good Lynette wants someone with plenty of common sense to discipline her I think Miss Vance is really excellent A very reliable young woman She s not too sentimental and emotional They had finished dessert and Gertrude Canterton went straight to her desk to write some of those innumerable letters that took up such a large part of her life Letter writing was one of her methods of self expression and her busy audacity was never to be repelled She wrote to an infinite number of charitable institutions for their literature to authors for autograph copies of their books to sell at bazaars to actors for their signatures and photographs to cartoonists for some sketch or other on which money might be raised for some charitable purpose to tradesmen for free goods offering them her patronage and a fine advertisement on some stall Canterton did not wait for coffee but lit a pipe and strolled out into the garden and walking up and down in a state of wonder tried to make himself realise that he and Gertrude were man and wife Had the conversation really taken place Had they exchanged those cold commonplaces those absurd phrases that should have meant so much Had he known Gertrude less well he might have been touched by the appearance of the limitless faith she had in him by her blind and serene confidence that was not capable of being disturbed But he knew her better than that He was hardly so much as a shadow in her life and when a second shadow appeared beside hers she did not notice it She seemed to have no sense of possession no sexual pride Her mental poise was like some people s idea of heaven a place of beautiful and boundless indifference misnamed sacred love a state that was guilty of no preferences no passions no anguish no divine despair And then there leapt in him a sudden and subtle exultation This splendid comradeship that life was offering to him what could be cried against it what was there that could be condemned It touched no one but their two selves could hurt no one The one woman who might have complained was being robbed of nothing that she desired As for marriage he had tried it and saw that it served a certain need For five years he had lived the life of a celibate and the god in him was master of the beast He thought no such thoughts of Eve She was sunlight perfumes the green gloom of the woods water shining in the moonlight all the music that was and would be all the fairy tales that had been told all the ardour of words spoken in faith She was one whose eyes could quench all the thirsts of his manhood To be with her to be hers was sufficient Canterton was hardly conscious of the physical part of himself as he took a path along one of the cypress walks passed out by a wicket gate and crossed the road into the fir woods Dusk had fallen but there was still a faint grey light under the trees and there was no undergrowth so that one would walk along the woodland aisles as along the aisles of a church A feeling of exultation possessed him The very stillness of the woods the darkness that began to drown all distances were personal and all enveloping A light was shining in one of the lower windows of the little house at Orchards Corner when Canterton came to the gate at the end of the lane He paused there leaning his arms on the gate The blind was up and the curtain undrawn and he could see Eve sitting at a table and bending over a book or writing a letter Canterton crossed the lawn and stood looking in at the lighted window Eve was sitting at the table with her back towards him and he saw the outline of her head and the glow of the light upon her hair She was wearing a blouse cut low at the throat and he could see the white curve of her neck as she bent over the table There were books and papers before her She appeared to be reading and making notes He spoke her name Eve Her profile came sharply against the lamplight Then she pushed the chair back rose and walked to the window The lower sash was up She rested her hands on the sill Is it you The light was behind her and her face vague and shadowy but he had a feeling that she was afraid Her bare white forearms with the hands resting on the window sill looked hard and rigid Have I frightened you Perhaps a little I wanted to talk to you She did not answer him for the moment I am all alone to night I thought you had the girl with you I let her go down to the village He had come to her in a fog of mystical love and through the haze of his vision her set and human face became the one real thing in the world Her voice had a wounded sound and she spoke as from a little distance There was resistance here a bleak dread of something and yet a desire that what was inevitable should be understood You ll forgive me Perhaps I felt I must talk to you As you talked yesterday morning Why not I I thought perhaps that you had understood His full consciousness of all that was in his heart would not suffer him to feel such a thing as shame But a great tenderness reached out to her because he had heard her utter a cry of pain Have I hurt you by coming here She stared beyond him trying to think We were to live like good comrades like fellow artists were we not I told you how the future offers us beautiful friendship She made a little impatient movement I knew it would be difficult while you were talking And now you are making it impossible I cannot see it You are blind with a man s blindness She leant her weight on her arms and bending slightly towards him spoke with peculiar gentleness You look at the horizon you miss the little things Perhaps I am more selfish and near sighted for your sake if not for my own Jim don t make me say what is hateful even to be thought It was the first time that she had called him by the familiar name the name sacred to his lad s days and to the lips of his men friends He stood looking up at her for she was a little above him I like that word Jim But am I blind Hopelessly Can it hurt either of us this comradeship Why Eve child how can I talk all the boyish stuff to you It s bigger finer less selfish than all that I believe I could think of you as I think of Lynette married some day to a good fellow She broke in with sudden passion No you are wrong there utterly wrong Am I wrong everywhere Can t you guess that it hurts terribly all this It s so impossible and you won t see it Let s get back back to yesterday Eve is there ever a yesterday She shivered and drew back a little Jim don t try to come too near me You make me say it You make me say the mean things It s not physical nearness Ah you may think that But you are forgetting all the little people The little people Are we to be little because they are shorter than we are The neighbourhood knows me well enough She came forward again to the window with a kind of tender and stooping pity Jim how very innocent you are Yes I know I know it is precious and perilous Listen Supposing you were to lose Lynette oh why will you make me say the mean hideous things Lose Lynette Do you mean Jim I am going to shut the window He raised an arm Wait Good God No no Good night She closed the window and dragged the curtains across it Canterton stood at gaze a moment before walking away across the grass Eve was listening
