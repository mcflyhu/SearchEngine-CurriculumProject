Run along old lady Daddy s going to write three hundred and seventy nine letters Oh poor daddy And are you going to write to Miss Eve Yes Give her my love and tell her God s been very nice I heard Him promise inside me That s very sensible of God Lynette vanished and Canterton looked across the breakfast table at his wife who was submerged beneath the usual flood of letters She had not been listening had not heard what Lynette had said A local anti suffrage campaign was the passion of the moment It struck Canterton suddenly perhaps for the first time in his life that his wife was a happy woman thoroughly contented with her discontent All this fussy altruism this tumult of affairs gave her the opportunity of full self expression Even her grievances were harmonious chiming in with her passion for restless activity Her egoism was utterly lacking in self criticism If a kettle can be imagined as enjoying itself when it is boiling over Gertrude Canterton s happiness can be understood Gertrude I want to have a talk with you What James I want to have a talk with you She dropped a type written letter on to her plate and looked at him with her pale eyes What is it Something I want you to know Shall we wait and turn into the library I m rushed to death this morning I have to be at Mrs Brocklebank s at ten and All right I ll talk while you finish your breakfast It won t take long She prepared to listen to him with the patient air of an over worked official whose inward eye remains fixed upon insistent accumulations of business It did not strike her that there was anything unusual about his manner or that his voice was the voice of a man who touched the deeper notes of life Eve Carfax is coming back as my secretary and art expert She has given up her work in town I am really very glad James Thanks She got entangled in the militant campaign but the extravagances disgusted her and she broke away Sensible young woman She might help me down here especially as she has some intimate knowledge of the methods of these fanatics It is possible But that is not quite all that I want to tell you In the first place I built the new cottage with the idea that she would come back His wife s face showed vague surprise Did you Don t you think it was a little unnecessary After all We are coming to the point I have a very great affection for Eve Carfax She and I see things together as two humans very rarely see them We were made for the same work She understands the colour of life as I understand it Gertrude Canterton wrinkled up her forehead as though she were puzzled That is very nice for you James It ought to be a help I want you to understand the whole matter thoroughly I am telling you the truth because it seems to me the sane and honest thing to do You and I are not exactly comrades are we We just happen to be married We have our own interests our own friends As a man I have wanted someone who sympathised and understood I am not making this a personal question for I know you do not get much sympathy from me But I have found a comrade That is all His wife sat back in her chair staring Do you mean to say that you are in love with this girl Exactly I am in love with her James how ridiculous Perhaps laughter was the last thing that he had expected but laugh she did with a thin merriment that had no acid edge to it It was the laughter of an egoist who had failed utterly to grasp the significance of what he had said She was too sexless to be jealous too great an egoist to imagine that she was being slighted It appealed to her as a comedy as something quite outside herself How absurd Why you are over forty Just so That makes it more practical I wanted you to realise how things stand and to tell you that I am capable of a higher sort of affection than most people indulge in You have nothing to fear She wriggled her shoulders I don t feel alarmed James in the least I know you would never do common vulgar things You always were eccentric I suppose this is like discovering a new rose It is really funny I only ask you not to make a fool of yourself in public He looked at her steadily and with a kind of compassion My dear Gertrude that is the very point I want to impress upon you I am grimly determined that no one shall be made a fool of least of all you Treat this as absolutely between ourselves She wriggled and poked her chin at him Oh you big eccentric creature Falling in love Somehow it is so quaint that it doesn t make me jealous I suppose I have so many real and absorbing interests that I am rather above such things But I do hope you won t make yourself ridiculous I can promise you that We are to be good friends and fellow workers Only I wanted you to understand Of course I understand I m such a busy woman James and my life is so full that I really haven t time to be sentimental I have heard that most middle aged men get fond of school girls in a fatherly kind of way He crushed his serviette and threw it on the table In a way you are one of the most sensible women Gertrude I have ever met Am I Only you don t realise it It s more temperament than virtue I m a woman of the world James And there are so many important things to do that I haven t time to worry myself about harmless little romances I don t think I mind in the least He pushed back his chair and rose I did not think you would Only we are all egoists more or less One never quite knows how the self in a person will jump He crossed the room and paused at the window looking out His thoughts were that this wife of his was a most amazing fool without sufficient sexual sense to appreciate human nature It was not serene wisdom that had made her take the matter so calmly but sheer egregious fatuity the milk and water mindedness that is incapable of great virtues or great sins Have you thought of Lynette What has Lynette to do with it James Oh nothing He gave her up She was hopeless And yet his contempt made him feel sorry Her hand had gone out to her papers and was stirring them to crepitations that seemed to express the restless satisfactions of her life Don t you over work yourself Gertrude I don t think so But sometimes I do feel You ought to have a secretary some capable young woman who could sit and write letters for eight hours a day I can easily allow you another three hundred a year She flushed He had touched the one vital part in her Oh James I could do so much more And there is so much to be done My postage alone is quite an item Of course Then it s settled I m glad I thought of it James it s
