Mr Charles Stewart the Writer dwelt at the top of the longest stair that ever mason set a hand to fifteen flights of it no less and when I had come to his door and a clerk had opened it and told me his master was within I had scarce breath enough to send my porter packing Awa east and wast wi ye said I took the money bag out of his hands and followed the clerk in The outer room was an office with the clerk s chair at a table spread with law papers In the inner chamber which opened from it a little brisk man sat poring on a deed from which he scarce raised his eyes upon my entrance indeed he still kept his finger in the place as though prepared to show me out and fall again to his studies This pleased me little enough and what pleased me less I thought the clerk was in a good posture to overhear what should pass between us I asked if he was Mr Charles Stewart the Writer The same says he and if the question is equally fair who may you be yourself You never heard tell of my name nor of me [pg ]either said I but I bring you a token from a friend that you know well That you know well I repeated lowering my voice but maybe are not just so keen to hear from at this present being And the bits of business that I have to propone to you are rather in the nature of being confidential In short I would like to think we were quite private He rose without more words casting down his paper like a man ill pleased sent forth his clerk of an errand and shut to the house door behind him Now sir said he returning speak out your mind and fear nothing though before you begin he cries out I tell you mine misgives me I tell you beforehand ye re either a Stewart or a Stewart sent ye A good name it is and one it would ill become my father s son to lightly But I begin to grue at the sound of it My name is called Balfour said I David Balfour of Shaws As for him that sent me I will let his token speak And I showed the silver button Put it in your pocket sir cries he Ye need name no names The deevil s buckie I ken the button of him And de il hae t Where is he now I told him I knew not where Alan was but he had some sure place or thought he had about the north side where he was to lie until a ship was found for him and how and where he had appointed to be spoken with [pg ] It s been always my opinion that I would hang in a tow for this family of mine he cried and dod I believe the day s come now Get a ship for him quot he And who s to pay for it The man s daft That is my part of the affair Mr Stewart said I Here is a bag of good money and if more be wanted more is to be had where it came from I needn t ask your politics said he Ye need not said I smiling for I m as big a Whig as grows Stop a bit stop a bit says Mr Stewart What s all this A Whig Then why are you here with Alan s button and what kind of a black foot traffic is this that I find ye out in Mr Whig Here is a forfeited rebel and an accused murderer with two hundred pounds on his life and ye ask me to meddle in his business and then tell me ye re a Whig I have no mind of any such Whigs before though I ve kent plenty of them He s a forfeited rebel the more s the pity said I for the man s my friend I can only wish he had been better guided And an accused murderer that he is too for his misfortune but wrongfully accused I hear you say so said Stewart More than you are to hear me say so before long said I Alan Breck is innocent and so is James Oh says he the two cases hang together If Alan is out James can never be in [pg ]Hereupon I told him briefly of my acquaintance with Alan of the accident that brought me present at the Appin murder and the various passages of our escape among the heather and my recovery of my estate So sir you have now the whole train of these events I went on and can see for yourself how I come to be so much mingled up with the affairs of your family and friends which for all of our sakes I wish had been plainer and less bloody You can see for yourself too that I have certain pieces of business depending which were scarcely fit to lay before a lawyer chosen at random No more remains but to ask if you will undertake my service I have no great mind to it but coming as you do with Alan s button the choice is scarcely left me said he What are your instructions he added and took up his pen The first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this country said I but I need not be repeating that I am little likely to forget it said Stewart The next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny I went on It would be ill for me to find a conveyance but that should be no stick to you It was two pounds five shillings and three halfpence farthing sterling He noted it Then said I there s a Mr Henderland a licensed preacher and missionary in Ardgour that I would like [pg ]well to get some snuff into the hands of and as I daresay you keep touch with your friends in Appin so near by it s a job you could doubtless overtake with the other How much snuff are we to say he asked I was thinking of two pounds said I Two said he Then there s the lass Alison Hastie in Limekilns said I Her that helped Alan and me across the Forth I was thinking if I could get her a good Sunday gown such as she could wear with decency in her degree it would be an ease to my conscience for the mere truth is we owe her our two lives I am glad to see you are thrifty Mr Balfour says he making his notes I would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune said I And now if you will compute the outlay and your own proper charges I would be glad to know if I could get some spending money back It s not that I grudge the whole of it to get Alan safe it s not that I lack more but having drawn so much the one day I think it would have a very ill appearance if I was back again seeking the next Only be sure you have enough I added for I am very undesirous to meet with you again Well and I m pleased to see you re cautious too said the Writer But I think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum at my discretion [pg ]He said this with a plain sneer I ll have to run the hazard I replied O and there s another service I would ask and that s to direct me to a lodging for I have no roof to my head But it must be a lodging I may seem to have hit upon by accident for it would never do if the Lord Advocate were to get any jealousy of our acquaintance Ye may set your weary spirit at rest said he I will never name your name sir and it s my belief the Advocate is still so much to be sympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence I saw I had got to the wrong side of the man There s a braw day coming for him then said I for he ll have to learn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than to morrow when I call on him When ye call on him repeated Mr Stewart Am I daft or are you What takes ye near the Advocate O just to give myself up said I Mr Balfour he cried are ye making a mock of me No sir said I though I think you have allowed yourself some such freedom with myself But I give you to understand once and for all that I am in no jesting spirit Nor yet me says Stewart And I give you to understand if that s to be the word that I like the looks of your behaviour less and less You come here to [pg ]me with all sorts of propositions which will put me in a train of very doubtful acts and bring me among very undesirable persons this many a day to come And then you tell me you re going straight out of my office to make your peace with the Advocate Alan s button here or Alan s button there the four quarters of Alan wouldnae bribe me further in I would take it with a little more temper said I and perhaps we can avoid what you object to I can see no way for it but to give myself up but perhaps you can see another and if you could I could never deny but what I would be rather relieved For I think my traffic with his lordship is little likely to agree with my health There s just the one thing clear that I have to give my evidence for I hope it ll save Alan s character what s left of it and James s neck which is the more immediate He was silent for a breathing space and then My man said he you ll never be allowed to give such evidence We ll have to see about that said I I m stiff necked when I like Ye muckle ass cried Stewart it s James they want James has got to hang Alan too if they could catch him but James whatever Go near the Advocate with any such business and you ll see he ll find a way to muzzle ye I think better of the Advocate than that said I [pg ] The Advocate be damned cries he It s the Campbells man You ll have the whole clanjamfry of them on your back and so will the Advocate too poor body It s extraordinar ye cannot see where ye stand If there s no fair way to stop your gab there s a foul one gaping They can put ye in the dock do ye no see that he cried and stabbed me with one finger in the leg Ay said I I was told that same no further back than this morning by another lawyer And who was he asked Stewart He spoke sense at least I told I must be excused from naming him for he was a decent stout old Whig and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs I think all the world seems to be mixed up in it cries Stewart But what said you I told him what had passed between Rankeillor and myself before the house of Shaws Well and so ye will hang said he Ye ll hang beside James Stewart There s your fortune told I hope better of it yet than that said I but I could never deny there was a risk Risk says he and then sat silent again I ought to thank you for your staunchness to my friends to whom you show a very good spirit he says if you have the strength to stand by it But I warn you that you re wading deep I wouldn t put myself in your [pg ]place me that s a Stewart born for all the Stewarts that ever there were since Noah Risk ay I take over many but to be tried in court before a Campbell jury and a Campbell judge and that in a Campbell country and upon a Campbell quarrel think what you like of me Balfour it s beyond me It s a different way of thinking I suppose said I I was brought up to this one by my father before me Glory to his bones he has left a decent son to his name says he Yet I would not have you judge me over sorely My case is dooms hard See sir ye tell me ye re a Whig I wonder what I am No Whig to be sure I couldnae be just that But laigh in your ear man I m maybe no very keen on the other side Is that a fact cried I It s what I would think of a man of your intelligence Hut none of your whillywhas [ ] cries he There s intelligence upon both sides But for my private part I have no particular desire to harm King George and as for King James God bless him he does very well for me across the water I m a lawyer ye see fond of my books and my bottle a good plea a well drawn deed a crack in the Parliament House with other lawyer bodies and perhaps a turn at the golf on a Saturday at e en Where do ye come in with your Hieland plaids and claymores [pg ] Well said I it s a fact ye have little of the wild Highlandman Little quoth he Nothing man And yet I m Hieland born and when the clan pipes who but me has to dance The clan and the name that goes by all It s just what you said yourself my father learned it to me and a bonny trade I have of it Treason and traitors and the smuggling of them out and in and the French recruiting weary fall it and the smuggling through of the recruits and their pleas a sorrow of their pleas Here haye I been moving one for young Ardshiel my cousin claimed the estate under the marriage contract a forfeited estate I told them it was nonsense muckle they cared And there was I cocking behind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself for it was fair ruin to the pair of us a black mark disaffected branded on our hurdies like folk s names upon their kye And what can I do I m a Stewart ye see and must fend for my clan and family Then no later by than yesterday there was one of our Stewart lads carried to the Castle What for I ken fine Act of recruiting for King Lewie And you ll see he ll whistle me in to be his lawyer and there ll be another black mark on my chara ter I tell you fair if I but kent the heid of a Hebrew word from the hurdies of it be dammed but I would fling the whole thing up and turn minister [pg ] It s rather a hard position said I Dooms hard cries he And that s what makes me think so much of ye you that s no Stewart to stick your head so deep in Stewart business And for what I do not know unless it was the sense of duty I hope it will be that said I Well says he it s a grand quality But here is my clerk back and by your leave we ll pick a bit of dinner all the three of us When that s done I ll give you the direction of a very decent man that ll be very fain to have you for a lodger And I ll fill your pockets to ye forbye out of your ain bag For this business ll not be near as dear as ye suppose not even the ship part of it I made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing Hoot ye neednae mind for Robbie cries he A Stewart too puir deevil and has smuggled out more French recruits and trafficking Papists than what he has hairs upon his face Why it s Robin that manages that branch of my affairs Who will we have now Rob for across the water There ll be Andie Scougal in the Thristle replied Rob I saw Hoseason the other day but it seems he s wanting the ship Then there ll be Tarn Stobo but I m none so sure of Tam I ve seen him colloguing with some gey queer acquaintances and if [pg ]it was anybody important I would give Tam the go by The head s worth two hundred pounds Robin said Stewart Gosh that ll no be Alan Breck cried the clerk Just Alan said his master Weary winds that s sayrious cried Robin I ll try Andie then Andie ll be the best It seems it s quite a big business I observed Mr Balfour there s no end to it said Stewart There was a name your clerk mentioned I went on Hoseason That must be my man I think Hoseason of the brig Covenant Would you set your trust on him He didnae behave very well to you and Alan said Mr Stewart but my mind of the man in general is rather otherwise If he had taken Alan on board his ship on an agreement it s my notion he would have proved a just dealer How say ye Rob No more honest skipper in the trade than Eli said the clerk I would lippen to[ ] Eli s word ay if it was the Chevalier or Appin himsel he added And it was him that brought the doctor wasnae t asked the master He was the very man said the clerk And I think he took the doctor back says Stewart [pg ] Ay with his sporran
