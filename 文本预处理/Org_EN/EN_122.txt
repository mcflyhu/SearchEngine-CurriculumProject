I was put in charge of the captain of the North German Lloyd S S Donau and after a most terrific cyclone in mid ocean in which we nearly foundered I landed in Hoboken sixteen days from Bremen My brother Harry Dunham met me on the pier saying as he took me in his arms You do not need to tell me what sort of a trip you have had it is enough to look at the ship that tells the story As the vessel had been about given up for lost her arrival was somewhat of an agreeable surprise to all our friends and to none more so than my old friend Jack a second lieutenant of the United States army who seemed so glad to have me back in America that I concluded the only thing to do was to join the army myself A quiet wedding in the country soon followed my decision and we set out early in April of the year to join his regiment which was stationed at Fort Russell Cheyenne Wyoming Territory I had never been west of New York and Cheyenne seemed to me in contrast with the finished civilization of Europe which I had so recently left the wildest sort of a place Arriving in the morning and alighting from the train two gallant officers in the uniform of the United States infantry approached and gave us welcome and to me the bride a special welcome to the regiment was given by each of them with outstretched hands Major Wilhelm said The ambulance is right here you must come to our house and stay until you get your quarters Such was my introduction to the army and to the army ambulance in which I was destined to travel so many miles Four lively mules and a soldier driver brought us soon to the post and Mrs Wilhelm welcomed us to her pleasant and comfortable looking quarters I had never seen an army post in America I had always lived in places which needed no garrison and the army except in Germany was an unknown quantity to me Fort Russell was a large post and the garrison consisted of many companies of cavalry and infantry It was all new and strange to me Soon after luncheon Jack said to Major Wilhelm Well now I must go and look for quarters what s the prospect You will have to turn some one out said the Major as they left the house together About an hour afterwards they returned and Jack said Well I have turned out Lynch but he added as his wife and child are away I do not believe he ll care very much Oh said I I m so sorry to have to turn anybody out The Major and his wife smiled and the former remarked You must not have too much sympathy it s the custom of the service it s always done by virtue of rank They ll hate you for doing it but if you don t do it they ll not respect you After you ve been turned out once yourself you will not mind turning others out The following morning I drove over to Cheyenne with Mrs Wilhelm and as I passed Lieutenant Lynch s quarters and saw soldiers removing Mrs Lynch s lares and penates in the shape of a sewing machine lamp shades and other home like things I turned away in pity that such customs could exist in our service To me who had lived my life in the house in which I was born moving was a thing to be dreaded But Mrs Wilhelm comforted me and assured me it was not such a serious matter after all Army women
