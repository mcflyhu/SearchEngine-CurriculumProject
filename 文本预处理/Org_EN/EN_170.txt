When the door closed on her Terry remained standing in the middle of the room watching the flame in the oil lamp she had lighted flare and rise at the corner and then steady down to an even line of yellow but he was not seeing it he was listening to that peculiar silence in the house It seemed to have spread over the entire village and he heard no more of those casual noises which he had noticed on his coming He went to the window and raised it to let whatever wind was abroad enter the musty warmth of the room He raised the sash with stealthy caution wondering at his own stealthiness And he was oddly glad when the window rose without a squeak He leaned out and looked up and down the street It was unchanged Across the way a door flung open a child darted out with shrill laughter and dodged about the corner of the house escaping after some mischief After that the silence again except that before long a murmur began on the veranda beneath him where the half dozen obscure figures had been sitting when he entered Why should they be mumbling to themselves He thought he could distinguish the voice of the widow Rickson among the rest but he shrugged that idle thought away and turned back into his room He sat down on the side of the bed and pulled off his boots but the minute they were off he was ill at ease There was something oppressive about the atmosphere of this rickety old hotel What sort of a world was this he had entered with its whispers its cold glances He cast himself back on his bed determined to be at ease Nevertheless his heart kept bumping absurdly Now Terry began to grow angry With the feeling that there was danger in the air of Craterville for him there came a nervous setting of the muscles a desire to close on someone and throttle the secret of this hostility At this point he heard a light tapping at the door Terry sat bolt upright on the bed There are all kinds of taps There are bold heavy blows on the door that mean danger without there are careless conversational rappings but this was a furtive tap repeated after a pause as though it contained a code message First there was a leap of fear then cold quiet of the nerves He was surprised at himself He found himself stepping into whatever adventure lay toward him with the lifting of the spirits It was a stimulus He called cheerfully Come in And the moment he had spoken he was off the bed noiselessly and half the width of the room away It had come to him as he spoke that it might be well to shift from the point from which his voice had been heard The door opened swiftly so swiftly was it opened and closed that it made a faint whisper in the air oddly like a sigh And there was no click of the lock either in the opening or the closing Which meant an incalculably swift and dexterous manipulation with the fingers Terry found himself facing a short throated man with heavy shoulders he wore a shapeless black hat bunched on his head as though the whole hand had grasped the crown and shoved the hat into place It sat awkwardly to one side And the hat typified the whole man There was a sort of shifty readiness about him His eyes flashed in the lamplight as they glanced at the bed and then flicked back toward Terry And a smile began somewhere in his face and instantly went out It was plain that he had understood the maneuver He continued to survey Terry insolently for a moment without announcing himself Then he stated You re him all right Am I said Terry regarding this unusual visitor with increasing suspicion But I m afraid you have me at a disadvantage The big shouldered man raised a stubby hand He had an air of one who deprecates and at the same time lets another into a secret He moved across the room with short steps that made no sound and gave him a peculiar appearance of drifting rather than walking He picked up a chair and placed it down on the rug beside the bed and seated himself in it Aside from the words he had spoken since he entered the room he had made no more noise than a phantom You re him all right he repeated balancing back in the chair But he gathered his toes under him so that he remained continually poised in spite of the seeming awkwardness of his position Who am I asked Terry Why Black Jack s kid It s printed in big type all over you His keen eyes continued to bore at Terry as though he were striving to read features beneath a mask Terry could see his visitor s face more clearly now It was square with a powerfully muscled jaw and features that had a battered look Suddenly he teetered forward in his chair and dropped his elbows aggressively on his knees D you know what they re talking about downstairs Haven t the slightest idea You ain t The old lady is trying to fix up a bad time for you She s raising a crowd Doing her best I dunno what it ll come to The boys are stirring a little But I think it ll be all words and no action Four flushers most of em Besides they say you bumped old Minter for a goal and they don t like the idea of messing up with you They ll just talk If they try anything besides their talk well you and me can fix em Terry slipped into the only other chair which the room provided but he slid far down in it so that his holster was free and the gun butt conveniently under his hand You seem a charitable sort he said Why do you throw in with me And you don t know who I am said the other He chuckled noiselessly his mouth stretching to remarkable proportions I m sorry said Terry Why kid I m Denver I m your old man s pal Denver I m him that done the Silver Junction job with old Black Jack and a lot more jobs when you come to that He laughed again They were getting sort of warm for me out in the big noise So I grabbed me a side door Pullman and took a trip out to the old beat And think of bumping into Black Jack s boy right off the bat He became more sober Say kid ain t you got a glad hand for me Ain t you ever heard Black Jack talk He died said Terry soberly before I was a year old The hell murmured the other The hell Poor kid That was a rotten lay all right If I d known about that I d of but I didn t Well let it go Here we are together And you re the sort of a sidekick I need Black Jack we re going to trim this town to a fare thee well My name is Hollis said Terry Terence Hollis Terence hell snorted the other You re Black Jack s kid ain t you And ain t his moniker good enough for you to work under Why kid that s a trademark most of us would give ten thousand cash for He broke off and regarded Terry with a growing satisfaction You re his kid all right This is just the way Black Jack would of sat cool as ice with a gang under him talking about stretching his neck And now bo hark to me sing I got the job fixed and But wait a minute What you been doing all these years Black Jack was known when he was your age With a peculiar thrill of awe and of aversion Terry watched the face of the man who had known his father so well He tried to make himself believe that twenty four years ago Denver might have been quite another type of man But it was impossible to re create that face other than as a bulldog in the human flesh The craft and the courage of a fighter were written large in those features I ve been leading a quiet life he said gently The other grinned Sure quiet he chuckled And then you wake up and bust Minter for your first crack You began late son but you may go far Pretty tricky with the gat eh He nodded in anticipatory admiration Old Minter had a name Ain t I had my run in with him He was smooth with a cannon And fast as a snake s tongue But they say you beat him fair and square Well well I call that a snappy start in the world Terry was silent but his companion refused to be chilled That s Black Jack over again he said No wind about what he d done No jabber about what he was going to do But when you wanted something done go to Black Jack Bam There it was done clean for you and no talk afterward Oh he was a bird was your old man And you take after him right enough A voice rose in Terry He wanted to argue He wanted to explain It was not that he felt any consuming shame because he was the son of Black Jack Hollis But there was a sort of foster parenthood to which he owed a clean minded allegiance the fiction of the Colby blood He had worshipped that thought for twenty years He could not discard it in an instant Denver was breezing on in his quick husky voice so carefully toned that it barely served to reach Terry I been waiting for a pal like you kid And here s where we hit it off You don t know much about the game I guess Neither did Black Jack As a peterman he was a loud ha ha as a damper getter he was just an amateur as a heel or a houseman well them things were just outside him When it come to the gorilla stuff he was there a million though And when there was a call for fast quick soft work Black Jack was the man Kid I can see that you re cut right on his pattern And here s where you come in with me Right off the bat there s going to be velvet Later on I ll educate you In three months you ll be worth your salt Are you on He hardly waited for Terry to reply He rambled on I got a plant that can t fail to blossom into the long green kid The store safe You know what s in it I ll tell you Ten thousand cold Ten thousand bucks boy Well well and how did it get there Because a lot of the boobs around here have put their spare cash in the safe for safekeeping He tilted his chin and indulged in another of his yawning silent bursts of laughter And you never seen a peter like it Tin kid tin I could turn it inside out with a can opener But I ain t long on a kit just now I m on the hog for fair as a matter of fact Well I don t need a kit I got some sawdust and I can make the soup as pretty as you ever seen We ll blow the safe kid and then we ll float Are you on He paused grinning with expectation his face gradually becoming blank as he saw no response in Terry As nearly as I can make out because most of the slang is new to me said Terry you want to dynamite the store safe and Who said sawdust Soup kid soup I want to blow the door off the peter not the roof off the house Say who d you think I am a boob I understand then Nitroglycerin Denver I m not with you It s mighty good of you to ask me to join in but that isn t my line of work The yegg raised an expostulatory hand but Terry went on I m going to keep straight Denver It seemed as though this simple tiding took the breath from Denver Ah he nodded at length You playing up a new line No strong arm stuff except when you got to use it Going to try scratching kid Is that it or some other kind of slick stuff I mean what I say Denver I m going straight The yegg shook his head bewildered Say he burst out suddenly ain t you Black Jack s kid I m his son said Terry All right You ll come to it It s in the blood Black Jack You can t get away from it Terry tugged his shirt open at the throat he was stifling Perhaps he said It s the easy way went on Denver Well maybe you ain t ripe yet but when you are tip me off Gimme a ring and I ll be with you One more thing You re broke Denver And I suppose you need what s in that safe But if you take it the widow will be ruined She runs the hotel and the store too you know Why you poor boob groaned Denver don t you know she s the old dame that s trying to get you mobbed I suppose so But she was pretty fond of the sheriff you know I don t blame her for carrying a grudge Now about the money Denver I happen to have a little with me Take what you want Denver took the proffered money without a word counted it with a deftly stabbing forefinger and shoved the wad into his hip pocket All right he said this ll sort of sweeten the pot You don t need it I ll get along without it And you won t break the safe Hell grunted Denver Does it hang on that Terry leaned forward in his chair Denver don t break that safe You kind of say that as if you was boss maybe sneered Denver I am said Terry as far as this goes How ll you stop me kid Sit up all night and nurse the safe No But I ll follow you Denver And I ll get you You understand I ll stay on your trail till I have you Again there was a long moment of silence then Black Jack muttered Denver You re like his ghost I think you d get me right enough Well I ll call it off This fifty will help me along a ways At the door he whirled sharply on Terence Hollis How much have you got left he asked Enough said Terry Then lemme have another fifty will you I m sorry I can t quite manage it Make it twenty five then Can t do that either Denver I m very sorry Hell man Are you a short sport I got a long jump before me Ain t you got any credit around this town I not very much I m afraid You re kidding me scowled Denver That wasn t Black Jack s way From his shoes to his skin everything he had belonged to his partners His ghost ll haunt you if you re turning me down kid Why ain t you the heir of a rich rancher over the hills Ain t that what I been told I was said Terry until today Ah You got turned out for beaning Minter Terry remained silent Without a cent Suddenly the pudgy arm of Denver shot out and his finger pointed into Terry s face You damn fool This fifty is the last cent you got in the world Not at all said Terry calmly You lie Denver struck his knuckles across his forehead And I was going to trim you Black Jack I didn t know you was as white as this Fifty Pal take it back He forced the money into Terry s pocket And take some more Here lemme stake you I been pulling a sob story but I m in the clover Black Jack Gimme your last cent will you Kid here s a hundred two hundred say what you want Not a cent nothing said Terry but he was deeply moved Denver thoughtfully restored the money to his wallet You re white he said gently And you re straight as they come Keep it up if you can I know damned well that you can t I ve seen em try before But they always slip Keep it up Black Jack but
