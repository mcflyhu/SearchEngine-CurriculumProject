A painted butterfly Audrey s lip curled at the phrase It exactly described the kind of woman her father s animal nature would be drawn to In her mind s eye she saw the pathetic figure of her mother trying to recover her faded prettiness with Madame Coralie s assistance so as to win back a love that required to be stimulated by mere beauty of form and face And a music hall artist Is she respectable asked Audrey suddenly Oh quite said Mrs Mellop laughing artificially But I wonder why you ask Oh I merely heard her name answered Audrey quietly Why do you laugh Mrs Mellop tried to stop tittering Oh my dear I can see it all she said gaily your face betrays you To think that he should run after her He Who asked Audrey drawing up her slight figure and wincing at the thought that this gossiping woman was about to pronounce her father s name Why Mr Shawe of course Mr Shawe The girl grew violently red He doesn t run after Miss Pearl Oh I know he loves you dear said the widow in a tantalising way Anyone can see that when he s in the room and everyone knows that he is as good as engaged to you although your father won t hear of your marrying the poor man But she made a gesture of contempt he s a man after all Have you any ground to say that Mr Shawe runs after Only your face dear and your strong desire to know about Miss Pearl If that is all said Audrey with quiet scorn you can exonerate Ralph from being an admirer of Miss Pearl I know that he is true to me And you call him Ralph said her visitor glibly my dear what will your father say He wants you to marry Lord Anvers What That puny little racing man He has never said anything to me about it Mrs Mellop and if he does I shall certainly refuse to entertain the idea And since you have hinted that all the world knows my business she went on looking the widow straight in the face you can inform everyone on my authority that I intend to marry Mr Shawe and that we are engaged With your father s consent dear Never mind Audrey was glad to see that Mrs Mellop s attention had been taken off the name of Rosy Pearl as she did not want for obvious reasons to talk about the lady My father and I understand one another Oh I dare say dear but do your father and Mr Shawe understand one another I m sure I hope so as it means so much money to Mr Shawe Ralph marries me for myself and not for my money said the girl hotly No doubt dear but he s got an eye to the main chance like the rest of us Audrey again looked straightly at the pretty artificial frivolous face I think not she said coolly Ralph is not like other men Ah Mrs Mellop became serious we all think men are angels until we marry them dear And this Rosy Pearl attracts She doesn t attract Ralph interrupted Miss Branwin resolutely and saw the necessity of drawing another red herring across the trail I told you that I merely asked about her because the name had struck my fancy And now I have to give you a message from my father Yes dear said Mrs Mellop anxiously for now that Sir Joseph was a widower she had a sudden vision of possible matrimony He has gone to Brighton for a week or so since the doctor has ordered him the sea air He told me to ask you to chaperon me while he was absent as he does not like the idea of my being alone But I am afraid you will find it rather dull here I am in mourning you know The widow gasped with delight That Sir Joseph should select her from amongst all his friends to stay at Camden Hill as a temporary companion to his only daughter surely showed that he took a deep interest in her and such interest could only mean that marriage Oh cried Mrs Mellop shutting her eyes to conjure up more clearly the golden vision how sweet of you I like a quiet time as my poor husband did not leave me very well off and it is so expensive to go about in London besides your darling mother was a good friend to me and my heart is wrung Audrey knew perfectly well that Lady Branwin had been a very good friend indeed to Mrs Mellop who was something of a parasite and knew also that the lady s heart was not wrung in the least She had used the phrase because it sounded well and because she wished to ingratiate herself with the heiress Not that Mrs Mellop was a bad hearted woman She was simply frivolous and incapable of feeling any deep emotion In her own silly way she had been attached to the late Lady Branwin because she had found her a useful friend In the same way she was prepared to lavish her shallow affections on Audrey Mrs Mellop duly arrived with many boxes and was given a charming suite of apartments luxuriously furnished with all that civilisation could provide in the way of comfort Certainly the life was somewhat quiet as Audrey rarely left the grounds and even when in the house preferred to be alone with her books and music But the surroundings were costly the food was excellent and there were innumerable servants ready to obey the widow s beck and call Mrs Mellop during her three weeks stay felt that she was already the wife of the millionaire and took advantage of the opportunity to go out daily in one of the luxurious motor cars to shop extensively and run up many bills on the assumption that Sir Joseph would certainly pay them when he proposed And the shopkeepers who hitherto had been rather shy of the pretty little widow trusted her readily when they knew that she was chaperoning Miss Branwin and saw that she used Sir Joseph s up to date vehicles Also she might have dropped a hint or two that she had come to stay at the Camden Hill house But at all events during that halcyon time Mrs Mellop assuredly gathered together a wardrobe and a quantity of jewellery which stood her in good service afterwards when the gates of this millionaire Eden closed behind her But as yet she never believed that they would close or if they did that she would be within as the second Lady Branwin Meanwhile since the chaperon was discreet and Sir Joseph was at the seaside Audrey saw a great deal of Ralph Because of her mourning for her mother she could not meet him as usual in Kensington Gardens but he came to afternoon tea and sometimes to dinner Mrs Mellop only too anxious to get Audrey married so that she could prosecute her matrimonial plans when the millionaire returned was rarely present at these meetings or if she was speedily got out of the way on the plea of fatigue or that she had to write letters Audrey might have had no chaperon so far as Mrs Mellop was concerned and it was evident that the little widow had taken the hint given by the girl at that first candid interview But Mrs Mellop wrote Sir Joseph gushing letters about his sweet child without mentioning the almost constant presence of the young barrister Audrey and Ralph did not talk like lovers now The girl was consumed by a fierce desire to hunt down the assassin of her mother and talked of little else but the chance of tracing the murderer Ralph assured her that he had kept in touch with Inspector Lanton and with the police generally to say nothing of his frequent visits to the detectives at Scotland Yard But nothing can be found out said the barrister sadly Something must be found out cried Audrey at the last of these interviews and if the police fail we must succeed But your father Audrey made a gesture of contempt My father thinks that he has done his duty by offering this thousand pounds reward He will not lift a finger to find the assassin of my poor mother He is glad she is dead Oh surely not remarked Ralph rather shocked by this blunt speech Surely yes said the girl bitterly I did not tell you before Ralph because I was ashamed to tell you but my father is going to marry again Shawe was startled Mrs Mellop he asked after a bewildered pause No Although his mere invitation to Mrs Mellop that she should be my chaperon has caused her to entertain ideas of marriage Do you know Rosy Pearl The music hall dancer Yes Well she is to be the future Lady Branwin Oh Audrey cried Shawe greatly astonished you must be mistaken I had the information from my father s own lips insisted Audrey What do you know of this woman Very little She is a handsome woman in the style of Juno and is a wonderful dancer I heard that Sir Joseph had been paying attentions to her but I did not dream that he contemplated marriage with her He does then Mrs Mellop calls her a painted butterfly She s a very substantial butterfly said Shawe with the ghost of a smile for Audrey was too much in earnest to tolerate lightness of any sort And I believe she is rather a respectable woman Such a woman as should stand in the place of my dead mother asked Audrey looking searchingly at his face No rejoined Ralph promptly And yet I can t say that I have heard a word against Rosy Pearl I simply mean that you would not like one who had been a dancer to be your stepmother I certainly should not said Audrey decisively and yet if I object my father as he hinted is quite capable of turning me out of doors He will do that in any case unless I marry Lord Anvers What Shawe flushed That little reptile who I know a great deal about him said Audrey cutting him short and I do not wish to hear any more I shall leave this house rather than marry him and rather than see this Pearl woman occupying my mother s place Come to me darling said Ralph holding out his arms Let us get married at once and defy your father I should lose my money then dear Oh what does that matter I want you and not your money Dear she placed her hands on his shoulders and looked deeply into his keen grey eyes now filled with the love light I am too fond of you to allow you to ruin yourself for my sake Ruin myself his arms slipped round her waist and he placed his cheek against hers how could you do that you silly darling Very easily she replied in a tired voice for all she had gone through was wearing her out You have just enough money to get along with as a bachelor But what is enough for one is not enough for two in spite of the proverb If I married you in haste we should both repent at leisure Not only would we be poor but my father being thwarted would do his best to hinder you He could not do that declared Shawe who believed that he was capable of defying the world much less Sir Joseph Oh yes he could and he would He would use his money and his influence to prevent any solicitor giving you a brief He would turn people against you and would give you a bad name I know my father s hard nature and his pertinacious way of following up things My poor mother told me how he had ruined and disgraced several people who had crossed his path Ralph pushed her slightly away from him and taking her hands looked into her eyes And do you think that I am ready to give you up because your father would act in this way he demanded I am not afraid of Sir Joseph or of any man Two people can play at every game and if your father tries to crush me he will find that I am not a man to be cast out of his path If he has money I have brains and I am quite willing to pit my intellect against his wealth Hang Sir Joseph and a dozen like him I beg your pardon dear for after all he is your father A father in name only said Audrey admiring her lover s indignation which was righteous and masterful in her eyes You know what I think of him Ralph I wish I had a better opinion of his nature but my experience and my mother s experience what she has told me show that my father is a hard man with a strong will He does not care what anyone suffers so long as he gets his way The mere fact that he has already decided to marry again and marry a music hall artist shows how callous he is It s like Hamlet s mother ended Audrey bitterly with the funeral baked meats not yet cold as in the play Ralph took a turn up and down the room with a frowning brow and looking deeply perplexed What s to be done then he demanded stopping before the girl Things can t go on in this way You won t marry me For your own sake I won t marry you at present interpolated the girl Audrey you say that your father intends to marry Rosy Pearl as soon as he possibly can without shocking public opinion When he does you can t stay in the house as you declare and also you say that you will not marry Lord Anvers Your father so you tell me is bound to turn you out if you refuse to obey him so it seems to me that the evil day is only postponed for a few months I daresay Ralph But much may happen in a few months For one thing we you and I may find out who killed my mother And even if you had money and could offer me a home I should refuse to marry you until that truth comes to light But it s impossible and after all can do little good It s not impossible and can at least punish the assassin No one but myself cares for my poor mother s memory and I must avenge her death Come dear she placed her arms round his neck you will be my knight errant Yes said Ralph promptly and kissed her But where shall I begin
