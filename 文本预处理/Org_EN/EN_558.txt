It was dark when Rose reached home She had walked rapidly mechanically taking familiar turns cresting the long slope of the hill at a panting speed rounding corners where gushes of light revealed her as a dark flitting figure hurrying by almost at a run She was as oblivious to her surroundings as Berny left motionless on the park bench Never before in her life had anything like this touched her Such few troubles as she had known had been those of a sheltered domestic life the life of a cherished child whose dainty self respect had never been blurred by a coarse breath Now had come this horrible revelation It shook the pretty world she had lived in like an earthquake Idols lay broken in the dust She had often seen her father rough and brutal as he was to Gene but that was a different thing to her father s buying that wretched woman s husband buying him for her Berny s face rose upon the darkness with its pitiful assumption of jaunty bravado its[ ] mean shrewishness under the coating of powder and rouge How could they do it the girl panted to herself How could they ever do such a thing She did not suspect Dominick She could not have believed he was party to such an action unless he had told her so with his own lips As she hurried on the thought that this was the woman he had bound himself to for the rest of his life mingled with the other more poignantly hateful thoughts with a last sickening sense of wretchedness The sudden aghast consciousness of chaos of an abrupt demolishing of the pleasant familiar settings of a life that never comes to some came to Rose that evening as she ran home through the fog She entered the house noiselessly and sped up to her room It was time to dress for dinner and an old woman servant who had once been her nurse was waiting to help her The mistress and maid were on terms of affectionate intimacy and the progress of the toilet was generally enlivened by gossip and laughter To night the girl was singularly silent responding with monosyllables and sometimes not at all to the remarks of her assistant As the woman drew the fastenings of the dress together she could feel that the body the gown clipped so closely quivered like the casing of machinery vibrating to powerful concussions within [ ]The silence that continued to hold her throughout dinner passed unnoticed as Gene was there and enlivened the passage of the meal by contributing an almost unbroken stream of talk The night before he had been to a play the plot of which and its development in four acts he now related with a fullness of detail which testified to the closeness of his attention and the accuracy of his memory As each course was removed from the table and the young man could once more give his undivided attention to the matter of discourse he leaned back in his chair and took up the dropped thread with a fresh zest and some such remarks as In the beginning of the next act the hero comes in with his hat on and first he says and so on With each of these renewals of the narrative the Bonanza King subsided against his chair back in a limp attitude staring with gloomy fixity at his boy and expelling his breath in a long audible rush of air which was sometimes a sigh and sometimes approached the proportions of a groan At the end of dinner when Gene announced his intention of leaving as he was to attend a vaudeville performance the old man began to show signs of reviving animation going so far as politely to ask his son where he was going and with whom His manner was marked by a warm hearty encouragement as he said [ ] Get the whole vaudeville program down by heart Gene and you can tell it to us to morrow night There ll be about twelve parts to it and Rose can order two extra courses for dinner and we might hire some men with stringed instruments for an accompaniment Gene with innocent good humor responded gaily All right father I ll give it my best attention and if there s anything especially good I ll report to you You and Rose might like to go some night His father disappointed that his shaft had made no impression upon the young man s invulnerable amiability emitted a scornful snort and made no further response to Gene s cheery Good night There he said in tones expressing his relief as the porti re dropped behind his son s departing figure he s gone Now Rosey you and I can have a talk Yes said his daughter looking at her coffee cup that s what I wanted I want to have a long talk with you to night papa Fire away said the old man I ve had to listen to that fool for an hour and it s broken my spirit You can say anything you like Not here said his daughter in the sitting room I ll go in there and wait for you Why not here What s the matter with here [ ] I like it better than the sitting room I m more comfortable No the servants will want to clear the things away and I don t want them to hear what I say Tell the servants to go to hell said the old man who relieved by Gene s departure was becoming more cheerful No this is something something serious I ll go into the sitting room and wait for you When you ve finished your coffee come in She rose from her chair and walked to the door He noticed that she was unusually unsmiling and it occurred to him that she had been so all through dinner What is it honey he said extending his hand toward her short on your allowance Oh no it s just just something she said lifting the porti re Come when you re ready I ll be there She walked up the hall to the sitting room and there sat down in a low chair before the chimneypiece The chill of the fog had penetrated the house and a fire had been kindled in the grate On its quivering fluctuation of flame she fixed her eyes With her hands pressed between her knees she sat immovable thinking of what she was going to say and so nervous that the blood sang in her ears and the palms of her hands clasped tight together were damp She had never in her life shrunk so before an allotted task It sickened[ ] her and she was determined to do it to thresh it out to the end When she heard her father s step in the passage her heart began to beat like a woman s waiting for her lover She straightened herself and drew an inspiration from the bottom of her lungs to try to give herself breath wherewith to speak The old man flung himself into an arm chair at one side of the fireplace jerked a small table to his elbow reached creakingly for an ash tray and having made himself comfortable took his cigar from his mouth and said Well let s hear about this serious matter that s making you look like a tragedy queen It is serious she said slowly It s something that you won t like to hear about Hit me with it he said wondering a little what it could be Gene s gone and a child could eat out of my hand now Looking into the fire Rose said I was out walking this afternoon and down in the union Street plaza a woman stopped me I d never seen her before She was Mrs Dominick Ryan The old man s face became a study A certain whimsical tenderness that was generally in it when he spoke to his daughter vanished as if by magic It was as if a light had gone out He continued to look at her with something of blankness in his countenance as if for the first[ ] moment of shock every faculty was held in suspense waiting for the next words He held his cigar nipped between a pair of stumpy fingers out away from him over the arm of the chair Well he said quietly and what had she to say to you The most disagreeable things I think any one ever said to me in my life If they re true they re just too dreadful she stopped balking from the final disclosure Suppose you tell me what they were he said with the same almost hushed quietness She said that you and Mrs Ryan were offering her money a good deal of money three hundred thousand dollars was the amount I think to leave her husband so that he could get a divorce from her and then she swallowed as if to swallow down this last unbearable indignity and then be free to marry me So Berny had told all If deep unspoken curses could have killed her she would have died that moment Is it true Rose asked Well yes said the old man in a perfectly natural tone of dubious consideration it s a fairly accurate statement Oh papa cried his daughter how could you have done it How could you have done such a thing Such a hateful horrible thing [ ] Horrible thing he repeated with an air of almost na ve astonishment What s horrible about it You know I don t have to tell you you know Don t say to me that you don t think it s horrible Don t make me feel as if we were suddenly thousands of miles apart The Bonanza King knew that in many matters in most matters involving questions of ethics they were more thousands of miles apart than she even now suspected That was one of the reasons why he would have liked to kill Berny who for the first time had brought this dissimilarity in their points of view to his daughter s unwilling consideration He spoke slowly and vaguely to gain time He knew it was a critical moment in the relations between himself and the one creature in the world he loved I don t want you to feel that way dearie he said easily Maybe there are things in this matter you don t know about or understand And anyway what s there so horrible in trying to separate a man and woman who are unhappily married and can t bear the sight of each other You were separating them for me she said in a low voice Well now he answered with a slight rocking movement of his shoulders and a manner of almost bluff deprecation I can say that I wasn t but suppose I was [ ]She paid no attention to the last part of the sentence and replied The woman said you were He did not answer for a minute the truth being that he did not know what it was best to say and wanted to wait and let her make statements that he could either contradict or seek to justify What made you think I wanted to marry Dominick Ryan she said slowly her eyes on the fire This was a question that went to the core of the subject He knew now that he could not put her off or slip from the responsibilities of the occasion Drawing himself to the edge of his chair he leaned forward and spoke with a sincerity and feeling that made his words very impressive One evening when I was at Antelope I came into the sitting room and saw my daughter in the arms of Dominick Ryan I knew that my girl wasn t the woman to let a man do that unless she loved him That was how I came to know Oh said Rose in a faint tone Afterward I heard from Dominick of what his marriage was I heard from his mother too Then I saw his wife and I got a better idea from her what it was than I did from either of the others That fellow the man my daughter cared for was tied up in a marriage that was hell He[ ] was bound to a woman who could only be managed with a club and Dominick was not the kind that uses a club to a woman What liking he d had for her was gone She stuck to him like a barnacle because she wanted to get money was ready to hang on feet and hands till Delia Ryan was dead and then put up a claim for a share of the estate Do you think a man s doing such a horrible thing to break up a marriage like that Yes said Rose I do It was a marriage They d taken each other for better or for worse They d made the most solemn promises to each other Neither you nor any one else had a right to interfere She spoke with a hard determination with something of an inflexible unrelenting positiveness that was very unusual in her which surprised and for the moment silenced her father It rose from a source of conviction deeper than the surface emotions of likes and dislikes of loves and hates of personal satisfactions and disappointments At the core of her being with roots extending through all the ramifications of her mental and moral nature was a belief in the inviolability of the marriage tie It was a conviction founded on neither tradition nor reason nor expediency a thing of impulse of sex an hereditary instinct inherited from generations of virtuous women who in the days of their defenselessness as in the days of their supremacy [ ] knew that the most sacred possessions of their lives their husbands their children their homes rested on its stability All the small individual preoccupations of her love for Dominick her pity for his sufferings were swept aside by this greater feeling that she did not understand or reason about She obeyed an instinct elemental as the instinct of motherhood when she refused to admit his right to break the bond he had contracted Her father stared at her for the moment chilled by a sense of unfamiliarity in her sudden assumption of an attitude of challenge and authority He had often heard her inveigh against the divorces so lightly obtained in the world about them He had thought it one of those pretty ornamental prejudices of hers that so gracefully adorned her youth and that he liked her to have when they did not interfere with anything of importance Now set up like a barrier in the path he stopped before this one particular prejudice perplexed at its sudden intrusion unwilling to believe that it was not a frail temporary obstruction to be put gently aside Now listen honey said he persuasively that s all very well I ve got no right to interfere and neither we ll admit has anybody But sometimes you have to push away these little rights and polite customs They re very nice for every day use but they re not for big occasions [ ] I suppose the Good Samaritan didn t really have any right to stop and bind up the wounds of the man he found by the wayside But I guess the feller he bound up was almighty glad that the Samaritan didn t have such a respect for etiquette and wait till he d found somebody to introduce them Oh papa that was different Don t confuse me and make me seem a fool I can t talk like you I can t express it all clearly and shortly I only know it s wrong it s a sin I wouldn t marry Dominick Ryan if he was divorced that way if it killed me to give him up So if the woman voluntarily took the money and went away and got Dominick to grant her the divorce Dominick being as we know a man of good record and spotless honor you d refuse to marry him I would certainly I would It would be perfectly impossible for me to marry him under those circumstances I should consider I was committing a sin a particularly horrible and unforgivable sin See here now Rosey just listen to me for a minute Do you know what Dominick Ryan s marriage is I don t suppose you do But you do know that he married his mistress a woman who lived with him eight months before he made her his wife She wasn t an innocent young girl by any means She knew all right where she was going [ ] She established that relation with him with the intention of marrying him She s a darned smart woman and a darned unscrupulous one That s not the kind of woman a man feels any particular respect for or that a girl like you d give a lot of sympathy to is it I don t see that that would make any difference she said I m not thinking of her character I m thinking of her rights And don t her character and her rights sort of dovetail into each other No I don t see that they do The law s above the character or the person It s the law without any question of the man or the woman Oh Rosey dear you re talking like a book not like a girl who s got to live in a world with ordinary people in modern times This woman that you re arguing about as if she was the mother of the Gracchi hasn t got any more morality or principle than you could put on the point of a pin She s been quite good and proper since her marriage Well now let s leave her and look at Dominick s side He marries her honorably and lives with her for nearly three years Every semblance of affection that he had for her gets rubbed off in those three years every illusion goes He s tied to a woman that he can t stand He went up to Antelope that time because they d had some sort of a scrap and he felt he couldn t breathe[ ] in the same house with her He told me himself that they d not lived as man and wife for nearly a year Now I don t know what you re going to say but I think to keep on living in that state is all wrong I ll borrow your expression I think it s a sin She answered doggedly It s awful but she s his wife Oh if you d seen her face when she talked to me her thin mean common face all painted and powdered and so miserable He thought she was wavering that he saw in this unreasonable illogical dodging of the point at issue a sign of defeat and he pushed his advantage And you a girl of heart and feeling like you would condemn that man and woman to go on living that lie that useless purposeless lie I can t understand it What good comes of it What s the necessity for it Do you realize what a man Dominick might be if he was married to the right woman and had a decent home where he could live like a Christian Why he d be a different creature He d have a future He d make his place in the community All the world would be before him and he d mount up to where he belongs And what is he now Nothing All the best in him s paralyzed by this hell of a box he s got himself into The man s just withering up with despair [ ]It was almost too much For a moment she did not answer then said in a small voice like a child s You re making this very hard for me papa My God Rosey he cried exasperated you re making it hard for yourself It s you with your cast iron prejudices and your obstinacy who are making it hard Well I ve got them she said rising to her feet I ve got them and they ll stay with me till I die Nothing s going to change me in this I can t argue and reason about them They re part of me She approached the mantelpiece and leaning a hand on it looked down at the fire The light gilded the front of her dress and played on her face down drooped and full of stern decision It s quite true she said slowly that I love Dominick I love him with the best I ve got It s true that I would like to be his wife It would be a wonderful happiness But I can t have it and so there s no good thinking about it or trying to bring it about It can t be and we you too papa must give it up He pressed himself back in his chair looking at her with lowering somber disapprobation a look he had seldom had cause to level at his daughter So you re going to condemn this poor devil who loves you and whom you say you love to a[ ] future that s going to kill any hope in him You re going to say to him You can be free and make something of your life and have the woman you want for your wife but I forbid all that and I m going to send you back to prison I can t seem to believe that it s my Rosey who s saying that and who s so hard and inhuman Rose turned from the fire He noted an expression almost of austerity on her face that was as new to him as the revelation of obstinacy and indifference to his will she had shown to night Papa you don t understand what I feel It s not what you want or what I want or what Dominick wants It s not what s going to please us and make us comfortable and happy It s something that s much more important than that I can t make Dominick happy and let him make his life a success at the expense of that woman I can t take him out of prison as you call it because he s got a responsibility in the prison that he voluntarily took on himself and that he s got to stand by A man can t stay by his marriage only as long as it s pleasant He can t throw down the woman he s made his wife just because he finds he doesn t like her If she s been disagreeable that s a misfortune but it doesn t liberate him from the promises he s made Then you think when a man like Dominick Ryan hardly more than a boy makes a mistake that ruins his life he s got to stay by it [ ] Yes he must He s given a solemn promise He must keep it Mistake or sin doesn t matter The old man was silent He had presented his case as strongly and persuasively as he knew how and he had lost it There was no longer any use in arguing with that unshakable feminine obstinacy rooted not in reason but in something rock like off which the arguments of reason harmlessly glanced He had a dim realizing sense that at the bottom of the woman s illogical whim driven nature there was that indestructible foundation of blind governing instincts and that in them lay her power I guess that lets me out he said turning to knock off the long ash on his cigar I guess there s no use Rosey for you and me to try to come to an agreement on this matter No there isn t And don t let s talk about it any more She turned from the fire and came toward him But you must promise me one thing that that woman is to be let alone that no one you or any one you have any control over makes any more offers of money to her She came to a stand beside his chair He wanted to hold out his hand to her as was his custom when she stood near him but he was afraid that she might not take it Yes I can promise that he said I ll not offer her any more money I don t want to see her again God knows [ ]It was an easier promise to make than Rose guessed The old man under an air of mild concurrence in her demands experienced a sensation of cynical amusement at the thought that the first move for a reopening of negotiations must come from Berny Oh yes I ll promise that he said amicably You needn t be afraid that I m going to go on offering her a fortune The thing s been done the woman s refused it and there it stands I ve no desire to open it again She leaned down to take his hand He relinquished it to her with an immense lightening of his heart and peace fell on him as he felt her rub her cheek against his knuckles So you re not mad at the old man after all he said almost shyly No she murmured not at him I was angry at what he was doing It was a subtly feminine way of getting round the delicate points of the situation that inconsistently feminine way which separates judgment of the individual from judgment of his acts But it relieved the Bonanza King of the heaviest weight that had lain upon him for many years and for once he gave thanks for the irrationalness of women Well good night honey he said no matter what crazy notions you ve got you re the old man s girl all right She kissed him [ ] And you won t forget your promise she murmured Of course not he said stoutly not sure just what she was alluding to Any promise I make to you stands put till the Day of Judgment Good night When she left him he lit another cigar sank lower in his chair and stared at the fire It was a deadlock In his helplessness the enraged helplessness of the man who had ridden triumphantly over all obstacles that fate had set in his path his prevailing thought was how much he would like to kill Berny She had done all this This viper of a woman the kind to tread on if she raised her head had baffled and beaten them all He could not murder her but he thought with grim lips of how he could crush and grind her down and let her feel how heavy Bill Cannon s hand could be It seemed for the moment as if everything were over They had reached a place where a blank wall stretched across the road Berny s refusing the money had been a serious obstacle but not an unconquerable one Rose to night had given the whole plot its death blow With lowering brows he puffed at his cigar groping in his mind for some way that might yet be tried He could not brook the thought of defeat And yet the
