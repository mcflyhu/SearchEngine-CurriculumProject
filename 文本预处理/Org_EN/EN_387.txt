Denis and Lucy were married at the end of September They went motoring in Italy for a month and by the beginning of November were settled at Astleys Astleys was in Berkshire and was Urquhart s home It was rather beautiful as homes go with a careless prosperous grace about it at which Lucy laughed because it was so Urquhartesque Almost at once they asked some people to stay there to help with the elections and the pheasant shooting The elections were hoped for in December Urquhart did not propose to bother much about them he was a good deal more interested in the pheasants but he had of course every intention of doing the usual and suitable things and carrying the business through well Lucy only laughed to want to get into Parliament was so funny looked at from the point of view she had always been used to Denis being used by inheritance and upbringing to another point of view did not see that it was so funny to him it was a very natural profession for a man to go into his family had always provided a supply of members for both houses Lucy and Peter socially more obscure laughed childishly together over it Fancy being a Liberal or a Conservative out of all the things there are in the world to be as Peter had once commented But it was delightfully Urquhart like this lordly assumption of a share in the government of a country No doubt it was worth having because all the things Urquhart wanted and obtained were that he had an eye for good things like Peter only he gained possession of them and Peter could only admire from afar They were talking about the election prospects at dinner on the evening of the fifteenth of November They were a young and merry party At one end of the table was Denis looking rather pale after a hard day s hunting and very much amused with life at the other Lucy in a white frock small and open eyed like a flower and very much amused too and between them were the people young mostly and gay who were staying with them Lucy who had been brought up in a secluded Bohemianism found it very funny and nice having a house party and so many servants to see after them all that one needn t bother to run round and make sure everyone had soap and so on One person not young who was staying there was Lord Evelyn Urquhart Lucy loved him He loved her and told funny stories Sometimes between the stories she would catch his near sighted screwed up eyes scanning her face with a queer expression that might have been wistfulness he seemed at times to be looking for something in her face and finding it Particularly when she laughed in her chuckling gurgling way he looked like this and would grow grave suddenly They had talked together about all manner of things being excellent friends but only once so far about Lucy s cousin Peter Once had been too much Lucy had found The Margerisons were a tabooed subject with Lord Evelyn Urquhart Denis shrugged his shoulders over it They did him brown you see he explained in his light casual way Uncle Evelyn can t forgive that And it s because he was so awfully fond of Peter that he s so bitter against him now I never mention him it s best not You know you keep giving the poor dear shocks by looking like Peter and laughing like him and using his words You are rather like you know I know said Lucy It s not only looking and laughing and words we think alike too So perhaps if he gets fond of me he ll forgive Peter sometime He s an implacable old beggar Denis said It s stupid of him It never seems to me worth while to get huffy it s so uncomfortable He expects too much of people and when they disappoint him he Takes umbradge Lucy filled in for him That was another of Peter s expressions they shared together a number of such stilted high sounding phrases mostly culled either out of Adelphi melodrama or the fiction of a by gone age To night when the cloth had been removed that they might eat fruit Denis was informed that there was a gentleman waiting to see him The gentleman had not vouchsafed either his name or business so he could obviously wait a little longer till Denis had finished his own business In twenty minutes Denis went to the library and there found Hilary Margerison sitting by the fire in a great coat and muffler and looking cold When he rose and faced him Denis saw that he also looked paler than of old and thinner and less perfectly shaved and his hair was longer He might have been called seedy looking he might have been Sidney Carton in The Only Way he had always that touch of the dramatic about him that suggested a stage character He had a bad cough Oh said Urquhart polite and feeling embarrassed how do you do I m sorry to have kept you waiting they didn t tell me who it was Sit down won t you Hilary said thanks he thought not He had a keen sense of the fit So he refused the cigarette Urquhart offered him and stood by the fire looking at the floor Urquhart stood opposite him and thought how ill and how little reputable he looked Hilary said in his high sweet husky voice It is no use beating about the bush I want help We are in need we are horribly hard up to put it baldly That has passed between your family and mine which makes you the last person I should wish to appeal to as a beggar I propose a business transaction He paused to cough Urquhart feeling impatient at the prospect of a provoking interview when he wanted to be playing bridge said Yes politely You said Hilary are intending to stand as a candidate for this constituency You require for that I fancy a reputation wholly untarnished the least breath dimming it would be for you a disastrous calamity I have some information which if sent to the local Liberal paper would seriously tell against you in the public mind It is here He took it out of his breast pocket and handed it to Urquhart a type written sheet of paper He must certainly have been to a provincial theatre lately he had hit its manners and methods to a nicety the silly ass Urquhart took the paper gingerly and did not look at it Thanks but I don t know that I am interested do you know Isn t this all rather silly Mr Margerison If you will oblige me by reading it said Mr Margerison So Urquhart obliged him It was all about him as was to be expected enough to make a column of the Berkshire Press Well said Hilary when he had done Well said Urquhart folding up the paper and returning it thank you for showing it me But again I must say that I am not particularly interested Of course you will send anything you like to any paper you like it is no business of mine There s the libel law as of course you know newspapers are as a rule rather careful about that No respectable paper I needn t say would care to use such copy as this of yours Well good night Oh by the way I suppose your brother told you all that Hilary said I had it from various reliable sources He stood uncertain with wavering eyes despair killing hope You will do nothing at all to save your reputation then Urquhart laughed unamused with hard eyes He was intensely irritated Do you think it likely I don t care what you get printed in any dirty rag about me man Why on earth should I The gulf between them yawned it was unbridgeable From Hilary s world insults might be shrieked and howled dirt thrown with all the strength of hate and neither shrieks nor dirt would reach across the gulf to Urquhart s They simply didn t matter Hilary realising this grew slowly dully red with the bitterness of mortified expectation Urquhart s look at him supercilious contemptuous aloof slightly disgusted hurt his vanity He caught at the only weapon he had which could hurt back I must go and tell Peter then that his information has been of no use Urquhart said merely Peter won t be surprised It s no good your trying to make me think that Peter is joining in this absurdity He has too much sense of the ridiculous He seems to have talked to you pretty freely of my concerns which I certainly fancied he would keep to himself I suppose he did that by way of providing entertaining conversation Peter was always a chatterbox it was as well that Peter was not there to hear the edge in the soft indifferent voice but he isn t quite such a fool as to have countenanced this rather stagey proceeding of yours He knows me used to know me pretty well you see Good night You have plenty of time to catch your train I think Hilary stopped to say Is that all you have to say You won t let your connexion with our family with Peter induce you to help us in our need I ve done an unpleasant thing to night you know I ve put my pride in my pocket and stooped to the methods of the cad for the sake of my wife and little children I admit I have made a mistake both of taste and judgment I have behaved unworthily you may say like a fool But are you prepared to see us go under to drive by and leave us lying in the road as you did to that old Tuscan peasant Does it in no way affect your feelings towards us that you are now Peter s cousin by marriage besides being practically his half brother I am not practically or in any other way Peter s half brother said Urquhart casually But that is neither here nor there Peter and I are have been friends as you know I should naturally give him help if he asked me for it He has not done so all that has happened is that you have tried to blackmail me I really see no use in prolonging this interview Mr Margerison Good night Urquhart was bored and impatient with the absurd scene Into the middle of it walked Peter pale and breathless He stood by the door and looked at them dazed and blinking at the light looked at Urquhart who stood leaning his shoulder against the chimney piece his hands in his pockets the light full on his fair tranquil bored face and at Hilary pale and tragic with wavering unhappy eyes So they stood for a type and a symbol and a sign that never as long as the world endures shall Margerisons get the better of Urquharts They both looked at Peter and Urquhart s brows rose a little as if to say More Margerisons yet Hilary said What s the matter Peter Why have you come Peter said rather faintly I meant to stop you before you saw Denis I suppose I m too late I made Peggy tell me I found a paper you see and I asked Peggy and she said you d come down here to use it Have you He has already done his worst Denis s ironic voice answered for him Sprung the awful threat upon me Peter leant back against the door feeling rather sick He had run all the way from the station and as always he was too late Then he laughed a little The contrast of Hilary s tragedian air and Urquhart s tranquil boredom was upsetting to him Urquhart didn t laugh but looked at him enquiringly It s certainly funny rather he said quietly You must have got a good deal of quiet fun out of compiling that column Oh said Peter But I didn t you know I gather you helped supplied much of the information That story of the old man I brutally slew and then callously left uncared for on the road you seem to have coloured that rather highly in passing it on I suppose it was stupid of me to fancy that you weren t intending to make that public property Not that I particularly mind there was nothing to be ashamed of in that business but it somehow never happened to occur to me that you were relating it I didn t said Peter I have never told anyone Urquhart said nothing his silence was expressive Peter stammered into speech incoherently At least at least yes I believe I did tell Peggy the story months ago in Venice but I didn t say it was you I merely said if someone had done that what would she think I wanted to know if she thought we ought to have found the old man s people and told them I see said Urquhart And did she No She thought it was all right Peter had known beforehand that Peggy would think it was all right that was why he had asked her to be reassured to have the vague trouble in his mind quieted And she apparently had seen through his futile pretence had known it was Urquhart he spoke of needed reassuring about Peter didn t realise that even less shrewd observers than Peggy might easily know when it was Urquhart he spoke of and had gone and told Hilary And Hilary in his need had twisted it into this disgusting story and had typed it and brought it down to Astleys to night with other twisted stories I suppose the rest too said Urquhart you related to your sister in law to see what she would think Peter stammered I don t think so No I don t believe anything else came from me Did it Hilary Hilary shrugged his shoulders and made no other answer It really doesn t particularly matter said Urquhart whether the informant was you or some other of my acquaintances I daresay my gyp is responsible for the story of the actresses I brought down to the St Gabriel s dance he knew about it at the time I believe I am not in the least ashamed of that either the Berkshire Press is extremely welcome to it if it can find space for it Well now will you both stay the night with me or must you get back The last good train goes at I think Peter said Come along Hilary Urquhart stood and watched them go As they turned away he said in his gentle inexpressive voice that hadn t been raised in anger once Can I lend you any money Peter Peter shook his head though he felt Hilary start No thank you It is very good of you Good night Good night Going out of the room they came face to face with Lord Evelyn Urquhart coming in He saw them he stiffened a little repressing a start he stood elaborately aside to let them pass bowing slightly Neither Margerison said anything Hilary s bow was the stage copy of his own Peter didn t look at him at all but hurried by The servant let them out and shut the hall door behind them Lord Evelyn said to his nephew in the library swinging his eye glass restlessly to and fro Why do you let those people into your house Denis I thought we had done with them They came to call said Denis who did not seem disposed to be communicative I can t say why they chose this particular hour Lord Evelyn paced up the room restless nervous petulant It s monstrous he said querulously Perfectly monstrous Shameless How dare they show their faces in this house I suppose they wanted something out of you did they Denis merely said After all Peter is my cousin by marriage you must remember And I have never broken with him Lord Evelyn returned The more shame to you He s as great a swindler as his precious brother they re a pair you can t deny that Denis didn t attempt to deny it probably he was feeling a little tired of the Margerisons to night I m not defending Peter or his brother either I only said that he s Lucy s cousin and she s very fond of him and I m not keen on actually breaking with him As to the brother he s so much more of an ass than anything else that to call him a swindler is more than he deserves He simply came here to night to play the fool he s no more sense than a silly ass out of a play That was what Peter was telling Hilary on the way to the station Hilary defended himself rather feebly My good Peter we must have money We are in positive want Of course I never meant to proceed to extremities I thought the mere mention of such a threat would be enough to make him see that we really were desperately hard up and that he might as well help us But he doesn t care Like all rich people he is utterly callous and selfish Do you think Lucy would possibly give us any help if you asked her I shan t ask her said Peter Don t please Hilary he added miserably Can t you see See what I see that we get a little more destitute every day that the boarders are melting away that I am reduced to unthinkably sordid hackwork and you to the grind of uncongenial toil that Peggy can t afford to keep a cook who can boil a potato respectably they were like walnuts to day that she and the children go about with their clothes dropping off them I see that and I see these Urquharts closely connected with our family rolling in unearned riches spending and squandering and wasting and never giving away I see the Robinsons our own relations fattening on the money that ought to have come to us and now and then throwing us a loan as you throw a dog a bone I see your friend Leslie taking himself off to the antipodes to spend his millions that he may be out of the reach of disturbing appeals I see a world constituted so that you would think the devils in hell must cry shame on it His cough made worse by the fog choked his relation of his vision Peter had nothing to say to it he could only sigh over it The Haves and the Have Nots there they are and there is no getting round the ugly fact Denis said Peter would lend me money if I asked him You heard him offer But I am not going to ask him We are none of us going to ask him If I find that you have and that he has given it you I shall pay it straight back You know Hilary we re really not so badly off as all that we get along pretty well I think better than most other people The other Have Nots they made no difference in Hilary s eyes to the fact that of course the Margerisons should have been among the Haves Hilary said You are absolutely impervious Peter to other people s troubles and turned up his coat collar and sank down on a seat in the waiting room Of course they had missed the the last good train and were now waiting for the the slow one Peter walked up and down the platform feeling very cold He had come away in his excitement without his overcoat The chill of the foggy night seemed to sink deep into his innermost being Hilary s words rang in his ears I see that we get a little more destitute every day It was true Every day the Margerisons seemed to lose something more To night Peter had lost something he could ill afford to part with another degree of Denis Urquhart s regard That seemed to be falling from him bit by bit perhaps that was why he felt so cold However desperately he clung to the remnants as he had clung since that last interview in Venice he could not think to keep them much longer at this rate As he walked up and down the platform his cold hands thrust deep into his pockets he was contemplating another loss one that would hurt absurdly much If Hilary felt that he needed more money so badly he must have it There were certain things Peter declined to do He wouldn t borrow from the Urquharts but he would sell his last treasured possession to soothe Hilary for a little while The Berovieri goblet had been bought for a lot of money and could at any moment be sold for a lot of money The Berovieri goblet must go That evening in the tiny attic room Peter took the adorable thing out of the box where it lay hid and set it on the chest of drawers in front of the candle so that the flame shone through the blue transparency like the setting sun through a stained glass window It was very very beautiful Peter sat on the bed and looked at it as a devotee before a shrine In itself it was very beautiful a magic thing of blue colour and deep light and pure shadow and clear lovely form Peter loved it for itself and for its symbolic character For it was a symbol of the world of great loveliness that did he knew exist When he had been turned out of that world into a grey and dusty place he had kept that one thing to link him with loveliness and light Peter was a materialist he loved things their shapes and colours with a passion that blinded him to the beauty of the colourless the formless the super sensuous He slipped his fingers up the chalice s slim stem and round its cool bowl and smiled for pleasure that such a thing existed had existed for four hundred years to gladden the world Well anyone would have thought I should have smashed you before now he remarked apostrophising it proudly But I haven t I shall take you to Christie s myself to morrow as whole as you were the day Leslie gave you me It was fortunate that Leslie was out of reach and would not hear of the transaction If he had been in England Peter would have felt bound to offer him the goblet and he would have paid for it too enormous a price to be endured Leslie s generosity was sometimes rather overwhelming When Peter took Hilary and Peggy the cheque he had received and told them what he had received it for Hilary said I suppose these things must be It was fortunate you did not ask my advice Peter I should have hesitated what to say It is uncommonly like bartering one s soul for guineas To what we are reduced He was an artist and cared for beautiful goblets He would much rather have borrowed the money or had it given him Peggy who was not an artist said Oh Peter darling how sweet of you Now I really can pay the butcher I ve had to hide from him the last few mornings in the coal hole You dear child I hope you won t miss that nice cup too much When our ship comes in you shall have another When sighed Hilary who was feeling over worked that evening He did advertisement pictures for a weekly paper a sordid and degrading pursuit Well said Peggy hopefully the boarders we have now really do pay their rent the way they never did in Venice That s such a comfort If only Larry s cough gets off his chest without turning to bronchitis I will be quite happy But these loathsome fogs And that odious man coming round wanting to know why aren t the children attending school I m sure I said to him I wish they were the house would be the quieter missing them but their father insists on educating them himself because he won t let them mix up with the common children in the school they re by way of being little gentry do you see I said though indeed you mightn t think it to look at them Oh dear me he was so impolite he wouldn t believe that Hilary was doing his duty by them though I assured him that he read them all the Ancient Mariner yesterday morning while they watched him dress and that I was teaching them the alphabet whenever I had a spare minute But nothing would satisfy him and off the two eldest must go to the Catholic school next week to be destroyed by the fog and to pick up with all the ragamuffins in the district An abominable cast iron system Hilary murmured mechanically Of a piece with all the other institutions of an iniquitous state And what do you think added Peggy who was busy putting a patch in Silvio s knickerbockers Guy Vyvian turned up out of nowhere and called this afternoon bad manners to him for a waster When he found you were out Hilary he asked where was Rhoda he d no notion of sitting down to listen to me talking Rhoda was out at work too of course I told him it wasn t most of us could afford to play round in the afternoons the way he did I suppose he ll come again bothering and upsetting the child just when she s settling down a bit I ve thought her seeming brighter lately she likes going about with you Peter But there ll be pretty doings again when that man comes exciting her Vyvian is a cad and a low fellow Hilary said and I always regretted being forced into partnership with him but I suppose one can t kick one s past acquaintances from the door I at least cannot Some people can and do they may reconcile it with their standards of decency if they choose but I cannot Vyvian must come if he likes and we must be hospitable to him We must ask him to dinner if he comes again Yes sniffed Peggy I can see him Sticking his fork into the potatoes and pretending he can t get it through Oh have him to dinner if you like he must just make the best of what he gets if he comes He ll be awfully rude to the rest too but I ll apologise for him beforehand Though a cad Hilary observed Vyvian is less of a vacuous fool than most of the members of our present delightful house party He at least knows something of art and literature and can converse without jarring one s taste violently by his every word He is not after all a Miss Matthews or a Mr Bridger Apologies therefore are scarcely called for perhaps Peggy said What a solemn face Peter Is it the Vyvian man or the beautiful cup that we ve never half thanked you for getting rid of yet Peter said It s the Vyvian man He makes me feel solemn You see I promised Mrs Johnson faithfully to keep Rhoda out of his clutches if I could Darling what a silly promise Oh of course we ll all do our best but if he wants to clutch her the silly little bird he ll surely do it Not that I m saying he does want to I daresay he only wants to upset her and make her his slave and then run away again to his own place the Judas But I don t want him to do that Rhoda will be unhappier than ever again Oh well I wouldn t wonder if when Rhoda sees him again now she sees what a poor creature it is after all It may be a turning point with her and who knows will she perhaps settle down afterwards and be a reasonable girl and darn her stockings and wear a collar If one is to talk of stockings began Hilary I noticed
