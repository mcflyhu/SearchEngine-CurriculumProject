It was the comb honey in the one pound sections on which they were depending for an early sale at a fancy price and naturally they wished to take this off first The only place to pile and sort it was in the cabin and they proceeded to turn the boys bedroom into a storehouse There was no furniture to take out they merely removed the bedding and laid boards over the bunk to make a platform Carl nailed wire gauze over the window and Bob constructed a rough screen for the outer door With the bees in that fierce robbing humor the place must above all things be kept bee tight It was a ticklish task to take off the supers for the bees were intensely irritable and a hive was no more than opened when a host of robbers collected eager to pilfer a mouthful The boys had to be quick in their movements Bob opened the hive and the moment the lid was up Carl drove great blasts of smoke into the super at the same time keeping enough smoke in the surrounding air to repel the thieves Bob then seized the super knocked it on the ground to jar out the few bees left in it and hurried with it to the cabin In the storeroom Alice was waiting to sort and grade the honey The delicate sections were glued fast in the frames that held them and had to be pried carefully out The very finest sections sealed white and smooth all over were classed as Fancy those of slightly rougher appearance ranked as No A certain number of the rest might be saleable at a low price the honey was just as good as the Fancy but their appearance was against them But the larger part was worth nothing except for the honey that could be obtained by the extractor From the first it became apparent that there was going to be more honey than they had expected and their hopes began to go nervously upward When the opening of a hive showed a good super with all its combs smooth and white the boys chuckled and Bob exulted in its weight as he lugged it into the house Some colonies had as many as three supers like this but many had only one or two and some where the colony had swarmed only a worthless and unfinished set of combs Beside these there were the extracting supers containing a good deal of honey but they did not intend to extract at once The comb honey came first The piles of supers accumulated in the little room faster than Alice could remove the sections With rising hope the boys worked feverishly and shortly after noon they carried in the last super Then they set to work to assist Alice at the sorting and grading Every section had to be looked at and estimated the propolis and wax scraped from the wood and then placed carefully in the shipping cases The emptied supers were put outdoors the supers with unfinished sections were set by themselves All three worked hard that afternoon and much of the next day but it was not till nearly supper time that they emptied the last super and filled the last shipping case There were sections Of these ranked as Fancy and about as No Nearly sections were unsaleable These we can eat ourselves remarked Alice We ought to get a dozen for the best and for the No Bob estimated That comes to said Carl who was a lightning calculator Why that s not so bad Then all those unsaleable sections must have at least a thousand pounds of honey in them that we can extract Besides there must be three or four hundred dollars worth of extracted honey on the hives which we ll be able to sell later Hurrah shouted Bob We ll pull through after all Yes and with something to the good cried Alice In their relief and joy they joined hands and performed a wild dance around the shipping cases It did not last long though for they were tired and stiff with bending over the supers they were gummy with propolis and wax and sticky with honey and on the window was a cluster of bees the size of a small swarm which had been carried in with the honey After dark Carl brushed them off into a bucket carried them out and poured them down in front of a weak hive They crawled gladly in and as they all had their sacs full of honey they were admitted A honey laden bee is always welcome to any hive The comb honey had to be sold at once for the time was growing short Bob proposed that he should go over to Morton and make the sale in Toronto by telegraph or by long distance telephone if he could get connections It was a good plan but Carl was anxious to be on hand to hear how the negotiations went Alice was no less eager and was moreover unwilling to be left alone at the cabin so it ended in preparations for all of them to go to Morton and make the deal together Above all things we must be careful to leave the cabin bee tight Alice warned them Just fancy the bees finding a way in They d carry all that honey back to the hives before we got home So they plugged every chink in the logs most carefully with wet clay and moss looked to the wire screens and even blocked up the chimney The cabin door they fastened with a big padlock and chain and Alice packed up half a dozen of the best sections for a gift to Mr Farr No use trying to sweeten him Bob warned her He ll take it but he ll be as hard as nails with us all the same He keeps business and friendship separate you know Anyway I m going to take him the honey I rather like him you know Alice persisted They went down in the boat a slow and rather lazy drift with the current in the warm morning sunshine About noon they reached Morton and found that they could get telegraph connections at the railway station and long distance telephone at the hotel As a first step Bob telegraphed to the headquarters of the Provincial Bee keepers Association to learn what the season had been throughout the country and how prices were ranging It was two o clock in the afternoon before the reply came the waiting had been something of a strain and Bob looked nervous when he ripped open the yellow envelope but then his face brightened Splendid Listen to this he cried Honey crop reported about one third normal throughout Ontario Severe drought Members advised to hold for good prices Market firm The drought must have been worse with them than it was with us said Carl Well prices are likely to go way up and we ought to have a chance to make some money It looks so replied Bob and now I want you to let me do the negotiating I m an ignoramus at handling bees but I think I can sell honey better than either of you Who ll you sell it to asked Alice I m going to try Mr Brown of Brown Son you know the wholesale grocery people We used to buy a lot of stock from him for the store I ve often bought from him by long distance and I ll see if I can t sell to him the same way Anyhow I think he ll give us a square deal The telephone was not in a booth but merely attached to the wall of the hotel office However there was no one in sight or hearing at the time and they might as well have been in a private room Bob called the long distance connection and after about fifteen minutes waiting got a reply from the Toronto grocery dealers Alice and Carl stood beside him and listened breathlessly to the conversation Is that Mr Brown cried Bob This is Bob Harman of Harman s Corners you know No I m not there just now I m running a bee ranch up north A bee ranch Honey bees you know Yes Yes we have a lot of splendid comb honey Are you in the market For a moment he listened attentively We have about a hundred dozen Fancy and about fifty dozen No he continued We ask and a dozen for the two grades freight paid to Toronto What an awful price We ll never get it whispered Alice startled Don t speak You ll shake his nerve Carl muttered No Bob was saying into the transmitter We wouldn t care to take much less There s been a bad crop everywhere and honey is scarce this year Oh we couldn t think of taking that What s that All right In an hour then Good by He turned away from the telephone They actually had the nerve to offer for the Fancy and for the other he said They said they had bought a lot of Fancy at but I think that was pure bluff And I thought they were sure to give us a square deal Well I m to ring them up again in an hour and if they won t come up to a decent figure there are other dealers in Toronto It seemed a long time to wait Alice carried her gift of honey to Mr Farr and came back reporting that he had seemed much pleased But he had shaken his head grimly at her account of the poor season The old skinflint needn t worry said Carl angrily He ll get his money all right Yes but I m not going to sacrifice that honey said Bob with decision It s cost us too much with cats and moose and stings and bears and wendigos It ought to be worth a dollar a pound If we can t do well in Toronto we ll ring up Montreal Honey prices are often better there They did not wait much beyond the hour in calling Mr Brown again and this time Bob got him with very little delay Yes he said in reply to some question I ve thought it over and we can t possibly accept what you offer We ll shade the price to for the best grade but we think we should have at least for the other It s really beautiful honey He listened a moment and frowned Hold the line a moment he said at last I must consult my brother He turned to Carl and Alice holding his hand over the transmitter so that their conversation should not leak through to Toronto He says his best figure is and cash down he said in a low tone What shall we do Take it by all means That isn t so bad said Carl anxiously Yes take it take it Alice begged We mustn t lose the sale Bob looked at them thoughtfully for a moment and then an expression of determination crossed his face He turned back to the telephone Sorry can t do it he said firmly We will take and but that s positively our last word We re thinking of shipping to Montreal Alice turned pale and clutched Bob s arm in remonstrance but he paid no attention to her No he said into the telephone I m not trying to drive any hard bargain Mr Brown But there s scarcely any comb honey this year and prices are going up Shall we ship All right That will be satisfactory We can ship to morrow or the day after Good by He hung up the telephone and made a wild leap into the air Victory he exclaimed We get and cash on delivery About twenty cents a dozen more than we d counted on It was the mention of Montreal that fetched them for they were keen to get the honey We re saved Frenzied finance said Carl who had been jotting down some figures on a scrap of paper But it comes to and with the we ve got we ll be able to make our payment all right Let s get that honey shipped at once First however they had to arrange for a teamster to go out to the apiary for the honey then they had to make some purchases in the village and when they had finished their errands it was too late for the long pull up the river that afternoon So they all stayed at the hotel and started up stream at eight o clock the next morning It was nearly noon when they arrived at the apiary landing and they were tired but light hearted with success They went up toward the cabin with their arms full of packages and suddenly Alice who was in front uttered a sharp cry A cloud of robber bees hung roaring about the cabin The door which they had left locked stood half open They dropped their parcels and rushed up The main room was swarming with bees but fortunately the screen door into the honey room was shut and they had not been able to get in though they were trying hard But a glance through the wire showed that the honey had been pillaged The piles of supers were overturned so were the stacks of full shipping cases and half of them seemed to be gone Alice gave one glance through the door at the wreck and then dropped on a bench and hid her face in her hands Bob rushed into the store room with Carl at his heels A great part of the best honey was gone nearly all the No grade and some of the Fancy They could not tell accurately at the moment how much More than a thousand pounds seemed to be missing but the thief had abstained from taking any of the unsaleable sections It can t have been gone long said Carl excitedly Let s see if there are any tracks As they hastened out they noticed that the heavy staple that held the padlock had been pried off The ground near the door was too hard to show tracks but a little way from the river they found footprints heading toward the cabin and in the gravel along the shore they found the mark where a boat had been drawn up Gone by water said Bob grimly Do you suppose it was that half breed squatter There s no one else living along the river within ten miles He must have seen us all going down the river yesterday and knew that he had a clear field What fools we were to leave all that honey We re done for now Not much returned Bob If that fellow has the honey we ll get it back Here come along He led the way rapidly back to the cabin took down his rifle and began to fill the magazine with cartridges Carl picked up his shotgun Bob What are you going to do exclaimed Alice Get that honey back replied her brother shortly Going down the river Well if you re going I ll go too and paddle the boat No you stay here Allie There won t be any shooting but this is no girl s business Stay here and get the bees out of here and things straightened up We won t be long I hope Alice looked entreating and frightened but Bob was immovable Carrying their guns the two boys went back to the boat and in another minute were shooting down the stream as fast as the oars and current could take them As they went they decided upon a plan of action They did not want any collision with the half breed If it came to weapons it would mean somebody killed or wounded and that would be worse than losing the whole crop of honey They only wanted to make sure that he had really stolen the honey and where he had hidden it Afterwards they would see about recovering it They landed near the great slough left the boat and went cautiously through the woods to the edge of the clearing No one was in sight No dog barked this time and the cabin door was shut Perhaps they ve gone away with the haul muttered Bob The only way is to go up and find out So they marched boldly across the stumpy field to the cabin and knocked Entrez cried a voice from within and Bob pushed open the door There was a startled exclamation from within Larue rose from a seat where he was doing something with a large piece of buckskin and he looked black as he saw the two boys standing armed in the doorway His wife a tall rather handsome and shabbily dressed woman stopped short in the middle of the floor looking frightened Two pretty gipsy like children slunk into the background Bon jour bon jour said both Bob and Carl politely Bon jour responded the squatter and his face softened a little What do you want You speak French Only a little not enough to talk replied Bob Mr Larue our house was broken into while we were away and about a thousand pounds of honey stolen over worth We came to see if you knew anything about it Me How should I know anyt ing about zat returned Larue It was hard to put the accusation direct and Bob hesitated a little The honey was taken away by boat You have a boat and you re the only person that lives down this way so You say I steal your honey cried the squatter angrily I tell you I know nottings about it Look Is the honey here Carl and Bob both looked and Bob sniffed as well and sniffed again with suspicion The cabin was all one large room and a thousand pounds of honey certainly could not have been concealed in it It contained only the simplest furniture a dirty cooking stove a table two rough beds on which were spread the two fine bearskins that Alice had seen and a small cupboard But Bob suddenly darted forward and picked up a small fragment of honeycomb from the floor under the table Where did this come from he cried Bee tree returned the half breed cunningly I don t believe it exclaimed Carl examining the bit of wax This comb was built on foundation It came from our bee yard Give us back our honey and we ll say nothing more about it urged Bob You don t need to steal honey We ll give you all you can eat Voila cried Larue I know nottings about your honey It is that you want to make trouble You come here to see me bien you are welcome You come here to insult me you go outside quick When we come back we ll bring a constable cried Carl The woman said a sentence to her husband in rapid French which the boys failed to catch Let your constable come continued the squatter He find nottings But as for you you git out and stay out I know nottings about your honey Va t en Git Come along No use talking any more muttered Bob and the boys departed feeling rather beaten and angry They crossed the clearing and paused to look back from the cover of the woods Larue was standing in his doorway gazing after them All the same I know the honey is somewhere about this place Bob broke out Why I could smell it I couldn t be mistaken And that piece of comb It was certainly a piece of a section Carl agreed I m afraid though that I made a bad break in threatening him with a constable He ll be sure to move the plunder right away to some place where nobody could ever find it He certainly hasn t got it in his cabin Maybe it s stored in the barn Likely enough Or somewhere near here in the woods How we ll ever locate it is more than I can imagine If it s in any exposed place some bees will be likely to find it and rob it out for him Wish they would said Bob Carl looked quickly at his brother and meditated in silence for a moment Look here he exclaimed at last Why can t we send bees to scout for that honey They might even carry it back and no power on earth could stop them if they got going Of course they couldn t lug the sections home but they d lick out all the honey and put it in their hives again and we could extract it That would be better than losing it all Bob looked dubious at first and then he began to laugh Robbing the robber he exclaimed I don t know but what it might work Anyway it s a brilliant idea and ought to be tried None of those shipping cases had their tops closed and the bees could get into them without any trouble But how ll we work it It s three miles from here to the bee yard Yes we d have to bring some hives down here within range replied Carl We could float them down in the boat Four or five would do to see if they found the honey and then we could bring more They got into their boat and pulled up stream again From a distance they saw Alice waiting at the landing peering eagerly down the river Thank goodness you re back she exclaimed fervently I ve been so worried Did you have a fight Did you find the honey Neither honey nor fight returned Bob as they went ashore But we think we know where the honey is and we re going to send some messengers after it to morrow Messengers What do you mean cried Alice mystified Carl chuckled and outlined the plan to her much to her amusement though she was doubtful of its success Why there s a thousand pounds of honey missing she said A colony can t carry more than ten pounds of honey a day What a lot of colonies it would take or what a long time to have them bring all that back even if they find it However the boys were determined to give the plan a trial and as soon as it was dark they loaded half a dozen of their strongest colonies into the boat Along with them they took supers of empty combs It crowded the boat considerably and made an awkward cargo but they got it safely down the river Landing near Larue s clearing they put the hives ashore and then carried them one by one with much labor and stumbling through the woods Within two hundred yards of Larue s barn but well back among the trees they set the hives down behind a cedar thicket Bob then laid a trail of honey from the hives almost to the barn sprinkling a little on the ground and leaves every few feet Before he had quite reached the barn the hound began to bay noisily and the boys scuttled off to the river and paddled homeward About nine o clock the next morning they made their way cautiously down to their ambushed messengers to see what was going on They found things active Bees were coming and going rapidly dropping heavily laden in front of the hives Every colony was alert excited and bad tempered The intelligent insects knew well that honey was coming from some unnatural source Robbing was in the air they felt it and every entrance was massed with guards in readiness for a possible attack They ve found it exclaimed Carl gleefully The boys sat down and watched All the bees were certainly going straight toward Larue s clearing and they came heavily back dropping by scores at the hives almost too heavy to fly In the course of an hour the activity had greatly increased Yes they ve located it all right said Bob They re heading toward his barn it seems to me I wish I dared go and look but we d better be careful not to show our noses Larue is probably on the watch They put on the supers of empty combs to give storage room for the honey and went back to the cabin for dinner laughing But they were too much excited to stay long away from the ambushed hives and they returned to them toward the middle of the afternoon Alice was intensely anxious to be allowed to go with them but the situation was highly delicate and they decided that it was hardly safe When they came within a hundred yards of the hidden hives they heard the roar of the bees Never before had they seen such a fury of work A black belt a river of bees seemed to be flowing over the trees toward the clearing The entrances were almost choked as the insects poured out and in and the ground in front was covered with crawling bees that had dropped exhausted They were savagely cross too as bees always are when robbing is going on There was fighting at the entrance of every hive probably due to bees mistaking their doors in the new location The whole front of the hive was brown with guards and it was dangerous to go nearer than twenty feet Bob had brought a veil with him though and he opened one of the supers He received several stings on the hands but reported that the combs were nearly half full already and not with nectar but with thick ripened honey No doubt at all that it s our honey coming back he said I wonder what Mr Larue thinks of all this If we re careful he ll never suspect that we had any hand in it He ll just take it as a kind of judgment for his thieving But what oceans of bees seem to be going over You wouldn t think that half a dozen hives could send out so many I ve a notion that the bees from the home yard are coming here too said Carl Just look in the air In fact a long air line of bees could be discerned going straight up the river above the trees It was a long flight of course but bees have been known to go four or five miles when honey is scarce Perhaps the home apiary might have found the stolen honey even if they had not moved any bees During that afternoon the excitement rose to a perfect frenzy A torrent of bees swept overhead from the ambushed hives to the clearing and up the river toward home The boys began to grow uneasy as Carl had said no power on earth could stop things now and it looked rather as if they had unlocked forces that were too much for them Carl hastened home to look at conditions there and came back breathless reporting the apiary in a turmoil Bees were flying robbing fighting and bringing in honey Many of the colonies had not yet learned where the honey was coming from and were flying around the cabin in clouds or trying to pounce on some weaker colony But there must be over a million bees going to the Frenchman s place he said I think we ought to try to find out what s going on there The whole family may be stung to death It did look dangerous but they were greatly afraid to be seen Larue s indignation must be well up to shooting point before this But they crept cautiously toward the clearing Before they reached the edge of the woods they could hear a roar like a distant cataract and when they came into the open they were appalled at what they saw bunk n He left his bunk and went up on deck again Most economists think his theories are sheer bunk
