IV After their dinner at the hotel Roddy and Peter strolled down the quay and over the tiny drawbridge that binds Otrabanda to Willemstad There for some time half way between the two towns they loitered against the railing of the bridge smoking and enjoying the cool night breeze from the sea After his long nap Roddy was wakeful He had been told that Willemstad boasted of a caf chantant and he was for finding it But Peter who had been awake since the ship s steward had aroused him before sunrise doubted that there was a caf chantant and that if it did exist it could keep him from sleep and announced his determination to seek his bed Left to himself Roddy strolled slowly around the narrow limits of the town A few of the shops and two of the caf s were still open throwing bright spaces of light across the narrow sidewalks but the greater number of houses were tightly barred the streets slumbered in darkness For a quarter of an hour Roddy sauntered idly and then awoke to the fact that he was not alone Behind him in the shadow a man with his face hidden in a shawl the sound of his footsteps muffled by his rope sandals was following his wanderings Under the circumstances after the developments of the day Roddy was not surprised nor was he greatly interested Even in Porto Cabello at one time or another every one was beset by spies And that here in the central office of the revolutionists Alvarez should be well represented was but natural Twice softly and quickly the man who followed had approached him from the rear and each time lest he should have some more serious purpose than to simply spy upon him Roddy had stepped into the street But when for the third time the man drew near his approach was so swift that Roddy had no time to move away The man brushed against him and when he had passed Roddy found a letter had been pressed into his hand The hour was late Roddy looked like a tourist the note had been delivered covertly Roddy concluded it contained an invitation to some disreputable adventure and after calling the man the name associated with what Roddy believed to be his ancient and dishonorable profession he tossed the note into the street With a cry of dismay the man ran toward it but Roddy was before him As the note had left his hand his fingers had touched upon heavy waxen seals In an instant he had retrieved the note and followed eagerly by the man carried it to the light of a gas lamp The envelope was not illuminating the sealing wax was stamped with no crest or initials the handwriting was obviously disguised After observing that from the shadow the man still watched him while at the same time he kept an anxious lookout up and down the street Roddy opened the note It read You have come to Cura ao for a purpose One who has the success of that purpose most at heart desires to help you To morrow just before sunrise walk out the same road over which you drove to day Beyond the Caf Ducrot the bearer of this letter will wait for you with a led horse Follow him If you think he is leading you into danger order him to ride in advance and cover him with your revolver If you will come say to the bearer Vengo if not No Vengo He has orders not to reply to any question of yours If you speak of this to others or if the bearer of this suspects you have arranged for others to follow you he will only lead you back to your hotel and your chance to right a great wrong will have passed There was no signature But as though it were an afterthought at the bottom of the page was written Adventures are for the adventurous Standing well in the light of the street lamp with his back to the houses with his face toward the waiting messenger Roddy read the letter three times But after the first reading his eyes neglected the body of the note and raced to the postscript That was the line that beckoned and appealed to him it seemed that whoever wrote the letter doubted he would come to the rendezvous and was by that line enticing him mocking him daring him to refuse It held forth both a promise and a challenge As to who the writer of the note might be there were in Roddy s mind three explanations He considered them hastily Peter was the author of the note and it was a poor joke intended to test him It was a genuine offer from some one who had guessed the object of his visit to Cura ao and honestly wished to be of service It came from the man in the mask and his associates who resenting his interference of the morning had pleasant thoughts of luring him down a lonely road and leaving him lying there Which of the three suppositions might be correct it was impossible to know but the postscript decided him He beckoned[Pg ] to the messenger and the man ran eagerly forward I will come said Roddy The man smiled with pleasure bowed to him and dived into the darkness As he ran down the street Roddy stood listening until the soft patter of the sandals had ceased and then slowly returned to the hotel For an hour still speculating as to who his anonymous friend might be he stood smoking upon the balcony On the quay below him a negro policeman dozed against a hawser post A group of cargadores stretched at length upon stacks of hides chattered in drowsy undertones In the moonlight the lamps on the fishing boats and on the bridge now locked against the outside world burned mistily and the deck of the steamer moored directly below him was as deserted and bare as uncanny and ghostlike as the deck of the ship of the Ancient Mariner Except for the chiming of ships bells the whisper of the running tide and the sleepy murmur of the longshoremen the town of Willemstad was steeped in sleep and silence Roddy finding he could arrive at no satisfactory explanation of the note woke the night porter and telling that official he was off before daybreak to shoot wild pigeons and wanted his coffee at that hour betook himself to his cot It seemed as though he had not twice tossed on the pillow before the night watchman stood yawning at his side Roddy and Peter occupied adjoining rooms and the door between the two was unlocked When Roddy had bathed dressed and with a feeling of some importance stuck his revolver into his pocket he opened the door and still suspicious that his faithful friend was sending him on a wild goose chase for a few moments stood beside his bed But Peter deep in the sleep of innocence was breathing evenly stentoriously Not without envying him the hours of rest still before him Roddy helped himself to Peter s revolver left him a line saying it was he who had borrowed it and went out into the dark and empty streets Half awake and with his hunger only partially satisfied Roddy now regarded his expedition with little favor He reverted strongly to the theory that some one was making a fool of him He reminded himself that if in New York he had received such a note he either would have at once dismissed it as a hoax or turned it over to the precinct station house But as the darkness changed to gray and the black bulk of the Caf Ducrot came into view his interest quickened He encouraged himself with the thought that while in New York the wording of the note would be improbable hysterical melodramatic in hot turbulent Venezuela it was in keeping with the country and with the people Since setting forth from the hotel a half hour had passed and as he left the Caf Ducrot behind him the night faded into the gray blue mist of dawn Out of the mist riding slowly toward him mounted on one pony and leading another Roddy saw the man who on the night before had brought him the letter He was leaning forward peering through the uncertain light When he recognized Roddy he galloped to him and with evident pleasure but without speaking handed him the reins of the led pony Then motioning to Roddy to wait he rode rapidly down the road over which the American had just come Roddy settled himself in the saddle and with a smile of satisfaction beamed upon the ghostlike world around him So far at least the adventure promised to be genuine Certainly he argued Peter could not have prepared a joke so elaborate Apparently satisfied that Roddy had brought no one with him the messenger now rejoined him and with a gesture of apology took the lead and at a smart trot started in the same direction in which Roddy had been walking Roddy gave his guide a start of fifty feet and followed With the idea of a possible ambush still in his mind he held the pony well in hand and in front of him in his belt stuck one of the revolvers He now was fully awake No longer in the darkness was he stumbling on foot over the stones and ruts of the road Instead the day was breaking and he had under him a good horse on which if necessary he could run away The thought was comforting and the sense of possible danger excited him delightfully When he remembered Peter sleeping stolidly and missing what was to come he felt a touch of remorse But he had been warned to bring no one with him and of the letter to speak to no one He would tell Peter later But he considered what if there should be nothing to tell or if there were what if he should not be alive to tell it If the men who had planned to assassinate Colonel Vega intended to punish him for his interference they could not have selected a place or hour better suited to their purpose In all the world apparently he was the only soul awake On either side of him were high hedges of the Spanish bayonet and back of them acres of orange groves The homes of the planters lay far from the highway and along the sides of the road there were no houses no lodge gates not even a peon s thatched hut Roddy was approaching a sharp turn in the road a turn to the left at almost right angles It was marked by an impenetrable hedge Up to now although the hedges would have concealed a regiment the white road itself had stretched before him straight and open But now the turn shut it from his sight The guide had reached the corner Instead of taking it he turned in his saddle and pulled his pony to a walk To Roddy the act seemed significant It was apparent that they had arrived at their rendezvous Sharply Roddy also brought his pony to a walk and with a heavy pull on the reins moved slowly forward The guide drew to the right and halted To Roddy s excited imagination this man uvre could have but one explanation The man was withdrawing himself from a possible line of fire Shifting the reins to his left hand Roddy let the other fall upon his revolver Holding in the pony and bending forward Roddy peered cautiously around the corner What he saw was so astonishing so unlike what he expected so utterly out of place that still leaning forward still with his hand on his revolver he stared stupidly For half a mile the road lay empty but directly in front of him blocking the way was a restless pirouetting pony and seated upon the pony unmoved either by his gyrations or by the appearance of a stranger in her path was a young girl As Roddy had cautiously made his approach he had in his mind a picture of skulking Venezuelans with pointed carbines his ears were prepared for a command to throw up his hands for the slap of a bullet He had convinced himself that around the angle of the impenetrable hedge this was the welcome that awaited him And when he was confronted by a girl who apparently was no more a daughter of Venezuela than she was a masked highwayman his first thought was that this must be some innocent foreigner stumbling in upon the ambush In alarm for her safety his eyes searched the road beyond her the hedges on either side If she remained for an instant longer he feared she might be the witness to a shocking tragedy that she herself might even become a victim But the road lay empty in the hedges of spiked cactus not a frond stirred and the aged man who had led him to the rendezvous sat motionless watchful but undisturbed Roddy again turned to the girl and found her closely observing him He sank back in his saddle and took off his hat Still scanning the hedges he pushed his pony beside hers and spoke quickly Pardon me he said but I think you had better ride on Some men are coming here They they may be here now That his anxiety was entirely on her account was obvious The girl colored slightly and smiled As she smiled Roddy for the first time was looking directly at her and as he looked his interest in assassins and his anxiety as to what they might do passed entirely from him For months he had not seen a girl of his own people and that this girl was one of his own people he did not question Had he first seen her on her way to mass with a lace shawl across her shoulders with a high comb and mantilla he would have declared her to be Spanish and of the highest type of Spanish beauty Now in her linen riding skirt and mannish coat and stock with her hair drawn back under a broad brimmed hat of black straw she reminded him only of certain girls with whom he had cantered along the Ocean Drive at Newport or under the pines of Aiken How a young woman so habited had come to lose herself in a lonely road in Cura ao was incomprehensible Still it was not for him to object That the gods had found fit to send her [Pg ]there was to Roddy sufficient in itself and he was extremely grateful But that fact was too apparent Though he was unconscious of it the pleasure in his eyes was evident He still was too startled to conceal his admiration The girl frowned her slight boyish figure grew more erect My name is Rojas she said My father is General Rojas I was told you wished to help him and last night I sent you a note asking you to meet me here She spoke in even matter of fact tones As she spoke she regarded Roddy steadily When the night before Inez had sent the note she had been able only to guess as to what manner of man it might be with whom she was making a rendezvous at daybreak in a lonely road And she had been more than anxious Now that she saw him she recognized the type and was reassured But that he was worthy of the secret she wished to confide in him she had yet to determine As she waited for him to disclose himself she was to all outward appearances tranquilly studying him But inwardly her heart was trembling and it was with real relief that when she told him her name she saw his look of admiration disappear and in his eyes come pity and genuine feeling Oh gasped Roddy unhappily his voice filled with concern Oh I am sorry The girl slightly inclined her head I came to ask you she began speaking with abrupt directness what you propose to do It was a most disconcerting question Not knowing what he proposed to do Roddy to gain time slipped to the ground and hat in hand moved close to the pommel of her saddle As he did not answer the girl spoke again this time in a tone more kindly And to ask why you wish to help us As though carefully considering his reply Roddy scowled but made no answer In a flash it had at last come to him that what to Peter and to himself had seemed a most fascinating game was to others a struggle grim and momentous He recognized that until now General Rojas had never been to him a flesh and blood person that he had not appreciated that his rescue meant actual life and happiness He had considered him rather as one of the pieces in a game of chess which Peter and himself were secretly playing against the Commandant of the San Carlos prison And now here confronting him was a human being living breathing suffering the daughter of this chessman bone of his bone flesh of his flesh demanding of the stranger by what right he made himself her father s champion by what right he pushed himself into the tragedy of the Rojas family In his embarrassment Roddy decided desperately to begin at the very beginning to tell the exact truth to omit nothing and then to throw himself upon the mercy of the court The gray mist of the morning had lifted Under the first warm rays of the sun like objects developing on a photographer s plate the cactus points stood out sharp and clear the branches of the orange trees separated assuming form and outline the clusters of fruit took on a faint touch of yellow From the palace yard in distant Willemstad there drifted toward them the boom of the morning gun With his reins over his arm his sombrero crumpled in his hands his face lifted to the face of the girl Roddy stood in the road at attention like a trooper reporting to his superior officer We were in the tea house of the Hundred and One Steps said Roddy We called ourselves the White Mice Speaking quickly he brought his story down to the present moment When he had finished Inez who had been bending toward him straightened herself in the saddle and sat rigidly erect Her lips and brows were drawn into two level lines her voice came to him from an immeasurable distance Then it was a joke she said A joke cried Roddy hotly That s most unfair If you will only give us permission we ll prove to you that it is no joke Perhaps as I told it it sounded heartless I told it badly What could I say that I am sorry Could I a stranger offer sympathy to you But we are sorry Ever since Peter proposed it ever since I saw your father The girl threw herself forward trembling Her eyes opened wide You saw my father she exclaimed Tell me she begged did he look well Did he speak to you When did you she stopped suddenly and turning her face from him held her arm across her eyes It was four months ago said Roddy I was not allowed to speak to him We bowed to each other That was all I must tell them cried the girl they must know that I have seen some one who has seen him But if they know I have seen you She paused as though asking advice she looked questioningly at Roddy He shook his head I don t understand he said My mother and sister don t know that I am here Inez told him If they did they would be very angry No one she added warningly must know They are afraid of you They cannot understand why you offer to help us And they mistrust you That is why I had to see you here in this way With a shrug of distaste the girl glanced about her Fortunately she added you understand Why yes Roddy assented doubtfully I understand your doing what you did but I don t understand the others Who is it he asked who mistrusts me Who he added smiling besides yourself My mother answered Inez directly your consul Captain Codman Colonel Vega and In surprise Roddy laughed and raised his eyebrows Vega he exclaimed Why should Vega mistrust me Knowing what was in his mind the girl made him a formal little bow It is not she answered because you saved his life In obvious embarrassment she added It is because you are not in the confidence of your father You can see that that must make it difficult for Colonel Vega Bewildered Roddy stared at her and again laughed And what possible interest he demanded can my father have in Colonel Vega For a moment with distrust written clearly in her eyes the girl regarded him reproachfully Then she asked coldly Do you seriously wish me to think that you do not know that While they had been speaking even when Inez had made it most evident to Roddy that to herself and to her friends he was a discredited person he had smiled patiently His good humor had appeared unassailable But now his eyes snapped indignantly He pressed his lips together and made Inez an abrupt bow I assure you I know nothing he said quickly He threw the reins over the neck of the pony and with a slap on its flank drove it across the road within reach of the waiting Pedro Then lifting his hat and with another bow he started in the direction of Willemstad Inez too surprised to speak sat staring after him But before he had taken a dozen steps as though she had called him back and asked him to explain he halted and returned He had entirely recovered his good humor but his manner when he spoke was not conciliatory The trouble is this he said your friends are so deep in plots that they have lost sight of the thing that counts While they are mistrusting and suspecting and spying on each other a man is dying I know that much anyway That is all I care to know As though it were an extenuating fact he added It is a question of character It is a Venezuelan way of doing things But it is not our way It was very kind of you to give me this chance to explain our interfering But I see now everybody he added dryly has taken pains to make it very plain that we are a nuisance He paused and to assure her it was not she he was upbraiding smiled cheerfully In his most confidential manner he continued lightly For myself I have always thought there was something to say for the fools who rush in where angels fear to tread I remember once seeing a fool rush into a burning building and rescue a child while I and some other angels shouted for ladders He nodded and again lifted his hat Good by he said and thank you Leaving her seated silent in the saddle he walked away This time he had turned the bend in the road and had proceeded along it some hundred yards when from behind him he heard approaching at a reckless pace the hoof beats of a pony Looking back he saw a whirlwind of fluttering skirts and scattered sparks and pebbles Inez followed by Pedro drew up even with him and as she dragged her pony to a halt threw herself free of the pommel and dropped at his feet to the road Had he not caught her by the shoulders she would have stumbled into his arms A strand of hair had fallen across her face her eyes were eager flashing She raised her gloved hands impulsively and clasped them before him Please she begged You must not go It is true what you say about us but you must help us I did not know I had forgotten It is three years since I talked to any one any one from your country I had forgotten It is true we are suspicious we are not straightforward like you like the people in the States But you must not punish us for that Not me At all times the face raised to his was beautiful Now the delicate lips like those of a child before it breaks into sobs were trembling the eyes lifted appealingly were eloquent with tears You must advise me said the girl You must help me She raised her clasped hands higher She regarded him wistfully Won t you she begged Her attack had been swift masterly every feminine weapon had been brought into effective action and the surrender of Roddy was sudden and complete In abject submission he proceeded incoherently My dear young lady he cried But my dear young lady He was rewarded with a brilliant blinding smile Then you will help me Inez asked Roddy recovered himself quickly My Spanish is very bad he answered but what it sounds like in English is I am at your feet The sun now was shining brightly and in the open road they were as conspicuous as though they had stood in a shop window on Broadway Across the road in the hedge opposite a gate barred a path that led into one of the plantations Roddy opened the gate and together followed by Pedro with the ponies they found a spot where they were hidden by the hedge from any one passing on the highway Inez halted in the shade of one of the orange trees Speaking rapidly she sketched for Roddy a brief history of the various efforts that had been made to rescue her father She explained why these efforts had failed She told him of the revolution led by Pino Vega and the good it was expected to accomplish [Pg ]At first the girl spoke in some embarrassment She knew that to be where she was at that hour alone with a stranger was in the eyes of her friends and family an unpardonable offense And though she resented their point of view the fact that it existed disquieted her But the man at her side did not seem to consider talking to a girl in the open sunshine either as a novel experience or one especially disgraceful Politely with lowered eyes he gave to what she said the closest attention The circumstance that they were alone even the fact that she was young and attractive did not once appear to occur to him Seeing this Inez with each succeeding moment gained confidence in Roddy and in herself and spoke freely That is what we have tried to do she said Now I am going to tell you why I asked you to meet me here this morning and how I believe you can help me Three days ago I received a message from my father Roddy exclaimed with interest but motioned eagerly for her to continue It is in cipher she continued but it is his handwriting It is unmistakable It was given to me when I was at church I was kneeling in the chapel of St Agnes which is in the darkest corner of the building At first I was alone and then a woman came and knelt close beside me She was a negress poorly dressed and her face was hidden by her shawl For a moment I thought she was murmuring her prayers and then I found she was repeating certain words and that she was talking at me I have a letter a letter from your father she whispered I crowded closer and she dropped a piece of paper in front of me and then got to her feet and hurried away I followed but there were many people at mass and when I had reached the street she had disappeared The message she brought me is this Page paragraph That is all It is the second message we have had from my father in two years The first one was by word of mouth and came a month ago The meaning of that was only too plain But what this one means I cannot imagine nor proceeded Inez with distress can I see why if he had the chance to write to us he did not write more openly She looked appealingly at Roddy and paused for him to speak He was afraid the message would be intercepted said Roddy What he probably means to do is to send it to you in two parts The second message will be the key that explains this one He knew if he wrote plainly and it fell into the wrong hands Roddy interrupted himself and for a moment remained silent Page paragraph he repeated Has he sent you a book he asked Has any book come to you anonymously The girl shook her head No I thought of that she said but no books have come to us that we haven t ordered ourselves What do the others think asked Roddy The girl colored slightly and shook her head I have not told them I knew my mother would ask Pino to help her and she explained though I like Pino for certain reasons I do not wish to be indebted to him for the life of my father Before appealing to him I have been trying for two days to find out the meaning of the cipher but I could not do it and I was just about to show it to my mother when Captain Codman told us of your offer That made me hesitate And then as between you and Pino I decided you were better able to help us You live in Porto Cabello within sight of the prison Pino will be in the field His revolution may last a month it may last for years During that time he would do nothing to help my father When you risked being shot yesterday it seemed to me you showed you had[Pg ] spirit and also you are from the States and Pino is a Venezuelan so You needn t take up the time of the court said Roddy in persuading me that I am the man to help you To save time I will concede that What was the other message you received from your father The eyes of the girl grew troubled and her voice lost its eagerness It was charged in a French paper she said that the prisoners in San Carlos were being killed by neglect The French minister is a friend of our family and he asked Alvarez to appoint a committee of doctors to make an investigation Alvarez was afraid to refuse and sent the doctors to examine my father and report on his health One of them told him that Alvarez would permit him to send a message to my mother and to tell her himself whether he was or was not ill This is the message that they gave us as coming from my father I don t know what you gentlemen may decide as to my health he said but I know that I am dying Tell my wife that I wish to be buried in my native country and to place upon my tombstone my name and this epitaph He wrote history and made history The voice of the girl had dropped to a whisper She recovered herself and continued sadly Until three days ago that is the only word we have received from my father in two years The expression on Roddy s face was one of polite incredulity Seeing this Inez as though answering his thought said proudly My father made history when he arranged the boundary line between British Guiana and Venezuela Roddy shook his head impatiently I wasn t thinking of that he said I was thinking of the message It doesn t sound a bit like your father he exclaimed Not like what I ve heard of him The eyes of the girl grew anxious with disappointment Do you mean she asked that you think he did not send that message It doesn t sound to me said Roddy like the sort of message he would send knowing the pain it would cause He isn t the sort of man to give up hope either Even if it were true why should he tell your mother he is dying And that epitaph cried Roddy excitedly That s not like him either It is not modest With sudden eagerness he leaned toward her Did your father write history he demanded Unable to see the purpose of his question the girl gazed at him in bewilderment Why of course she answered And does any part of it refer to Porto Cabello After a moment of consideration Inez nodded The third chapter she said tells of the invasion by Sir Francis Drake Chapter three page fifty four paragraph four shouted Roddy I ll bet my head on it Don t you see what he has done he cried He sent you the key before he sent you the cipher The verbal message is the key to the written one They gave him a chance to send word to your mother and he took it He told her he was dying only that he might give her a direction apparently about an epitaph a boastful epitaph He never boasted while he was alive why should he boast on his tombstone His real message is this Look in the history I wrote of Venezuela on page fifty four paragraph four and when we have found it cried Roddy we ll have found the way to get him out of prison Inez was not convinced but his enthusiasm was most inspiriting We have the history at the house she cried and I know you can find it in the Spanish bookstore in Willemstad I must go at once [Pg ]She moved forward greatly excited her eyes lit with the happiness of this new hope Roddy ran to bring her pony and making a bridge of his hands lifted her to the saddle If I am right about this he said I must see you again to day Where can I meet you In spite of her eagerness the girl hesitated One by one the traditions of a lifetime were smashing about her I must tell my mother she pleaded And I know she will not allow me And she ll tell Pino interrupted Roddy To detain her he laid his hand upon the reins and shook them sharply Are you helping Pino to win a revolution he demanded or are you helping me to get your father out of prison Inez gazed at him in dismay In her brief twenty two years no man had spoken to her in such a manner Among her friends she knew of no Venezuelan who no matter what the provocation would have addressed his wife his sister his daughter in a tone so discourteous And yet this stranger was treating her who as she had been frequently and reliably informed was the loveliest and most lovable of her sex as he might a mutinous younger brother In spite of the new and serious ]thought that now occupied her mind this one was also sufficiently novel to compel her attention It both amused and fascinated her Here was at last one man who was working to help her father and not only in order to find favor in her bright eyes He needed her wits and her courage he wanted her help but he wanted it as from a comrade as he would have asked it of another man Unconsciously he was paying her the compliment that best pleased her When she nodded in assent she laughed delightedly partly at him for bullying partly at herself that she should for a moment have resented it I am helping you she said Not understanding why she laughed Roddy regarded her doubtfully Imitating the directness of his manner Inez spoke quickly You can keep the pony It is new to our stable and not known to belong to us To morrow morning before sunrise ride out again but this time take the road to Otrabanda and along the cliff Be sure to pass our house before sunrise Ride about a mile and turn down a bridle path to your left That will bring you to the beach If I cannot go Pedro will meet you You will get the history my father wrote at Belancourts in Willemstad For a moment she regarded him with friendly eyes If you should be right she exclaimed how can I ever thank you Roddy smiled back at her and shook his head I don t know that we were exactly looking for gratitude he said Now go he ordered for I can t leave until you are well out of sight With another delightful laugh that to Roddy was again inexplicable the girl accepted her dismissal It was her first rendezvous but in spite of her inexperience she knew that had it been made with a Venezuelan the man would not have been the one first to bring it to an end Roddy impatiently waited until a quarter of an hour had passed then galloped to Willemstad On the way he put up the pony at a livery stable in the suburbs and on foot made his way as quickly as possible to the bookstore What he wanted he explained were guidebooks and histories of Venezuela Among those the man showed him was one in three volumes in Spanish by Se or Don Miguel Rojas Roddy s fingers itched to open it but he restrained himself and after buying half a dozen other books returned to his hotel Peter was still asleep and he could not wait to waken him Locking himself in he threw the books he did not want upon the floor and with fingers that were all thumbs fumbled at the first volume of the history until he had found page fifty four His eyes ran down it to the fourth paragraph His knowledge of Spanish was slight but it was sufficient Page fifty four was the description of an attack from the sea by Drake upon the Fortress of San Carlos Translated by Roddy paragraph four read as follows Seeing that it was no longer possible to hold the fortress the defenders were assembled in the guard room and from there conducted to the mainland through the tunnel that connects San Carlos with the Fortress of El Morro Like a man in a trance Roddy walked to the adjoining room and shook the sleeping Peter by the shoulder Peter opened his eyes and the look in Roddy s face startled him into instant wakefulness What s wrong he demanded Nothing said Roddy Forgetting that to Peter it was unintelligible he pointed with a triumphant finger at paragraph four I have found an underground passage into the cell of General Rojas he said We must go back and dig him out In order to avoid the heat those planters who lived some distance from Willemstad were in the habit of rising by candlelight and when the sun rose it found them well advanced upon their journey So when on the following morning Roddy [Pg ]again set forth to meet Inez Rojas the few servants who knew of his early departure accepted it and the excuse he gave of wild pigeon shooting as a matter of course Without difficulty Roddy found the bridle path leading down from the cliff road to the sea and after riding for a short distance along the beach came upon Inez guarded by the faithful Pedro The cliff hollowed at its base by the sea hung over them hiding them from any one on the cliff road and the waves breaking into spray on an outer barrier of rock shut them from the sight of those at sea As Inez rose from the rock on which she had been seated and came eagerly to meet him her face was radiant with happiness Over night she appeared to have gained in health and strength to have grown younger and were it possible more beautiful The satisfaction in the eyes of Roddy assured her that he also had solved the riddle You have seen the book she called you understand I think so replied Roddy Anyway I ve got a sort of blueprint idea of it Enough he added to work on I didn t tell my mother Inez announced Nor she continued as though defying her own misgivings do I mean to tell her Until you can get back word to me until you say that this time you believe we may hope it seems to me it would be kinder to keep her in ignorance But I told Pedro she added She flashed a grateful smile at the old man and he bowed and smiled eagerly in return And he has been able to help me greatly He tells me she went on that his father who was in the artillery was often stationed at Morro before it was abandoned That was fifty years ago The tunnel was then used daily and every one knew of it But when the troops were withdrawn from Morro the passage was walled up and each end blocked with stone In San Carlos it opened into the guard room El Morro was hardly a fortress It was more of a signal station Originally in the days of the pirates it was used as a lookout Only a few men were kept on guard there and only by day They slept and messed at San Carlos Each morning they were assembled in the guard room and from there marched through the tunnel to El Morro returning again at sunset I don t know El Morro said Roddy You have probably seen it Inez explained without knowing it was a fort It s in ruins now Have you noticed she asked to the right of the[Pg ] town a little hill that overlooks the harbor It is just above the plain where the cattle are corralled until they are shipped to Cuba Well the ruins of El Morro are on top of that hill It is about a quarter of a mile from San Carlos so we know that is the length of the tunnel Pedro tells me for a part of the way it runs under the water of the harbor It was cut through the solid rock by the prisoners at San Carlos There must be a lot of people objected Roddy who know of it Fifty years ago they knew of it returned Inez eagerly but remember for half a century it has virtually ceased to exist And besides to my people there is nothing unusual in such a tunnel You will find them connected with every fort the Spaniards built along this coast and in Cuba and on the Isthmus of Panama All along the Spanish Main wherever there is more than one fort you will find them linked together by tunnels They were intended to protect the soldiers from the fire of the enemy while they were passing from one position to another The young people had been standing ankle deep in the soft moist sand Now the girl moved toward her pony but Roddy still stood looking out to sea He appeared to have entirely forgotten that Inez was present and to be intently regarding the waves that surged against the rocks and burst into glittering walls of foam At last with a
