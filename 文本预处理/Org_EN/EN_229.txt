The next morning Babbitts and I started out for the offices of Whitney Whitney They re far downtown near Wall Street way up in the top of a skyscraper where the air is good even in summer I d been in them before and it was funny as we shot up in the elevator to think of those first visits when I was so scared of Mr Whitney the chief as Jack Reddy calls him and it s his name all right We were shown right into his office like we d come with a million dollar lawsuit and when he saw me he got up and held out his big white hand Well well Molly How s the smartest girl in New York Then he looked from me to Babbitts with a twinkle in his eye She s looking fine my boy You ve taken good care of her And then back to me Treats you well eh If he doesn t remember Whitney Whitney s services are yours to command That s the way he is always glad to see you always with his joke But there s another side to him a sort of terrible fierce quiet I ve seen it and Gee whiz If he ever got after me the way I once saw him get after a man he thought was guilty I d crawl under the table and die right there on the carpet He isn t a bit good looking a big clumsy sort of man stoop shouldered and with a head of rough gray hair and eyes set deep under bushy brows When he questions you those eyes look at you kind and pleasant but forget it There s not a thing they don t see You think your face is solid flesh and blood It is to most but to Mr Whitney it s no more than a pane of glass His son George he was there and Jack Reddy too doesn t favor his father He s an awful stylish chap with blond hair sleeked down on his skull and glasses set pert on the bridge of his nose They say he s smart but not as big as the old man and he hasn t got the same genial easy way But he s always very cordial to us and even if he wasn t his father s son and a close friend of Jack Reddy s I guess I d like him anyhow They were very interested in what I had to say but with Mr Whitney himself you never can guess what he thinks He sits listening slouched down in his armchair with his shirt bosom crumpled like an old bear ruminating or hibernating is it in a hollow tree When I was through he stretched out his hand took a cigar from a box on the table and said Just call up the Azalea Woods Estates George and find out how long Miss Whitehall expects to be there Then as Mr George left the room he turned to me and said Want to make some money I have a lot of money ten thousand dollars the reward they gave me after the Hesketh Mystery was solved so money doesn t cut much ice with me But doing something for Mr Whitney does and I guessed right off he had a little job for Molly Babbitts I want to do whatever Whitney Whitney asks I said That s a privilege and you don t get paid for privileges He burst out laughing and said It s easily seen half of you s Irish Molly There is something you can do for me and whether you want it or not you ll be paid for your services just as O Mally my own detective is Here it is That information you got from your little friend is valuable As you were sharp enough to see Barker may try to get in touch with Miss Whitehall To my mind he d be more inclined to try her office than her home where there s a mother and a servant to overhear and ask questions What would you think about going on the switchboard again My old work the one thing I could do Bully I cried out forgetting my language in my excitement Mr Whitney smiled Then we re agreed As soon as I can arrange matters I ll let you know probably this afternoon I don t now know just where we ll put you but I fancy in the Black Eagle s own central And I don t need to say to both of you that you re to keep as silent as you did in the Hesketh case I smiled to myself at that Mr Whitney knew no one better that when it comes to keeping mum a deaf mute hasn t anything over me Just then Mr George came back He had got Tony Ford on the wire and heard from him that Miss Whitehall might be in her offices some time yet as she was trying to sublet them Late that afternoon I had my instructions The next morning I was to go to the Black Eagle Building and begin work as a hello girl If questioned I was to answer that all I knew was Miss McCalmont the old girl had been transferred and I was temporarily installed in her place It was my business to listen to every phone message that went into or out from the Azalea Woods Estates I would be at liberty to give my full attention as almost every office had its own wire Miss Whitehall had had hers but it had been disconnected since her failure and she was only accessible through the building s central The work was so easy it seemed a shame to take the money The first two days there was nothing doing and it was desperate dull The telephone office was off the main hall to one side of the elevator a bright little place on the street level A good part of the time I sat at the desk looking out at the people passing like shadows across the ground glass of the windows There were some calls for Miss Whitehall all business These no matter what they were I listened to but got nothing Sometimes she answered sometimes Tony Ford My desk was set so I could see out through the doorway into the hall and the first morning I was there I saw her pass She looked better than she had that night in her own apartment but her face had a grave worried expression which you couldn t be surprised at seeing how things stood with her It was the second evening and I was thinking of getting ready to go the building s exchange closed at half past six when a tall fellow with a swagger in his walk and his shoulders held back like he thought a lot of his shape stopped in the doorway and called out Hello Miss McCalmont How goes the times I looked up surprised and when he saw it wasn t Miss McCalmont he looked surprised too raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes with an exaggerated expression like he did it to make you laugh He was a fine looking chap if size does it over six feet and wide across the chest but his face broad and flat with cheeks too large for his features wasn t the kind I admire Also I noticed that the good natured look it had was contradicted by the gray small eyes sharp as a gimlet and hard as a nail I supposed he was some clerk from one of the offices come to ask Miss McCalmont to dinner they re always doing that and answered careless fingering at the plugs Miss McCalmont s been transferred You don t say says he leaning easy against the doorpost Since when is that Since I came I answered He grinned showing teeth as white as split almonds and his eyes over the grin began to size me up shrewd and curious Taking him for some fresh guy that Miss McCalmont was jollying along they do that too I paid no attention to him humming a tune and looking languid at my finger nails He wasn t phazed a little bit but making himself comfortable against the doorpost said Going to stay on here The central ll give you all the information you want I answered and wheeling round in my chair looked at the clock Ten minutes past six How slow the time goes when you re dull He burst out laughing and he did have a jolly infectious kind of laugh Say he said you re a live one aren t you I wouldn t be long if I had to listen to all the guys that ain t got anything better to do than block up doorways and try to be fresh He laughed louder and lolled up against the woodwork I like you fine said he Are you a permanency or just a fleeting vision Talking of fleeting visions ain t it about your dinner hour You act to me as if this was your first job was his answer sort of thoughtful Wouldn t it make you smile It did me a small quiet smile all to myself He saw it dropped his head to one side and said as smooth and sweet as molasses What do they call you little one It was all I could do to keep from laughing but I crumpled up my forehead into a scowl and looked cross at him What my name is you ll never know and what yours is you needn t tell me for I ve guessed I ve met members of your tribe before it s large and prominent the ancient and honorable order of jackasses He made me a low bow So flattered at this speedy recognition he says airy and smiling You may know the tribe but not the individual Permit me to introduce myself Anthony Ford I gave a start and turned it into a stretch So this was the wonderful Tony Ford a slick customer all right That don t convey anything to my mind I answered A rose by any other name still has its thorns For more data I m the managing clerk of the Azalea Woods Estates see seventeenth floor first door to your left Ain t I heard you were closed up there We are This may be the last time you ll ever see me so look well at me Er what did you say your name was One of the unemployed I said falling back in my chair and rolling my eyes up at the ceiling Hangs round my switchboard and hasn t the price of a dinner in his jeans I was too hasty said he this isn t your first job If your place is shut what are you doing here not at this present moment the actions of fools are an old story to me but in the building Closing up the business Did you think I was nosing round for an unlocked door or an open safe Does this fresh innocent countenance look like the mug of a burglar He grinned and thrusting a hand into his pocket rattled the loose silver there Hear that Has a sound like a dinner hasn t it That made me mad the vain fool thinking he could flirt with me as he had with Iola I slanted a side look at him and his broad shining face with the eyes that didn t match it gave me a feeling like I longed to slap it good and hard Gee I d have loved to feel my hand come whang up against one of those fat cheeks But it s the curse of being a perfect lady that you can t hit when you feel like it except with your tongue I ain t known many burglars I answered but now that I look at you it does come over me that you ve a family resemblance to those few I ve met Seeing which I ll decline the honor of your invitation Safety first That riled him He flushed up and a surly look passed over his face making it ugly Then he shrugged up his shoulders and leaned off the doorpost giving a hitch to the front of his coat I generally like a dash of tabasco in mine says he but when it comes to the whole bottle spilled in the dish it s too hot Just make a note of that against our next meeting I don t like being disappointed twice Good evening And off he went swaggering down the hall On the way home I wondered what Soapy d say when I told him but when he came in Tony Ford went straight out of my head for at last there was exciting news Barker had been located in Philadelphia Two people had seen him there one a man who knew him well and saw him the night before in a taxi the other an Italian who kept a newsstand That same evening between eight and nine Barker had stopped at the stand and bought several New York papers The Italian who was quick witted recognized him from his pictures in the papers and reported to the police He s evidently only going out after dark said Babbitts But a man can t hide for long whose picture s spread broadcast over the country And who s got a face like the American Eagle after it s grown a white mustache I answered That was Thursday night Friday morning I toddled down to my job feeling there wasn t much in it and that when I came home I d hear Barker was landed and it would be domestic life again for little Molly The day went by quiet and uneventful as the others had been I read a novel and sewed at a tray cloth and now and then jacked in for a call It was getting on for evening and I was thinking about home and dinner when Bang came two calls one right after the other that made me feel I was earning my money The first was at a quarter to five Our central came sharp and clear Hello Gramercy Long Distance Philadelphia s calling you Philadelphia Can you see me stiffening up with my hand ready to raise the cam All right Gramercy I could hear the girls in our central the wait of hum and broken sounds how well I knew it and then a distant voice brisk and business like Hello Philadelphia Waiting Then a pause and presently the whispering jar of the wires Here s your party Gramercy all right for Philadelphia Running over those miles and miles the voice a man s came clear as a bell I want to speak to the Azalea Woods Estates I made the connection softly lifted the cam and listened in Is this the office of the Azalea Woods Estates A woman s voice answered as close as if she was in the next room Yes who is it Is Mr Anthony Ford there No Mr Ford has left my employment I am Miss Whitehall my business is closed There was a pause My heart which had hit up a lively gait began to ease down Only Tony Ford Pshaw Are you there said the woman Yes came the answer Could you give me his address Certainly Hold the wire for a moment After a wait of a minute or two she was back with the address which she gave him He repeated it carefully thanked her and hung up Talk of false alarms I was so disappointed thinking I d got something for Mr Whitney that I sat crumpled up in my chair sulking and right in the middle of my sulks came the second call It was Long Distance again Toronto I wonder what Toronto wants with her I thought as I jacked in and then leaning my elbow on the desk listened not much interested Three sentences hadn t passed before I was as still as a graven image all my life gone into my ears Is that you Carol I could just hear it a fine little thread of sound as if it came from a ghost in the other world Yes who s speaking It s I J W B Barker s initials My heart gave a leap and then began to fox trot If I had any doubts her answer put an end to them I could hear the gasp in her breath the fright in her voice You What are you doing this for There s no danger I m careful Did you get my letter Yes this morning Will you come Are you sure it s all right Have you seen the papers here All of them Don t be afraid I m taking no risks Are you coming Yes When I can leave tonight There s a train at eight Good I ll meet you and explain everything Do as I said in the letter I ll be there Very well understand Please ring off Good bye For a moment I sat thinking She was going to Toronto to meet Barker by a train that left at eight and it was now half past five There was no use trying to trace the call I knew enough for that so I got Mr Whitney s office and told him careful without names He was awful pleased and handed me out some compliments that gave me the courage to ask for something I was crazy to get the scoop for Babbitts It would be a big story Barker landed through the girl he was in love with I knew they d follow her and could Babbitts go along I don t have to tell you that he agreed making only one condition if they were unsuccessful silence O Mally who was up from Philadelphia would go Babbitts could join him at the Grand Central Station I took a call for the Dispatch found Babbitts and told him enough to send him home on the run but not much there s too many phones in those newspaper offices It was nearly seven when I got there myself dragged him into our room and while I packed his grip gave him the last bulletins He was up in the air It would be the biggest story that had ever come his way I had to go down to the station with him for neither he nor O Mally knew her I was desperate afraid she wouldn t come get cold feet the way women do when they re eloping But at a quarter of eight she showed up She didn t look a bit nervous or rattled and went about getting her ticket as quiet as if she was going for a week end to Long Island O Mally he was a fat red faced man looking more like a commercial traveler than a sleuth was right behind her as she bought it Then as she walked to the track entrance with her suitcase in her hand I saw them follow her lounging along sort of neighborly and casual till the three of them disappeared under the arch It was late before I went to sleep that night I kept imagining them tracking her through the Toronto Depot leaping into a taxi that followed close on hers and going somewhere but where I couldn t think to meet Barker For the first time I began to wonder if any harm could come to Babbitts In detective stories when they shadowed people there were generally revolvers at the finish But after all Johnston Barker wasn t flying for his life or flying from jail As far as I could get it he was just flying away with the Copper Pool s money Perhaps that wasn t desperate enough for revolvers When I finally did go to sleep I dreamed that all of us the fat man Babbitts Carol Whitehall and I and Mr Barker were packed together in one taxi which was rushing through the dark lurching from side to side As if we weren t enough it was piled high with suitcases on one of which I was sitting squeezed up against Mr Barker who had a face like an eagle and kept telling me to move so he could get his revolver I don t know what hour I awoke but the light was coming in between the curtains and the radiators were beginning to snap with the morning heat when I opened my eyes I came awake suddenly with that queer sensation you sometimes have that you re not alone And I wasn t There sitting on a chair by the bedside all hunched up in his overcoat with his suitcase at his feet was Himself looking as cross as a bear I sat up with a yelp as if he d been a burglar You here I cried He looked at me glum as an owl and nodded Yes It s all right Why why what s happened Nothing You haven t been to Toronto and back in this time I ve been to Rochester and back he snapped She got out there waited most of this infernal night and took the first return train Came back Isn t that what I m saying For Himself to speak that way to me showed he was riled something dreadful She got off at Rochester and stayed round in the depot didn t see anyone or speak to anyone or send a phone or a wire She got a train back at three we followed her and saw her go up the steps of her own apartment Why what do you make of it He shrugged Only one of two things She either changed her mind or saw she was being shadowed
