On the shores of the Lido three days later Peter and Leslie came upon Denis Urquhart He was lying on the sand in the sun on the Adriatic side and building St Mark s rather well Peter stood and looked at it critically Not bad But you d better let us help you We ve been studying the original exhaustively Leslie and I A very fine and remarkable building said Leslie ponderously and Peter laughed for the sheer pleasure of seeing Urquhart s lazy length stretched on the warm sand Cheriton s somewhere about said Urquhart But he wouldn t help me with St Mark s He was all for walking round the island at a great pace and seeing how long it took him So superfluously energetic isn t he Fancy being energetic in Venice Peter was thankful that he was The thought of Cheriton s eyes upon him made him shudder He has his good points Urquhart added but he excites himself too much Always taking up some violent crusade against something or other Can t live and let live Another dome here I think Peter wondered if Cheriton s latest crusade was against Hilary s taste in art and if so what Urquhart thought on that subject It was an uncomfortable thought He characteristically turned away from it The intense blue of the sea contrasted with the fainter blue of the Euganean Hills said Leslie suddenly is most remarkable and beautiful What He was proud of having noticed that He was always proud of noticing beauty unaided He made his remark with the simple pleasure of a child in his own appreciation His glance at Peter said I am getting on I think The others agreed that he was correct He then bent his great mind to the completion of St Mark s and Urquhart discovered what Peter had long known that he could really play in earnest The reverse art handling serious issues with a light touch he was less good at Grave subjects like the blue of the sea or the shape of a goblet he approached with the same solidity of earnestness which he brought to bear on sand cathedrals It was just this that made him a little tiring But the three together on the sands made a happy and congruous party of absorbed children till Cheriton the energetic came swinging back over the sand hills Peter saw him approaching watched the resolute lunge of his stride His mother was about to be married for the third time one could well believe it I hope he is going to be nicer to me to day Peter thought Even as he hoped it and before Cheriton saw the party on the sands Peter saw the determined face stiffen and into the vivid eyes came the blank look of one who is cutting somebody Peter turned and looked behind him to see who it was and saw Mr Guy Vyvian approaching It was obvious from his checked recognition that he thought he knew Cheriton and that Cheriton did not share the opinion Peter saw Vyvian s mortified colour rise he was a vain and sensitive person Cheriton came and sat down among them His words as he did so audibly muttered were The most unmitigated cad He looked angry Then he saw Peter and seemed a little surprised but did not cut him he hardly could Peter supposed that he owed this only to the accident of Urquhart s presence since this young man seemed to go about the world ignoring everyone who did not please his fastidious fancy and Peter could not hope that he had done that Peter looked after Vyvian s retreating figure He could detect injured pride in his back He got up and brushed the sand from him I must go and talk to that man he said He s lodging with my brother The situation for a moment was slightly difficult Leslie and Urquhart had both heard Cheriton s description of Peter s brother s lodger Besides they had seen him and that was enough It was unlike Peter to make awkward situations He ended this one abruptly by leaving it to itself and walking away after his brother s lodger Vyvian greeted him huffily It needed all Peter s feeling for a hurt man to make him anything but distantly aloof Cheriton s description was so manifestly correct The man was a cad an oily bounder with a poisonous mind Peter wondered how Hilary could bear to have his help on the Gem Vyvian broke out about Cheriton Did you see that grand fellow who was too proud to know me Driven you away too has he We don t know people in boarding houses we re in our private flat ourselves It makes me sick But his vulgarity when he was angry was a shade less revolting because more excusable than when he wasn t So Peter bore it and even tried to be comforting and to talk about pictures Vyvian really knew something about art Peter was a little surprised to find that he knew so much remembering certain curious blunders of his in the Gem He did not talk about the Gem to Vyvian instinctively he avoided it Peter had a rather useful power of barring his mind against thoughts that he did not desire to have there without reasoning about it he had placed the Gem in this category He was absently watching the dim blue of the Euganean Hills against the clearer blue of the sky when he discovered that Vyvian was talking about Rhoda Johnson A dear little gurl with real possibilities if one could develop them I do my best She s fond enough of me to let me mould her atrocious taste But what can one do to fight the lifelong influence of a home like that a mother like that Oh frightful But she is fond of me and there s her hope Good bye said Peter I must go He could not for the life of him have said any of the other things he was thinking He would have given a lot to have been Cheriton for the moment so that he wouldn t mind being rude and violent It was horribly feeble all he could say was Good bye Having said it he went abruptly He sighed as he went back to Urquhart and Leslie Things were so difficult to manage One left one s friends to comfort a hurt bounder that was all very well but what if the bounder comforted was much more offensive than the bounder hurt However it was no good reasoning about these things Peter knew that one had to try and cheer up the hurt in the face of all reason simply because one felt so uncomfortable oneself if one didn t But it was almost worth while to have a few rather revolting people about they threw the others into such glorious relief As long as there were the nice people who laughed at life and themselves playing about the world nothing else in particular mattered And it was really extraordinarily good luck that Urquhart should happen to be playing about Venice at the same time as Peter In spite of Cheriton they would have a good time together And Cheriton would perhaps become friendly in time dear Jim with his queer manners People mostly did become friendly in quite a short time according to Peter s experience That the time as far as Cheriton was concerned had not yet arrived was rather obvious however His manners to Peter on the sands were still quite queer so queer that Peter and Leslie only stayed a few minutes more Peter refused Urquhart s suggestion that they should have tea together on the island and they crossed over to the lagoon side and got into their waiting gondola The lagoon waters were smooth like glass and pale and unflushed as yet with the coming sunset Dark lines of stakes marked the blue ship ways that ran out to open sea and down them plied the ships spreading painted wings to the evening breeze Leslie said I see in the Gem that there is a good old well head to be had from a man on the Riva Ca di Dio I want well heads as you know We ll go and see shall we The crystal peace of the lagoon was shattered for Peter He had been getting into a curious mood of late he almost disliked well heads and other purchasable forms of beauty After all when one had this limpid loveliness of smooth water and men walking on its surface like St Peter why want anything more Because Leslie would say one wants to possess to call beauty one s own Bother said Peter the vice of the age which was certainly acquisitiveness He was coming to the conclusion that he hated buying things And it was so awkward to explain to Leslie about Hilary and the Gem He had spent the last few days in trying without too much giving Hilary away to restrain Leslie from following his advice He said now All right we ll go and see But to say the truth I m not sure that Hilary is a very good authority on well heads He blushed a little as he said it it seemed to him that he had been saying that sort of thing very often of late Leslie was so persistent so incorrigibly intent on his purpose Leslie looked at him now over his large cigar a little speculatively According to you he remarked placidly after a moment your brother is uncommonly little of an authority on anything he mentions Fraternal scepticism developed to its highest point Peter nodded Our family way he said and added Besides that Vyvian man does as much of the Gem as Hilary There s a young man Leslie My word what a dog Talks about gurls So I left him I turned upon him and said Sir this is no talk for a gentleman to listen to I said it because I knew it was what he would expect Then I turned on my heel and left him without a word He ground his teeth and hissed A time will come But Cheriton seems rather a rude man all the same He hurts my feelings too whenever I meet him I too hiss A time will come But I don t believe it ever will Do you suppose the water is shallow over there or that the men walking on it are doing miracles It must be fun either way Let s do it instead of buying well heads Leslie The fact is buying so many things is rather demoralising I think Let s decide to buy no more I m beginning to believe in the simple life like Rodney Rodney hates men like you and Urquhart rolling plutocrats He wanted me to leave you and the other plutocrats and be a travelling pedlar I m not sure that I shan t before long Can t spare you Leslie grunted Peter flattered himself that he had successfully turned the conversation from well heads When after having tea with Leslie at Florian s he returned to the Palazzo Amadeo Teresina told him that someone had called to see the Signore and the Signore being out was waiting in the saloon Peter went to the saloon to see if he would do instead of the Signore and found a stout gentleman with a black moustache and up brushed hair spitting on the saloon floor A revolting habit as Hilary was wont wearily to remark but Peter always accepted it with anyhow outward equanimity My brother is unfortunately away from the house he explained with his polite smile and atrocious Italian But perhaps I can give him a message The visitor gave him a sharp look bowed ceremoniously and said Ah The Signore is the brother of Signor Margerison Truly the brother Peter assured him not even halving the relationship and indeed he seldom did that even in his thoughts The visitor gave him a card bearing the name of Signor Giacomo Stefani sat down at Peter s request spat between his feet and said I have had various affairs with your Signor brother before I am come to solicit his patronage in the matter of a pair of vases If he would recommend them for me in his paper as before They are good they might easily be antiques You wish my brother to mention them in his paper Peter gathered He was correct Exactly so Signor Stefani told him Of course on the same terms as before if the Signor would be satisfied with them Terms Peter repeated after him Signor Stefani became more explicit He named the terms That was what I paid Signor Margerison before for an article on a pseudo Sienese chalice But the vases are better they are good they might deceive an expert Truly they might be antiques He continued to talk while Peter listened He was taking it in rather slowly But at last not being stupid he no longer thought Hilary so He understood He stood up presently looking a little dazed It appears he said slowly in his broken Italian to Signor Stefani that you are making a rather bad mistake which is a pity I think you had better go home Signor Stefani gave a startled upward twist to his moustache and stood up too Excuse me he said rather angrily there is no mistake Your brother and I have very frequently had affairs together Peter looked at him frowning doubtfully as he collected his words I am right I think he said slowly that you are offering my brother a bribe to publish a fraudulent article on fraudulent goods of yours That is so Then as I said you are making a very serious mistake and and you had better go home Will you come this way please Signor Stefani continued to talk but so rapidly and loudly now that Peter couldn t follow him He merely shook his head and opened the door saying This way please I can t understand you when you talk so fast Signor Stefani with a final angry shrug and expectoration permitted himself to be ushered out of the room On the stairs outside they met Vyvian coming up who nodded affably to both of them Signor Stefani as he passed shrugged his shoulders up to his ears and spread his two hands wide with a look of resigned despair over his shoulder at Peter and Vyvian s brows went up at the gesture Peter ushered his guest out at the street entrance Signor Stefani s last words were I shall return shortly and see your brother in person I have made a foolish mistake in thinking that you were in his confidence Good evening So they parted more in sorrow than in anger Peter met Vyvian again on the stairs He was passing on but Vyvian stopped and said What have you been doing to Stefani to put him out so Peter stopped and looked at him for a moment He felt rather dazed as if someone had hit him a blow on the head He had to remember what was this funny bounder s place in the newly revealed scheme of things Not merely a funny bounder after all it seemed but just what Cheriton had called him But one couldn t let him know that one thought so one was ostensibly on Hilary s side against honesty against decency against all the world So Peter having located Vyvian and himself in this matter said nothing at all but went on upstairs Vyvian staring after him in astonishment none of Hilary s boarders had seen Peter discourteous before raised his eyebrows again and whistled beneath his breath So we re too fine for our brother s dirty jobs I m dashed if I don t believe it s that Peter went upstairs rather too quickly for his heart He returned to the saloon and collapsed suddenly into a chair feeling giddy Mrs Johnson came in a moment later and found him leaning back with closed eyes She was disturbed about his complexion The colour of putty poor Mr Peter You ve bin excitin yourself tearin about sight seein I know Tell me now just how you feel I m blest if I don t believe you ve a bin in the Cathedral smellin at that there choky incense It takes me like that always and Miss Gould says she s just the same Funny feelin s within haven t you now Yes said Peter just exactly that and they so overcame him that he began to laugh helplessly I m sorry Mrs Johnson he said presently I m an ass But I m all right now I came upstairs in a hurry that s all And before that a man talked so loud and so fast that it took my breath away It may be silly but I am like that as Miss Barnett says My brother and sister in law are both out aren t they Mrs Johnson sitting down opposite him and studying the returning tints of his complexion nodded That s it she said more cheerfully You re gettin a wholesome white again now I didn t like that unhealthy greeny grey But you ve none of you any colour you gentlemen not you nor your brother nor that pasty Vyvian None of you but the little curate he had a nice little pink face I m sure I wish some gals cared more for looks and then they wouldn t go after some as are as well let alone This cryptic remark was illuminated by a sigh Mrs Johnson now that she saw Peter improving in complexion reverted to her own troubles Peter replied vaguely No I suppose they wouldn t People ought to care for looks of course They matter so much more than anything else really Without goin all that way with you Mr Peter said Mrs Johnson and with all due respect to Great Minds which I haven t got and never shall have and nor had my poor dear that s gone so I m sure I don t know where Rhoder got her leanin s from I will say I do like to see a young man smart and well kept It means a respect for himself not to mention for those he takes out that is a stand by at least for a mother And the young fellows affect the gals too Rhoder now she d take some pains with herself if she went out with a smart fellow that was nicely turned out himself and expected her to be the same But as it is hair dragged and parted like a queer picture and a string of green beads for a collar as if she was a Roman with prayers to say and her waist Mr Peter But there I oughtn t to talk like this to a gentleman as Miss Gould would say I do keep on shockin Miss Gould you know But I find it hard to rec lect that about you Mr Peter you re so sympathetic you might be a young lady An I feel it s all safe with you an I do believe you d help me if you could I should be glad to said Peter wondering whether it was for the improvement of Rhoda s hair waist or collar that his assistance might be acceptable Mrs Johnson was looking at him very earnestly it was obvious that something was seriously amiss and that she was wondering how much she could venture to say to this sympathetic young man who might be a young lady She made a sudden gesture with her stout hands as if flinging reticence to the winds and leant forward towards him Mr Peter I don t hardly like to say it but could you take my gal out sometimes It does sound a funny thing to ask but I can t abide it that she should be for ever with that there Vyvian I don t like him and there it is And Rhoder does And he s just amusin himself and I can t bear it for my little gal that s where it is Mr Peter I hate the fellow though you may say I m no Christian for it and of course one is bidden not to judge but to love all men But he fair gives me the creeps like a toad Do you know that feelin Oh yes said Peter readily And of course I should like immensely to go out with Miss Rhoda sometimes if she ll let me But do you think she will I m afraid she would be dreadfully bored with me I haven t a Great Mind you know Rhoder likes you said Mrs Johnson a smile of relief overspreading her jolly face She was sayin so only the other day She has a great respect for your knowledge of art too You wouldn t think it just to talk with him she said but he knows the most surprisin things Knows them for himself that was how she put it without needin to depend on any books or what anyone else says I wish I was like that mother she says and sighs And of course I knew why she wished that and I said to her Rhoder my dear never you mind about knowin things gals don t need to bother their heads about that You look after the outside of your head I said chaffing her about her hair you know and leave the inside to look after itself I made her cross of course I m for ever makin Rhoder cross without meanin it But that just shows what she feels towards you you see And you d talk healthy like to her which is more than some does if I know anythin One feels that of you Mr Peter if you ll excuse my sayin it that your talk is as innocent as a baby s prattle though it mayn t always mean much Thank you very much said Peter I will certainly prattle to Miss Rhoda whenever she will let me I should enjoy it of course Then that s settled Mrs Johnson rose and shook out her skirts with relief And a weight off my mind it will be You could make a third with Rhoder and that Vyvian to morrow afternoon if you were so good and not otherwise employed They re off together somewhere I know Making a third was a little beyond even Peter s readiness to be helpful and he looked dubious I wonder if Mr Vyvian would let me do that You see he doesn t much like me I expect I give him the creeps like a toad Then seeing Mrs Johnson s relieved face cloud he added Oh well I ll ask them to take me and she smiled at him as at a good child I knew you would Hilary didn t come in to dinner That was as well it gave Peter more time Perhaps it would be easier late at night to speak of the hopeless weary impossible things that had suddenly risen in the way easier to think of things to say about them that wouldn t too much hurt Hilary or himself At dinner Peter was very quiet and polite to everyone Vyvian s demeanour towards him was touched with irony his smile was a continual reference to the fellowship of secrecy that bound them Rhoda was very silent Peter supposed that Vyvian had been snubbing her Hilary came home late Peter and Peggy and Vyvian were sitting in the dimly lighted saloon and the ubiquitous Illuminato was curled up a sleepy ball on the marble top of a book case Peggy had a habit of leaving him lying about in convenient corners as a little girl her doll You look tired to death my dear she commented as Hilary came in Her kindly grey eyes turned from him to Peter who had looked up from the book he was reading with a nervous movement Peter s sweet tempered companionableness had been oddly obscured this evening Perhaps he too was tired to death And poor little Rhoda had been so unmercifully snubbed all the evening that at last she had crept up to bed all but in tears Peggy felt very sorry for everyone to night they all seemed to need it so much Vyvian as usual had a headache When Hilary came in he rose and said he was going upstairs to try and get some sleep an endeavour seldom successful in this noisy and jarring world one gathered Before he embarked on it he said to Peter squirting soda into a large tumbler of whisky Stefani want anything particular to day He had waited to say it till Hilary came in Peter supposed that he said it merely out of his general desire to be unpleasant and perhaps to revenge himself for that unanswered enquiry on the stairs Or possibly he merely wished to indicate to Peter how entirely he was privy to Stefani s business with Hilary and that it might just as well be discussed in his presence Or again he might be desirous of finding out how far Peter himself was in the know Peter said Nothing very particular and bent over Illuminato that he might not meet Hilary s eyes or Peggy s He knew that Hilary was violently startled and he heard Peggy s softly let out breath that might have been a sigh or a gentle whistle and that conveyed in either case dismay touched with a laugh Vyvian who had been watching the three with a covert smile drained his glass and said Well it s supposed to be partly my business you know But since you don t think so I ll say good night He included the three in a supercilious nod and left the room He left a queer silence behind him When it had lasted for a moment Peter looked up from his inspection of Illuminato s screwed up face with an effort and met Hilary s eyes searching his own Peggy was in the background later she would be a comforting easing presence but for the moment the situation held only these two and Peter s eyes pleaded to Hilary s Forgive me I am horribly sorry and in Hilary s strained face shame intolerably grew so that Peter looked away from it bending over Illuminato in his arms It was Peggy who broke the silence with a tearful laugh Oh don t look like that you poor darling boys Peter little dear Peter you must try and understand You re good at understanding you know Oh take it easy my dear Take it easy and see how it s nothing to matter how it s all one great joke after all Her arm was round his shoulders as he sat on the table s edge she was comforting him like a child To her he was always about Illuminato s age a most beloved infant Peter smiled a little at her Why yes of course it s a joke Everything is isn t it But but He was more than ever a child stammering unwordable protest blindly reaching out for help Hilary stood before him now with his hands in his pockets nervous irritable weary shame now masked by self defence That was better but still Peter kept his eyes for the curled up child My dear boy said Hilary in his sweet plaintive tones edged with irritation if people like to be taken in is it my business And Peggy echoed Yes Peter darling is it Hilary s business Then Peter laughed suddenly After all it was all too hopeless and too absurd for anything else You can t go on you know he said then You ve got to resign And Peggy looked at him in surprise for he spoke now like a man instead of a child with a man s finality He wasn t giving a command but stating an obvious fact Darling we ve got to live Peggy murmured You mayn t see the necessity Hilary ironically put the approved answer into Peter s mouth but we unfortunately do Oh don t be silly said Peter unusually You are being silly you know merely absurd Because of course it s simply a question between resigning and being chucked out before long You can t go on with this sort of thing indefinitely You see he explained apologetic now it isn t even as if you did it well You really don t And it s an awfully easy thing to see through if once anyone gets on the track All that rubbish you ve saddled Lord Evelyn with anyone who isn t as blind as a bat can spot it in a minute I did Cheriton has that s why he s so queer mannered by the way I suppose probably Denis has Well with everyone knowing about it like that someone is bound before long to ferret out the real facts Cheriton won t be long I fancy before he gets hold of it all And then and then it will be so frightfully awkward Oh you can t go on Hilary you ve got to drop it You re talking very lightly said Hilary of throwing up one s entire income Peter sighed Not lightly I m really not I know what a bore it will be but not such a bore as the other thing Well then don t throw it up simply chuck Stefani and the rest and run the thing on different lines I d help if you d let me I d chuck Leslie and stay on here and write for you I would love to I made a start to day you see I told Stefani he was out of his reckonings so he ll be prepared We ll tell all the rest the same I suppose Vyvian s in it too Can t you get rid of the man I do so dislike him you know Well never mind anyhow we ll tell him he s got to run on new lines now Oh we ll make a decent thing of the Gem after all Hilary do let s Peggy don t you think that would be jolly He looked up into his sister in law s face and met smiling eyes suddenly tear dimmed She smiled down at him Very jolly you beloved child So you ll chuck your Mr Leslie and your own profession and help to run the Gem I don t think we can let him do that Hilary can we Hilary s strained face had softened and relaxed I confess he said that it would be in many ways a great relief to me to drop that side of the business if I could see my way to it But it won t be easy now Peter It will mean a certain amount of going back on former statements for one thing Oh that ll be all right Papers are always doing that We ll manage all right and put a good face on it And we ll make the thing sell make it funny and interesting and nice Of course if Leslie is willing for me to give part of my time to it there s no reason why I should leave him as long as he stays in Venice It will be all in his interests really because he can get tips from the Gem I ve warned him off it lately because I thought you were such an awful muddler Hilary By the way it s rather a relief that you aren t quite so wanting as I was beginning to fear seriously I was wondering how on earth you were going to get through this difficult world There s no remedy for a muddler he can t mend But a swindler can a swindler certainly must that was conveyed by the appeal in Peter s tired face So tired it was that Peggy gently took Illuminato from his uncle s arms and said And now we ll all go to bed My beloved little brother you re an angel in the house and we ll all do just as you say if it s only to make you smile again Won t we Hilary She leant a soft cheek against Hilary s shoulder smiling at Peter but Peter waited for Hilary s reply before he smiled back Hilary s reply came after a moment Of course if Peter can contrive a way of keeping our heads above water without having recourse to these detestable methods I shall be only too relieved I loathe having to traffic with these dirty swindlers it s too insufferably wearying and degrading By the way Peter what did Stefani want to day Peter said Oh bother Stefani I m tired of him Really I can t remember oh yes it was antique vases that might deceive an expert But let s stop thinking about Stefani and go to bed I m so awfully sleepy do let s go upstairs and try to get a little rest as Vyvian puts it Peggy patted him softly on the cheek as he passed her and her smile for him was curiously pitiful We ll do our best to mend my dear we ll do our best was what she
