Northward along the leeward coast of Malaita the Ariel worked her leisurely way threading the colour riotous lagoon that lay between the shore reefs and outer reefs daring passages so narrow and coral patched that Captain Winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his head and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal life For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry So long as the way was interesting they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere During this time Jerry learned a new name for himself or rather an entire series of names for himself This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan s part against renaming a named thing A name he must have had he argued to Villa Haggin must have named him before he sailed on the Arangi Therefore nameless he must be until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name What s in a name Villa had begun to tease Everything her husband retorted Think of yourself shipwrecked called by your rescuers Mrs Riggs or Mademoiselle de Maupin or just plain Topsy And think of me being called Benedict Arnold or Judas or or Haman No keep him nameless until we find out his original name Must call him something she objected Can t think of him without thinking something Then call him many names but never the same name twice Call him Dog to day and Mister Dog to morrow and the next day something else So it was more by tone and emphasis and context of situation than by anything else that Jerry came hazily to identify himself with names such as Dog Mister Dog Adventurer Strong Useful One Sing Song Silly Noname and Quivering Love Heart These were a few of the many names lavished on him by Villa Harley in turn addressed him as Man Dog Incorruptible One Brass Tacks Then Some Sin of Gold South Sea Satrap Nimrod Young Nick and Lion Slayer In brief the man and woman competed with each other to name him most without naming him ever the same And Jerry less by sound and syllable than by what of their hearts vibrated in their throats soon learned to know himself by any name they chose to address to him He no longer thought of himself as Jerry but instead as any sound that sounded nice or was love sounded His great disappointment if disappointment may be considered to describe an unconsciousness of failure to realize the expected was in the matter of language No one on board not even Harley and Villa talked Nalasu s talk All Jerry s large vocabulary all his proficiency in the use of it which would have set him apart as a marvel beyond all other dogs in the mastery of speech was wasted on those of the Ariel They did not speak much less guess the existence of the whiff whuff shorthand language which Nalasu had taught him and which Nalasu dead Jerry alone knew of all living creatures in the world In vain Jerry tried it on the lady god Sitting squatted on his haunches his head bowed forward and held between her hands he would talk and talk and elicit never a responsive word from her With tiny whines and thin whimperings with whiffs and whuffs and growly sorts of noises down in his throat he would try to tell her somewhat of his tale She was all meltingness of sympathy she would hold her ear so near to the articulate mouth of him as almost to drown him in the flowing fragrance of her hair and yet her brain told her nothing of what he uttered although her heart surely sensed his intent Bless me Husband Man she would cry out The Dog is talking I know he is talking He is telling me all about himself The story of his life is mine could I but understand It s right here pouring into my miserable inadequate ears only I can t catch it Harley was sceptical but her woman s intuition guessed aright I know it she would assure her husband I tell you he could tell the tale of all his adventures if only we had understanding No other dog has ever talked this way to me There s a tale there I feel its touches Sometimes almost do I know he is telling of joy of love of high elation and combat Again it is indignation hurt of outrage despair and sadness Naturally Harley agreed quietly A white man s dog adrift among the anthropophagi of Malaita would experience all such sensations and just as naturally a white man s woman a Wife Woman a dear delightful Villa Kennan woman can of herself imagine such a dog s experiences and deem his silly noises a recital of them failing to recognize them as projections of her own delicious sensitive sympathetic self The song of the sea from the lips of the shell Pshaw The song oneself makes of the sea and puts into the shell Just the same Always the same he gallantly cut her off Always right especially when most wrong Not in navigation of course nor in affairs such as the multiplication table where the brass tacks of reality stud the way of one s ship among the rocks and shoals of the sea but right truth beyond truth to truth higher than truth namely intuitional truth Now you are laughing at me with your superior man wisdom she retorted But I know she paused for the strength of words she needed and words forsook her so that her quick sweeping gesture of hand touch to heart named authority that overrode all speech We agree I salute he laughed gaily It was just precisely what I was saying Our hearts can talk our heads down almost any time and best all our hearts are always right despite the statistic that they are mostly wrong Harley Kennan did not believe and never did believe his wife s report of the tales Jerry told And through all his days to the last one of them he considered the whole matter a pleasant fancy all poesy of sentiment on Villa s part But Jerry four legged smooth coated Irish terrier that he was had the gift of tongues If he could not teach languages at least he could learn languages Without effort and quickly practically with no teaching he began picking up the language of the Ariel Unfortunately it was not a whiff whuff dog possible language such as Nalasu had invented While Jerry came to understand much that was spoken on the Ariel he could speak none of it Three names at least he had for the lady god Villa Wife Woman Missis Kennan for so he heard her variously called But he could not so call her This was god language entire which only gods could talk It was unlike the language of Nalasu s devising which had been a compromise between god talk and dog talk so that a god and a dog could talk in the common medium In the same way he learned many names for the one man god Mister Kennan Harley Captain Kennan and Skipper Only in the intimacy of the three of them alone did Jerry hear him called Husband Man My Man Patient One Dear Man Lover and This Woman s Delight But in no way could Jerry utter these names in address of the one man nor the many names in address of the one woman Yet on a quiet night with no wind among the trees often and often had he whispered to Nalasu by whiff whuff of name from a hundred feet away One day bending over him her hair drying from a salt water swim flying about him the one woman her two hands holding his head and jowls so that his ribbon of kissing tongue just missed her nose in the empty air sang to him Don t know what to call him but he s mighty lak a rose On another day she repeated this at the same time singing most of the song to him softly in his ear In the midst of it Jerry surprised her Equally true might be the statement that he surprised himself Never had he consciously done such a thing before And he did it without volition He never intended to do it For that matter the very thing he did was what mastered him into doing it No more than could he refrain from shaking the water from his back after a swim or from kicking in his sleep when his feet were tickled could he have avoided doing this imperative thing As her voice in the song made soft vibrations in his ears it seemed to him that she grew dim and vague before him and that somehow under the soft searching prod of her song he was otherwhere So much was he otherwhere that he did the surprising thing He sat down abruptly almost cataleptically drew his head away from the clutch of her hands and out of the entanglement of her hair and his nose thrust upward at an angle of forty five degrees he began to quiver and to breathe audibly in rhythm to the rhythm of her singing With a quick jerk cataleptically his nose pointed to the zenith his mouth opened and a flood of sound poured forth running swiftly upward in crescendo and slowly falling as it died away This howl was the beginning and it led to the calling him Sing Song Silly For Villa Kennan was quick to seize upon the howling her singing induced and to develop it Never did he hang back when she sat down extended her welcoming hands to him and invited Come on Sing Song Silly He would come to her sit down with the loved fragrance of her hair in his nostrils lay the side of his head against hers point his nose past her ear and almost immediately follow her when she began her low singing Minor strains were especially provocative in getting him started and once started he would sing with her as long as she wished Singing it truly was Apt in all ways of speech he quickly learned to soften and subdue his howl till it was mellow and golden Even could he manage it to die away almost to a whisper and to rise and fall accelerate and retard in obedience to her own voice and in accord with it Jerry enjoyed the singing much in the same way the opium eater enjoys his dreams For dream he did vaguely and indistinctly eyes wide open and awake the lady god s hair in a faint scented cloud about him her voice mourning with his his consciousness drowning in the dreams of otherwhereness that came to him of the singing and that was the singing Memories of pain were his but of pain so long forgotten that it was no longer pain Rather did it permeate him with a delicious sadness and lift him away and out of the Ariel lying at anchor in some coral lagoon to that unreal place of Otherwhere For visions were his at such times In the cold bleakness of night it would seem he sat on a bare hill and raised his howl to the stars while out of the dark from far away would drift to him an answering howl And other howls near and far would drift along until the night was vocal with his kind His kind it was Without knowing it he knew it this camaraderie of the land of Otherwhere Nalasu in teaching him the whiff whuff language deliberately had gone into the intelligence of him but Villa unwitting of what she was doing went into the heart of him and into the heart of his heredity touching the profoundest chords of ancient memories and making them respond As instance dim shapes and shadowy forms would sometimes appear to him out of the night and as they flitted spectrally past he would hear as in a dream the hunting cries of the pack and as his pulse quickened his own hunting instinct would rouse until his controlled soft howling in the song broke into eager whinings His head would lower out of the entanglement of the woman s hair his feet would begin making restless spasmodic movements as if running and Presto in a flash he would be out and away across the face of time out of reality and into the dream himself running in the midst of those shadowy forms in the hunting fellowship of the pack And as men have ever desired the dust of the poppy and the juice of the hemp so Jerry desired the joys that were his when Villa Kennan opened her arms to him embraced him with her hair and sang him across time and space into the dream of his ancient kind Not always however were such experiences his when they sang together Usually unaccompanied by visions he knew no more than vaguenesses of sensations sadly sweet ghosts of memories that they were At other times incited by such sadness images of Skipper and Mister Haggin would throng his mind images too of Terrence and Biddy and Michael and the rest of the long vanished life at Meringe Plantation My dear Harley said to Villa at the conclusion of one such singing it s fortunate for him that you are not an animal trainer or rather I suppose it would be better called trained animal show woman for you d be topping the bill in all the music halls and vaudeville houses of the world If I did she replied I know he d just love to do it with me Which would make it a very unusual turn Harley caught her up You mean That in about one turn in a hundred does the animal love its work or is the animal loved by its trainer I thought all the cruelty had been done away with long ago she contended So the audience thinks and the audience is ninety nine times wrong Villa heaved a great sigh of renunciation as she said Then I suppose I must abandon such promising and lucrative career right now in the very moment you have discovered it for me Just the same the billboards would look splendid with my name in the hugest letters Villa Kennan the Thrush throated Songstress and Sing Song Silly the Irish Terrier Tenor her husband pictured the head lines for her And with dancing eyes and lolling tongue Jerry joined in the laughter not because he knew what it was about but because it tokened they were happy and his love prompted him to be happy with them For Jerry had found and in the uttermost what his nature craved the love of a god Recognizing the duality of their lordship over the Ariel he loved the pair of them yet somehow perhaps because she had penetrated deepest into his heart with her magic voice that transported him to the land of Otherwhere he loved the lady god beyond all love he had ever known not even excluding his love for Skipper leeward adj The trees all listed to leeward We steered a course to leeward
