On the th of July Charlotte now a little more than nineteen years old went as teacher to Miss W s Emily accompanied her as a pupil but she became literally ill from home sickness and could not settle to anything and after passing only three months at Roe Head returned to the parsonage and the beloved moors Miss Bront gives the following reasons as those which prevented Emily s remaining at school and caused the substitution of her younger sister in her place at Miss W s My sister Emily loved the moors Flowers brighter than the rose bloomed in the blackest of the heath for her out of a sullen hollow in a livid hill side her mind could make an Eden She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights and not the least and best loved was liberty Liberty was the breath of Emily s nostrils without it she perished The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life to one of disciplined routine though under the kindest auspices was what she failed in enduring Her nature proved here too strong for her fortitude Every morning when she woke the vision of home and the moors rushed on her and darkened and saddened the day that lay before her Nobody knew what ailed her but me I knew only too well In this struggle her health was quickly broken her white face attenuated form and failing strength threatened rapid decline I felt in my heart she would die if she did not go home and with this conviction obtained her recall She had only been three months at school and it was some years before the experiment of sending her from home was again ventured on This physical suffering on Emily s part when absent from Haworth after recurring several times under similar circumstances became at length so much an acknowledged fact that whichever was obliged to leave home the sisters decided that Emily must remain there where alone she could enjoy anything like good health She left it twice again in her life once going as teacher to a school in Halifax for six months and afterwards accompanying Charlotte to Brussels for ten When at home she took the principal part of the cooking upon herself and did all the household ironing and after Tabby grew old and infirm it was Emily who made all the bread for the family and any one passing by the kitchen door might have seen her studying German out of an open book propped up before her as she kneaded the dough but no study however interesting interfered with the goodness of the bread which was always light and excellent Books were indeed a very common sight in that kitchen the girls were taught by their father theoretically and by their aunt practically that to take an active part in all household work was in their position woman s simple duty but in their careful employment of time they found many an odd five minutes for reading while watching the cakes and managed the union of two kinds of employment better than King Alfred Charlotte s life at Miss W s was a very happy one until her health failed She sincerely loved and respected the former schoolmistress to whom she was now become both companion and friend The girls were hardly strangers to her some of them being younger sisters of those who had been her own playmates Though the duties of the day might be tedious and monotonous there were always two or three happy hours to look forward to in the evening when she and Miss W sat together sometimes late into the night and had quiet pleasant conversations or pauses of silence as agreeable because each felt that as soon as a thought or remark occurred which they wished to express there was an intelligent companion ready to sympathise and yet they were not compelled to make talk Miss W was always anxious to afford Miss Bront every opportunity of recreation in her power but the difficulty often was to persuade her to avail herself of the invitations which came urging her to spend Saturday and Sunday with E and Mary in their respective homes that lay within the distance of a walk She was too apt to consider that allowing herself a holiday was a dereliction of duty and to refuse herself the necessary change from something of an over ascetic spirit betokening a loss of healthy balance in either body or mind Indeed it is clear that such was the case from a passage referring to this time in the letter of Mary from which I have before given extracts Three years after the period when they were at school together I heard that she had gone as teacher to Miss W s I went to see her and asked how she could give so much for so little money when she could live without it She owned that after clothing herself and Anne there was nothing left though she had hoped to be able to save something She confessed it was not brilliant but what could she do I had nothing to answer She seemed to have no interest or pleasure beyond the feeling of duty and when she could get used to sit alone and make out She told me afterwards that one evening she had sat in the dressing room until it was quite dark and then observing it all at once had taken sudden fright No doubt she remembered this well when she described a similar terror getting hold upon Jane Eyre She says in the story I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls occasionally turning a fascinated eye towards the gleaming mirror I began to recall what I had heard of dead men troubled in their graves I endeavoured to be firm shaking my hair from my eyes I lifted my head and tried to look boldly through the dark room at this moment a ray from the moon penetrated some aperture in the blind No moon light was still and this stirred prepared as my mind was for horror shaken as my nerves were by agitation I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world My heart beat thick my head grew hot a sound filled my ears which I deemed the rustling of wings something seemed near me From that time Mary adds her imaginations became gloomy or frightful she could not help it nor help thinking She could not forget the gloom could not sleep at night nor attend in the day She told me that one night sitting alone about this time she heard a voice repeat these lines Come thou high and holy feeling Shine o er mountain flit o er wave Gleam like light o er dome and shielding There were eight or ten more lines which I forget She insisted that she had not made them that she had heard a voice repeat them It is possible that she had read them and unconsciously recalled them They are not in the volume of poems which the sisters published She repeated a verse of Isaiah which she said had inspired them and which I have forgotten Whether the lines were recollected or invented the tale proves such habits of sedentary monotonous solitude of thought as would have shaken a feebler mind Of course the state of health thus described came on gradually and is not to be taken as a picture of her condition in Yet even then there is a despondency in some of her expressions that too sadly reminds one of some of Cowper s letters And it is remarkable how deeply his poems impressed her His words his verses came more frequently to her memory I imagine than those of any other poet Mary says Cowper s poem The Castaway was known to them all and they all at times appreciated or almost appropriated it Charlotte told me once that Branwell had done so and though his depression was the result of his faults it was in no other respect different from hers Both were not mental but physical illnesses She was well aware of this and would ask how that mended matters as the feeling was there all the same and was not removed by knowing the cause She had a larger religious toleration than a person would have who had never questioned and the manner of recommending religion was always that of offering comfort not fiercely enforcing a duty One time I mentioned that some one had asked me what religion I was of with the view of getting me for a partizan and that I had said that that was between God and me Emily who was lying on the hearth rug exclaimed That s right This was all I ever heard Emily say on religious subjects Charlotte was free from religious depression when in tolerable health when that failed her depression returned You have probably seen such instances They don t get over their difficulties they forget them when their stomach or whatever organ it is that inflicts such misery on sedentary people will let them I have heard her condemn Socinianism Calvinism and many other isms inconsistent with Church of Englandism I used to wonder at her acquaintance with such subjects May th I was struck with the note you sent me with the umbrella it showed a degree of interest in my concerns which I have no right to expect from any earthly creature I won t play the hypocrite I won t answer your kind gentle friendly questions in the way you wish me to Don t deceive yourself by imagining I have a bit of real goodness about me My darling if I were like you I should have my face Zion ward though prejudice and error might occasionally fling a mist over the glorious vision before me but I am not like you If you knew my thoughts the dreams that absorb me and the fiery imagination that at times eats me up and makes me feel society as it is wretchedly insipid you would pity and I dare say despise me But I know the treasures of the Bible I love and adore them I can see the Well of Life in all its clearness and brightness but when I stoop down to drink of the pure waters they fly from my lips as if I were Tantalus You are far too kind and frequent in your invitations You puzzle me I hardly know how to refuse and it is still more embarrassing to accept At any rate I cannot come this week for we are in the very thickest mel e of the Repetitions I was hearing the terrible fifth section when your note arrived But Miss Wooler says I must go to Mary next Friday as she promised for me on Whit Sunday and on Sunday morning I will join you at church if it be convenient and stay till Monday There s a free and easy proposal Miss W has driven me to it She says her character is implicated Good kind Miss W however monotonous and trying were the duties Charlotte had to perform under her roof there was always a genial and thoughtful friend watching over her and urging her to partake of any little piece of innocent recreation that might come in her way And in those Midsummer holidays of her friend E came to stay with her at Haworth so there was one happy time secured Here follows a series of letters not dated but belonging to the latter portion of this year and again we think of the gentle and melancholy Cowper My dear dear E I am at this moment trembling all over with excitement after reading your note it is what I never received before it is the unrestrained pouring out of a warm gentle generous heart I thank you with energy for this kindness I will no longer shrink from answering your questions I do wish to be better than I am I pray fervently sometimes to be made so I have stings of conscience visitings of remorse glimpses of holy of inexpressible things which formerly I used to be a stranger to it may all die away and I may be in utter midnight but I implore a merciful Redeemer that if this be the dawn of the gospel it may still brighten to perfect day Do not mistake me do not think I am good I only wish to be so I only hate my former flippancy and forwardness Oh I am no better than ever I was I am in that state of horrid gloomy uncertainty that at this moment I would submit to be old grey haired to have passed all my youthful days of enjoyment and to be settling on the verge of the grave if I could only thereby ensure the prospect of reconciliation to God and redemption through his Son s merits I never was exactly careless of these matters but I have always taken a clouded and repulsive view of them and now if possible the clouds are gathering darker and a more oppressive despondency weighs on my spirits You have cheered me my darling for one moment for an atom of time I thought I might call you my own sister in the spirit but the excitement is past and I am now as wretched and hopeless as ever This very night I will pray as you wish me May the Almighty hear me compassionately and I humbly hope he will for you will strengthen my polluted petitions with your own pure requests All is bustle and confusion round me the ladies pressing with their sums and their lessons If you love me do do do come on Friday I shall watch and wait for you and if you disappoint me I shall weep I wish you could know the thrill of delight which I experienced when as I stood at the dining room window I saw as he whirled past toss your little packet over the wall Huddersfield market day was still the great period for events at Roe Head Then girls running round the corner of the house and peeping between tree stems and up a shadowy lane could catch a glimpse of a father or brother driving to market in his gig might perhaps exchange a wave of the hand or see as Charlotte Bront did from the window a white packet tossed over the avail by come swift strong motion of an arm the rest of the traveller s body unseen Weary with a day s hard work I am sitting down to write a few lines to my dear E Excuse me if I say nothing but nonsense for my mind is exhausted and dispirited It is a stormy evening and the wind is uttering a continual moaning sound that makes me feel very melancholy At such times in such moods as these it is my nature to seek repose in some calm tranquil idea and I have now summoned up your image to give me rest There you sit upright and still in your black dress and white scarf and pale marble like face just like reality I wish you would speak to me If we should be separated if it should be our lot to live at a great distance and never to see each other again in old age how I should conjure up the memory of my youthful days and what a melancholy pleasure I should feel in dwelling on the recollection of my early friend I have some qualities that make me very miserable some feelings that you can have no participation in that few very few people in the world can at all understand I don t pride myself on these peculiarities I strive to conceal and suppress them as much as I can but they burst out sometimes and then those who see the explosion despise me and I hate myself for days afterwards I have just received your epistle and what accompanied it I can t tell what should induce you and your sisters to waste your kindness on such a one as me I m obliged to them and I hope you ll tell them so I m obliged to you also more for your note than for your present The first gave me pleasure the last something like pain The nervous disturbance which is stated to have troubled her while she was at Miss W s seems to have begun to distress her about this time at least she herself speaks of her irritable condition which was certainly only a temporary ailment You have been very kind to me of late and have spared me all those little sallies of ridicule which owing to my miserable and wretched touchiness of character used formerly to make me wince as if I had been touched with a hot iron things that nobody else cares for enter into my mind and rankle there like venom I know these feelings are absurd and therefore I try to hide them but they only sting the deeper for concealment Compare this state of mind with the gentle resignation with which she had submitted to be put aside as useless or told of her ugliness by her school fellows only three years before My life since I saw you has passed as monotonously and unbroken as ever nothing but teach teach teach from morning till night The greatest variety I ever have is afforded by a letter from you or by meeting with a pleasant new book The Life of Oberlin and Leigh Richmond s Domestic Portraiture are the last of this description The latter work strongly attracted and strangely fascinated my attention Beg borrow or steal it without delay and read the Memoir of Wilberforce that short record of a brief uneventful life I shall never forget it it is beautiful not on account of the language in which it is written not on account of the incidents it details but because of the simple narrative it gives of a young talented sincere Christian About this time Miss W removed her school from the fine open breezy situation of Roe Head to Dewsbury Moor only two or three miles distant Her new residence was on a lower site and the air was less exhilarating to one bred in the wild hill village of Haworth Emily had gone as teacher to a school at Halifax where there were nearly forty pupils I have had one letter from her since her departure writes Charlotte on October nd it gives an appalling account of her duties hard labour from six in the morning to eleven at night with only one half hour of exercise between This is slavery I fear she can never stand it When the sisters met at home in the Christmas holidays they talked over their lives and the prospect which they afforded of employment and remuneration They felt that it was a duty to relieve their father of the burden of their support if not entirely or that of all three at least that of one or two and naturally the lot devolved upon the elder ones to find some occupation which would enable them to do this They knew that they were never likely to inherit much money Mr Bront had but a small stipend and was both charitable and liberal Their aunt had an annuity of l but it reverted to others at her death and her nieces had no right and were the last persons in the world to reckon upon her savings What could they do Charlotte and Emily were trying teaching and as it seemed without much success The former it is true had the happiness of having a friend for her employer and of being surrounded by those who knew her and loved her but her salary was too small for her to save out of it and her education did not entitle her to a larger The sedentary and monotonous nature of the life too was preying upon her health and spirits although with necessity as her mistress she might hardly like to acknowledge this even to herself But Emily that free wild untameable spirit never happy nor well but on the sweeping moors that gathered round her home that hater of strangers doomed to live amongst them and not merely to live but to slave in their service what Charlotte could have borne patiently for herself she could not bear for her sister And yet what to do She had once hoped that she herself might become an artist and so earn her livelihood but her eyes had failed her in the minute and useless labour which she had imposed upon herself with a view to this end It was the household custom among these girls to sew till nine o clock at night At that hour Miss Branwell generally went to bed and her nieces duties for the day were accounted done They put away their work and began to pace the room backwards and forwards up and down as often with the candles extinguished for economy s sake as not their figures glancing into the fire light and out into the shadow perpetually At this time they talked over past cares and troubles they planned for the future and consulted each other as to their plans In after years this was the time for discussing together the plots of their novels And again still later this was the time for the last surviving sister to walk alone from old accustomed habit round and round the desolate room thinking sadly upon the days that were no more But this Christmas of was not without its hopes and daring aspirations They had tried their hands at story writing in their miniature magazine long ago they all of them made out perpetually They had likewise attempted to write poetry and had a modest confidence that they had achieved a tolerable success But they knew that they might deceive themselves and that sisters judgments of each other s productions were likely to be too partial to be depended upon So Charlotte as the eldest resolved to write to Southey I believe from an expression in a letter to be noticed hereafter that she also consulted Coleridge but I have not met with any part of that correspondence On December th her letter to Southey was despatched and from an excitement not unnatural in a girl who has worked herself up to the pitch of writing to a Poet Laureate and asking his opinion of her poems she used some high flown expressions which probably gave him the idea that she was a romantic young lady unacquainted with the realities of life This most likely was the first of those adventurous letters that passed through the little post office of Haworth Morning after morning of the holidays slipped away and there was no answer the sisters had to leave home and Emily to return to her distasteful duties without knowing even whether Charlotte s letter had ever reached its destination Not dispirited however by the delay Branwell determined to try a similar venture and addressed the following letter to Wordsworth It was given by the poet to Mr Quillinan in after the name of Bront had become known and famous I have no means of ascertaining what answer was returned by Mr Wordsworth but that he considered the letter remarkable may I think be inferred both from its preservation and its recurrence to his memory when the real name of Currer Bell was made known to the public Haworth near Bradford Yorkshire January Sir I most earnestly entreat you to read and pass your judgment upon what I have sent you because from the day of my birth to this the nineteenth year of my life I have lived among secluded hills where I could neither know what I was or what I could do I read for the same reason that I ate or drank because it was a real craving of nature I wrote on the same principle as I spoke out of the impulse and feelings of the mind nor could I help it for what came came out and there was the end of it For as to self conceit that could not receive food from flattery since to this hour not half a dozen people in the world know that I have ever penned a line But a change has taken place now sir and I am arrived at an age wherein I must do something for myself the powers I possess must be exercised to a definite end and as I don t know them myself I must ask of others what they are worth Yet there is not one here to tell me and still if they are worthless time will henceforth be too precious to be wasted on them Do pardon me sir that I have ventured to come before one whose works I have most loved in our literature and who most has been with me a divinity of the mind laying before him one of my writings and asking of him a judgment of its contents I must come before some one from whose sentence there is no appeal and such a one is he who has developed the theory of poetry as well as its practice and both in such a way as to claim a place in the memory of a thousand years to come My aim sir is to push out into the open world and for this I trust not poetry alone that might launch the vessel but could not bear her on sensible and scientific prose bold and vigorous efforts in my walk in life would give a farther title to the notice of the world and then again poetry ought to brighten and crown that name with glory but nothing of all this can be ever begun without means and as I don t possess these I must in every shape strive to gain them Surely in this day when there is not a writing poet worth a sixpence the field must be open if a better man can step forward What I send you is the Prefatory Scene of a much longer subject in which I have striven to develop strong passions and weak principles struggling with a high imagination and acute feelings till as youth hardens towards age evil deeds and short enjoyments end in mental misery and bodily ruin Now to send you the whole of this would be a mock upon your patience what you see does not even pretend to be more than the description of an imaginative child But read it sir and as you would hold a light to one in utter darkness as you value your own kindheartedness return me an answer if but one word telling me whether I should write on or write no more Forgive undue warmth because my feelings in this matter cannot be cool and believe me sir with deep respect Your really humble servant P B Bront The poetry enclosed seems to me by no means equal to parts of the letter but as every one likes to judge for himself I copy the six opening stanzas about a third of the whole and certainly not the worst So where he reigns in glory bright Above those starry skies of night Amid his Paradise of light Oh why may I not be Oft when awake on Christmas morn In sleepless twilight laid forlorn Strange thoughts have o er my mind been borne How he has died for me And oft within my chamber lying Have I awaked myself with crying From dreams where I beheld Him dying Upon the accursed Tree And often has my mother said While on her lap I laid my head She feared for time I was not made But for Eternity So I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies And let me bid farewell to fear And wipe my weeping eyes I ll lay me down on this marble stone And set the world aside To see upon her ebon throne The Moon in glory ride Soon after Charlotte returned to Dewsbury Moor she was distressed by hearing that her friend E was likely to leave the neighbourhood for a considerable length of time Feb th What shall I do without you How long are we likely to be separated Why are we to be denied each other s society It is an inscrutable fatality I long to be with you because it seems as if two or three days or weeks spent in your company would beyond measure strengthen me in the enjoyment of those feelings which I have so lately begun to cherish You first pointed out to me that way in which I am so feebly endeavouring to travel and now I cannot keep you by my side I must proceed sorrowfully alone Why are we to be divided Surely it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the Creator in idolatry of the creature At first I could not say Thy will be done I felt rebellious but I knew it was wrong to feel so Being left a moment alone this morning I prayed fervently to be enabled to resign myself to every decree of God s will though it should be dealt forth by a far severer hand than the present disappointment since then I have felt calmer and humbler and consequently happier Last Sunday I took up my Bible in a gloomy state of mind I began to read a feeling stole over me such as I have not known for many long years a sweet placid sensation like those I remember which used to visit me when I was a little child and on Sunday evenings in summer stood by the open window reading the life of a certain French nobleman who attained a purer and higher degree of sanctity than has been known since the days of the early martyrs E s residence was equally within a walk from Dewsbury Moor as it had been from Roe Head and on Saturday afternoons both Mary and she used to call upon Charlotte and often endeavoured to persuade her to return with them and be the guest of one of them till Monday morning but this was comparatively seldom Mary says She visited us twice or thrice when she was at Miss W s We used to dispute about politics and religion She a Tory and clergyman s daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent Dissent and Radicalism She used to hear over again delivered with authority all the lectures I had been used to give her at school on despotic aristocracy mercenary priesthood c She had not energy to defend herself sometimes she owned to a little truth in it but generally said nothing Her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle Thus she would let me advise and patronise most imperiously sometimes picking out any grain of sense there might be in what I said but never allowing any one materially to interfere with her independence of thought and action Though her silence sometimes left one under the impression that she agreed when she did not she never gave a flattering opinion and thus her words were golden whether for praise or blame Mary s father was a man of remarkable intelligence but of strong not to say violent prejudices all running in favour of Republicanism and Dissent No other county but Yorkshire could have produced such a man His brother had been a d tenu in France and had afterwards voluntarily taken up his residence there Mr T himself had been much abroad both on business and to see the great continental galleries of paintings He spoke French perfectly I have been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest Yorkshire He bought splendid engravings of the pictures which he particularly admired and his house was full of works of art and of books but he rather liked to present his rough side to any stranger or new comer he would speak his broadest bring out his opinions on Church and State in their most startling forms and by and by if he found his hearer could stand the shock he would involuntarily show his warm kind heart and his true taste and real refinement His family of four sons and two daughters were brought up on Republican principles independence of thought and action was encouraged no shams tolerated They are scattered far and wide Martha the younger daughter sleeps in the Protestant cemetery at Brussels Mary is in New Zealand Mr T is dead And so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent Radicals and Dissenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergyman s daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured January and February of had passed away and still there was no reply from Southey Probably she had lost expectation and almost hope when at length in the beginning of March she received the letter inserted in Mr C C Southey s life of his Father vol iv p After accounting for his delay in replying to hers by the fact of a long absence from home during which his letters had accumulated whence it has lain unanswered till the last of a numerous file not from disrespect or indifference to its contents but because in truth it is not an easy task to answer it nor a pleasant one to cast a damp over the high spirits and the generous desires of youth he goes on to say What you are I can only infer from your letter which appears to be written in sincerity though I may suspect that you have used a fictitious signature Be that as it may the letter and the verses bear the same stamp and I can well understand the state of mind they indicate It is not my advice that you have asked as to the direction of your talents but my opinion of them and yet the opinion may be worth little and the advice much You evidently possess and in no inconsiderable degree what Wordsworth calls the faculty of verse I am not depreciating it when I say that in these times it is not rare Many volumes of poems are now published every year without attracting public attention any one of which if it had appeared half a century ago would have obtained a high reputation for its author Whoever therefore is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness I who have made literature my profession and devoted my life to it and have never for a moment repented of the deliberate choice think myself nevertheless bound in duty to caution every young man who applies as an aspirant to me for encouragement and advice against taking so perilous a course You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her In a certain sense this is true but there is a danger of which I would with all kindness and all earnestness warn you The day dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely to induce a distempered state of mind and in proportion as all the ordinary uses of the world seem to you flat and unprofitable you will be unfitted for them without becoming fitted for anything else Literature cannot be the business of a woman s life and it ought not to be The more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation To those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity You will not seek in imagination for excitement of which the vicissitudes of this life and the anxieties from which you must not hope to be exempted be your state what it may will bring with them but too much But do not suppose that I disparage the gift which you possess nor that I would discourage you from exercising it I only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good Write poetry for its own sake not in a spirit of emulation and not with a view to celebrity the less you aim at that the more likely you will be to deserve and finally to obtain it So written it is wholesome both for the heart and soul it may be made the surest means next to religion of soothing the mind and elevating it You may embody in it your best thoughts and your wisest feelings and in so doing discipline and strengthen them Farewell madam It is not because I have forgotten that I was once young myself that I write to you in this strain but because I remember it You will neither doubt my sincerity nor my good will and however ill what has here been said may accord with your present views and temper the longer you live the more reasonable it will appear to you Though I may be but an ungracious adviser you will allow me therefore to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your true friend ROBERT SOUTHEY I was with Miss Bront when she received Mr Cuthbert Southey s note requesting her permission to insert the foregoing letter in his father s life She said to me Mr Southey s letter was kind and admirable a little stringent but it did me good It is partly because I think it so admirable and partly because it tends to bring out her character as shown in the following reply that I have taken the liberty of inserting the foregoing extracts from it Sir March th I cannot rest till I have answered your letter even though by addressing you a second time I should appear a little intrusive but I must thank you for the kind and wise advice you have condescended to give me I had not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit I must suppress what I feel or you will think me foolishly enthusiastic At the first perusal of your letter I felt only shame and regret that I had ever ventured to trouble you with my crude rhapsody I felt a painful heat rise to my face when I thought of the quires of paper I had covered with what once gave me so much delight but which now was only a source of confusion but after I had thought a little and read it again and again the prospect seemed to clear You do not forbid me to write you do not say that what I write is utterly destitute of merit You only warn me against the folly of neglecting real duties for the sake of imaginative pleasures of writing for the love of fame for the selfish excitement of emulation You kindly allow me to write poetry for its own sake provided I leave undone nothing which I ought to do in order to pursue that single absorbing exquisite gratification I am afraid sir you think me very foolish I know the first letter I wrote to you was all senseless trash from beginning to end but I am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote My father is a clergyman of limited though competent income and I am the eldest of his children He expended quite as much in my education as he could afford in justice to the rest I thought it therefore my duty when I left school to become a governess In that capacity I find enough to occupy my thoughts all day long and my head and hands too without having a moment s time for one dream of the imagination In the evenings I confess I do think but I never trouble any one else with my thoughts I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity which might lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits Following my father s advice who from my childhood has counselled me just in the wise and friendly tone of your letter I have endeavoured not only attentively to observe all the duties a woman ought to fulfil but to feel deeply interested in them I don t always succeed for sometimes when I m teaching or sewing I would rather be reading or writing but I try to deny myself and my father s approbation amply rewarded me for the privation Once more allow me to thank you with sincere gratitude I trust I shall never more feel ambitious to see my name in print if the wish should rise I ll look at Southey s letter and suppress it It is honour enough for me that I have written to him and received an answer That letter is consecrated no one shall ever see it but papa and my brother and sisters Again I thank you This incident I suppose will be renewed no more if I live to be an old woman I shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream The signature which you suspected of being fictitious is my real name Again therefore I must sign myself C Bront P S Pray sir excuse me for writing to you a second time I could not help writing partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted however sorrowfully and reluctantly it may be at first followed C B I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting Southey s reply Keswick March Dear Madam Your letter has given me great pleasure and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so You have received admonition as considerately and as kindly as it was given Let me now request that if you ever should come to these Lakes while I am living here you will let me see you You would then think of me afterwards with the more good will because you would perceive that there is neither severity nor moroseness in the state of mind to which years and observation have brought me It is by God s mercy in our power to attain a degree of self government which is essential to our own happiness and contributes greatly to that of those around us Take care of over excitement and endeavour to keep a quiet mind even for your health it is the best advice that can be given you your moral and spiritual improvement will then keep pace with the culture of your intellectual powers And now madam God bless you Farewell and believe me to be your sincere friend ROBERT SOUTHEY Of this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the Lakes But there was no money to spare said she nor any prospect of my ever earning money enough to have the chance of so great a pleasure so I gave up thinking of it At the time we conversed together on the subject we were at the Lakes But Southey was dead This stringent letter made her put aside for a time all idea of literary enterprise She bent her whole energy towards the fulfilment of the duties in hand but her occupation was not sufficient food for her great forces of intellect and they cried out perpetually Give give while the comparatively less breezy air of Dewsbury Moor told upon her health and spirits more and more On August she writes I am again at Dewsbury engaged in the old business teach teach teach When will you come home Make haste You have been at Bath long enough for all purposes by this time you have acquired polish enough I am sure if the varnish is laid on much thicker I am afraid the good wood underneath will be quite concealed and your Yorkshire friends won t stand that Come come I am getting really tired of your absence Saturday after Saturday comes round and I can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that Miss E is come Oh dear in this monotonous life of mine that was a pleasant event I wish it would recur again but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness the estrangement of this long separation will wear away About this time she forgot to return a work bag she had borrowed by a messenger and in repairing her error she says These aberrations of memory warn me pretty intelligibly that I am getting past my prime AEtat And the same tone of despondency runs through the following letter I wish exceedingly that I could come to you before Christmas but it is impossible another three weeks must elapse before I shall again have my comforter beside me under the roof of my own dear quiet home If I could always live with you and daily read the Bible with you if your lips and mine could at the same time drink the same draught from the same pure fountain of mercy I hope I trust I might one day become better far better than my evil wandering thoughts my corrupt heart cold to the spirit and warm to the flesh will now permit me to be I often plan the pleasant life which we might lead together strengthening each other in that power of self denial that hallowed and glowing devotion which the first saints of God often attained to My eyes fill with tears when I contrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state I now live in uncertain that I ever felt true contrition wandering in thought and deed longing for holiness which I shall never never obtain smitten at times to the heart with the conviction that ghastly Calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death If Christian perfection be necessary to salvation I shall never be saved my heart is a very hotbed for sinful thoughts and when I decide on an action I scarcely remember to look to my Redeemer for direction I know not how to pray I cannot bend my life to the grand end of doing good I go on constantly seeking my own pleasure pursuing the gratification of my own desires I forget God and will not God forget me And meantime I know the greatness of Jehovah I acknowledge the perfection of His word I adore the purity of the Christian faith my theory is right my practice horribly wrong The Christmas holidays came and she and Anne returned to the parsonage and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people they shrivelled up more or less Indeed there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result Emily and Anne were bound up in their lives and interests like twins The former from reserve the latter from timidity avoided all friendships and intimacies beyond their family Emily was impervious to influence she never came in contact with public opinion and her own decision of what was right and fitting was a law for her conduct and appearance with which she allowed no one to interfere Her love was poured out on Anne as Charlotte s was on her But the affection among all the three was stronger than either death or life E was eagerly welcomed by Charlotte freely admitted by Emily and kindly received by Anne whenever she could visit them and this Christmas she had promised to do so but her coming had to be delayed on account of a little domestic accident detailed in the following letter Dec I am sure you will have thought me very remiss in not sending my promised letter long before now but I have a sufficient and very melancholy excuse in an accident that befell our old faithful Tabby a few days after my return home She was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell it was dark and no one saw her mischance till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer by She was lifted up and carried into the druggist s near and after the examination it was discovered that she had completely shattered and dislocated one leg Unfortunately the fracture could not be set till six o clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state Of course we are all exceedingly distressed at the circumstance for she was like one of our own family Since the event we have been almost without assistance a person has dropped in now and then to do the drudgery but we have as yet been able to procure no regular servant and consequently the whole work of the house as well as the additional duty of nursing Tabby falls on ourselves Under these circumstances I dare not press your visit here at least until she is pronounced out of danger it would be too selfish of me Aunt wished me to give you this information before but papa and all the rest were anxious I should delay until we saw whether matters took a more settled aspect and I myself kept putting it off from day to day most bitterly reluctant to give up all the pleasure I had anticipated so long However remembering what you told me namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision than ours and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be I hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent it may be all for the best I fear if you had been here during this severe weather your visit would have been of no advantage to you for the moors are blockaded with snow and you would never have been able to get out After this disappointment I never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me I am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society I would urge your visit yet I would entreat and press it but the thought comes across me should Tabby die while you are in the house I should never forgive myself No it must not be and in a thousand ways the consciousness of that mortifies and disappoints me most keenly and I am not the only one who is disappointed All in the house were looking to your visit with eagerness Papa says he highly approves of my friendship with you and he wishes me to continue it through life A good neighbour of the Bront s a clever intelligent Yorkshire woman who keeps a druggist s shop in Haworth and from her occupation her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctress and nurse and as such has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with Tabby s fractured leg Mr Bront is truly generous and regardful of all deserving claims Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was as Charlotte expressed it one of the family But on the other hand she was past the age for any very active service being nearer seventy than sixty at the time of the accident she had a sister living in the village and the savings she had accumulated during many years service formed a competency for one in her rank of life Or if in this time of sickness she fell short of any comforts which her state rendered necessary the parsonage could supply them So reasoned Miss Branwell the prudent not to say anxious aunt looking to the limited contents of Mr Bront s purse and the unprovided for future of her nieces who were moreover losing the relaxation of the holidays in close attendance upon Tabby Miss Branwell urged her views upon Mr Bront as soon as the immediate danger to the old servant s life was over He refused at first to listen to the careful advice it was repugnant to his liberal nature But Miss Branwell persevered urged economical motives pressed on his love for his daughters He gave way Tabby was to be removed to her sister s and there nursed and cared for Mr Bront coming in with his aid when her own resources fell short This decision was communicated to the girls There were symptoms of a quiet but sturdy rebellion that winter afternoon in the small precincts of Haworth parsonage They made one unanimous and stiff remonstrance Tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity and age At tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three So it was at breakfast they did not waste many words on the subject but each word they did utter was weighty They struck eating till the resolution was rescinded and Tabby was allowed to remain a helpless invalid entirely dependent upon them Herein was the strong feeling of Duty being paramount to pleasure which lay at the foundation of Charlotte s character made most apparent for we have seen how she yearned for her friend s company but it was to be obtained only by shrinking from what she esteemed right and that she never did whatever might be the sacrifice She had another weight on her mind this Christmas I have said that the air of Dewsbury Moor did not agree with her though she herself was hardly aware how much her life there was affecting her health But Anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays and Charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young Anne had a slight cough a pain at her side a difficulty of breathing Miss W considered it as little more than a common cold but Charlotte felt every indication of incipient consumption as a stab at her heart remembering Maria and Elizabeth whose places once knew them and should know them no more Stung by anxiety for this little sister she upbraided Miss W for her fancied indifference to Anne s state of health Miss W felt these reproaches keenly and wrote to Mr Bront about them He immediately replied most kindly expressing his fear that Charlotte s apprehensions and anxieties respecting her sister had led her to give utterance to over excited expressions of alarm Through Miss W s kind consideration Anne was a year longer at school than her friends intended At the close of the half year Miss W sought for the opportunity of an explanation of each other s words and the issue proved that the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love And so ended the first last and only difference Charlotte ever had with good kind Miss W Still her heart had received a shock in the perception of Anne s delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing fond anxiety which is so full of sudden pangs of fear Emily had given up her situation in the Halifax school at the expiration of six months of arduous trial on account of her health which could only be re established by the bracing moorland air and free life of home Tabby s illness had preyed on the family resources I doubt whether Branwell was maintaining himself at this time For some unexplained reason he had given up the idea of becoming a student of painting at the Royal Academy and his prospects in life were uncertain and had yet to be settled So Charlotte had quietly to take up her burden of teaching again and return to her previous monotonous life Brave heart ready to die in harness She went back to her work and made no complaint hoping to subdue the weakness that was gaining ground upon her About this time she would turn sick and trembling at any sudden noise and could hardly repress her screams when startled This showed a fearful degree of physical weakness in one who was generally so self controlled and the medical man whom at length through Miss W s entreaty she was led to consult insisted on her return to the parsonage She had led too sedentary a life he said and the soft summer air blowing round her home the sweet company of those she loved the release the freedom of life in her own family were needed to save either reason or life So as One higher than she had over ruled that for a time she might relax her strain she returned to Haworth and after a season of utter quiet her father sought for her the enlivening society of her two friends Mary and Martha T At the conclusion of the following letter written to the then absent E there is I think as pretty a glimpse of a merry group of young people as need be and like all descriptions of doing as distinct from thinking or feeling in letters it saddens one in proportion to the vivacity of the picture of what was once and is now utterly swept away Haworth June I received your packet of despatches on Wednesday it was brought me by Mary and Martha who have been staying at Haworth for a few days they leave us to day You will be surprised at the date of this letter I ought to be at Dewsbury Moor you know but I stayed as long as I was able and at length I neither could nor dared stay any longer My health and spirits had utterly failed me and the medical man whom I consulted enjoined me as I valued my life to go home So home I went and the change has at once roused and soothed me and I am now I trust fairly in the way to be myself again A calm and even mind like yours cannot conceive the feelings of the shattered wretch who is now writing to you when after weeks of mental and bodily anguish not to be described something like peace began to dawn again Mary is far from well She breathes short has a pain in her chest and frequent flushings of fever I cannot tell you what agony these symptoms give me they remind me too strongly of my two sisters whom no power of medicine could save Martha is now very well she has kept in a continual flow of good humour during her stay here and has consequently been very fascinating They are making such a noise about me I cannot write any more Mary is playing on the piano Martha is chattering as fast as her little tongue can run and Branwell is standing before her laughing at her vivacity Charlotte grew much stronger in this quiet happy period at home She paid occasional visits to her two great friends and they in return came to Haworth At one of their houses I suspect she met with the person to whom the following letter refers some one having a slight resemblance to the character of St John in the last volume of Jane Eyre and like him in holy orders March I had a kindly leaning towards him because he is an amiable and well disposed man Yet I had not and could not have that intense attachment which would make me willing to die for him and if ever I marry it must be in that light of adoration that I will regard my husband Ten to one I shall never have the chance again but n importe Moreover I was aware that he knew so little of me he could hardly be conscious to whom he was writing Why it would startle him to see me in my natural home character he would think I was a wild romantic enthusiast indeed I could not sit all day long making a grave face before my husband I would laugh and satirize and say whatever came into my head first And if he were a clever man and loved me the whole world weighed in the balance against his smallest wish should be light as air So that her first proposal of marriage was quietly declined and put on one side Matrimony did not enter into the scheme of her life but good sound earnest labour did the question however was as yet undecided in what direction she should employ her forces She had been discouraged in literature her eyes failed her in the minute kind of drawing which she practised when she wanted to express an idea teaching seemed to her at this time as it does to most women at all times the only way of earning an independent livelihood But neither she nor her sisters were naturally fond of children The hieroglyphics of childhood were an unknown language to them for they had never been much with those younger than themselves I am inclined to think too that they had not the happy knack of imparting information which seems to be a separate gift from the faculty of acquiring it a kind of sympathetic tact which instinctively perceives the difficulties that impede comprehension in a child s mind and that yet are too vague and unformed for it with its half developed powers of expression to explain by words Consequently teaching very young children was anything but a delightful task to the three Bront sisters With older girls verging on womanhood they might have done better especially if these had any desire for improvement But the education which the village clergyman s daughters had received did not as yet qualify them to undertake the charge of advanced pupils They knew but little French and were not proficients in music I doubt whether Charlotte could play at all But they were all strong again and at any rate Charlotte and Anne must put their shoulders to the wheel One daughter was needed at home to stay with Mr Bront and Miss Branwell to be the young and active member in a household of four whereof three the father the aunt and faithful Tabby were past middle age And Emily who suffered and drooped more than her sisters when away from Haworth was the one appointed to remain Anne was the first to meet with a situation April th I could not write to you in the week you requested as about that time we were very busy in preparing for Anne s departure Poor child she left us last Monday no one went with her it was her own wish that she might be allowed to go alone as she thought she could manage better and summon more courage if thrown entirely upon her own resources We have had one letter from her since she went She expresses herself very well satisfied and says that Mrs is extremely kind the two eldest children alone are under her care the rest are confined to the nursery with which and its occupants she has nothing to do I hope she ll do You would be astonished what a sensible clever letter she writes it is only the talking part that I fear But I do seriously apprehend that Mrs will sometimes conclude that she has a natural impediment in her speech For my own part I am as yet wanting a situation like a housemaid out of place By the way I have lately discovered I have quite a talent for cleaning sweeping up hearths dusting rooms making beds c so if everything else fails I can turn my hand to that if anybody will give me good wages for little labour I won t be a cook I hate soothing I won t be a nurserymaid nor a lady s maid far less a lady s companion or a mantua maker or a straw bonnet maker or a taker in of plain work I won t be anything but a housemaid With regard to my visit to G I have as yet received no invitation but if I should be asked though I should feel it a great act of self denial to refuse yet I have almost made up my mind to do so though the society of the T s is one of the most rousing pleasures I have ever known Good bye my darling E c P S Strike out that word darling it is humbug Where s the use of protestations We ve known each other and liked each other a good while that s enough Not many weeks after this was written Charlotte also became engaged as a governess I intend carefully to abstain from introducing the names of any living people respecting whom I may have to tell unpleasant truths or to quote severe remarks from Miss Bront s letters but it is necessary that the difficulties she had to encounter in her various phases of life should be fairly and frankly made known before the force of what was resisted can be at all understood I was once speaking to her about Agnes Grey the novel in which her sister Anne pretty literally describes her own experience as a governess and alluding more particularly to the account of the stoning of the little nestlings in the presence of the parent birds She said that none but those who had been in the position of a governess could ever realise the dark side of respectable human nature under no great temptation to crime but daily giving way to selfishness and ill temper till its conduct towards those dependent on it sometimes amounts to a tyranny of which one would rather be the victim than the inflicter We can only trust in such cases that the employers err rather from a density of perception and an absence of sympathy than from any natural cruelty of disposition Among several things of the same kind which I well remember she told me what had once occurred to herself She had been entrusted with the care of a little boy three or four years old during the absence of his parents on a day s excursion and particularly enjoined to keep him out of the stable yard His elder brother a lad of eight or nine and not a pupil of Miss Bront s tempted the little fellow into the forbidden place She followed and tried to induce him to come away but instigated by his brother he began throwing stones at her and one of them hit her so severe a blow on the temple that the lads were alarmed into obedience The next day in full family conclave the mother asked Miss Bront what occasioned the mark on her forehead She simply replied An accident ma am and no further inquiry was made but the children both brothers and sisters had been present and honoured her for not telling tales From that time she began to obtain influence over all more or less according to their different characters and as she insensibly gained their affection her own interest in them was increasing But one day at the children s dinner the small truant of the stable yard in a little demonstrative gush said putting his hand in hers I love ou Miss Bront Whereupon the mother exclaimed before all the children Love the governess my dear The family into which she first entered was I believe that of a wealthy Yorkshire manufacturer The following extracts from her correspondence at this time will show how painfully the restraint of her new mode of life pressed upon her The first is from a letter to Emily beginning with one of the tender expressions in which in spite of humbug she indulged herself Mine dear love Mine bonnie love are her terms of address to this beloved sister June th I have striven hard to be pleased with my new situation The country the house and the grounds are as I have said divine but alack a day there is such a thing as seeing all beautiful around you pleasant woods white paths green lawns and blue sunshiny sky and not having a free moment or a free thought left to enjoy them The children are constantly with me As for correcting them I quickly found that was out of the question they are to do as they like A complaint to the mother only brings black looks on myself and unjust partial excuses to screen the children I have tried that plan once and succeeded so notably I shall try no more I said in my last letter that Mrs did not know me I now begin to find she does not intend to know me that she cares nothing about me except to contrive how the greatest possible quantity of labour may be got out of me and to that end she overwhelms me with oceans of needle work yards of cambric to hem muslin nightcaps to make and above all things dolls to dress I do not think she likes me at all because I can t help being shy in such an entirely novel scene surrounded as I have hitherto been by strange and constantly changing faces I used to think I should like to be in the stir of grand folks society but I have had enough of it it is dreary work to look on and listen I see more clearly than I have ever done before that a private governess has no existence is not considered as a living rational being except as connected with the wearisome duties she has to fulfil One of the pleasantest afternoons I have spent here indeed the only one at all pleasant was when Mr walked out with his children and I had orders to follow a little behind As he strolled on through his fields with his magnificent Newfoundland dog at his side he looked very like what a frank wealthy Conservative gentleman ought to be He spoke freely and unaffectedly to the people he met and though he indulged his children and allowed them to tease himself far too much he would not suffer them grossly to insult others WRITTEN IN PENCIL TO A FRIEND July I cannot procure ink without going into the drawing room where I do not wish to go I should have written to you long since and told you every detail of the utterly new scene into which I have lately been cast had I not been daily expecting a letter from yourself and wondering and lamenting that you did not write for you will remember it was your turn I must not bother you too much with my sorrows of which I fear you have heard an exaggerated account If you were near me perhaps I might be tempted to tell you all to grow egotistical and pour out the long history of a private governess s trials and crosses in her first situation As it is I will only ask you to imagine the miseries of a reserved wretch like me thrown at once into the midst of a large family at a time when they were particularly gay when the house was filled with company all strangers people whose faces I had never seen before In this state I had charge given me of a set of pampered spoilt turbulent children whom I was expected constantly to amuse as well as to instruct I soon found that the constant demand on my stock of animal spirits reduced them to the lowest state of exhaustion at times I felt and I suppose seemed depressed To my astonishment I was taken to task on the subject by Mrs with a sternness of manner and a harshness of language scarcely credible like a fool I cried most bitterly I could not help it my spirits quite failed me at first I thought I had done my best strained every nerve to please her and to be treated in that way merely because I was shy and sometimes melancholy was too bad At first I was for giving all up and going home But after a little reflection I determined to summon what energy I had and to weather the storm I said to myself I have never yet quitted a place without gaining a friend adversity is a good school the poor are born to labour and the dependent to endure I resolved to be patient to command my feelings and to take what came the ordeal I reflected would not last many weeks and I trusted it would do me good I recollected the fable of the willow and the oak I bent quietly and now I trust the storm is blowing over me Mrs is generally considered an agreeable woman so she is I doubt not in general society She behaves somewhat more civilly to me now than she did at first and the children are a little more manageable but she does not know my character and she does not wish to know it I have never had five minutes conversation with her since I came except while she was scolding me I have no wish to be pitied except by yourself if I were talking to you I could tell you much more TO EMILY ABOUT THIS TIME Mine bonnie love I was as glad of your letter as tongue can express it is a real genuine pleasure to hear from home a thing to be saved till bedtime when one has a moment s quiet and rest to enjoy it thoroughly Write whenever you can I could like to be at home I could like to work in a mill I could like to feel some mental liberty I could like this weight of restraint to be taken off But the holidays will come Coraggio Her temporary engagement in this uncongenial family ended in the July of this year not before the constant strain upon her spirits and strength had again affected her health but when this delicacy became apparent in palpitations and shortness of breathing it was treated as affectation as a phase of imaginary indisposition which could be dissipated by a good scolding She had been brought up rather in a school of Spartan endurance than in one of maudlin self indulgence and could bear many a pain and relinquish many a hope in silence After she had been at home about a week her friend proposed that she should accompany her in some little excursion having pleasure alone for its object She caught at the idea most eagerly at first but her hope stood still waned and had almost disappeared before after many delays it was realised In its fulfilment at last it was a favourable specimen of many a similar air bubble dancing before her eyes in her brief career in which stern realities rather than pleasures formed the leading incidents July th Your proposal has almost driven me clean daft if you don t understand that ladylike expression you must ask me what it means when I see you The fact is an excursion with you anywhere whether to Cleathorpe or Canada just by ourselves would be to me most delightful I should indeed like to go but I can t get leave of absence for longer than a week and I m afraid that would not suit you must I then give it up entirely I feel as if I could not I never had such a chance of enjoyment before I do want to see you and talk to you and be with you When do you wish to go Could I meet you at Leeds To take a gig from Haworth to B would be to me a very serious increase of expense and I happen to be very low in cash Oh rich people seem to have many pleasures at their command which we are debarred from However no repining Say when you go and I shall be able in my answer to say decidedly whether I can accompany you or not I must I will I m set upon it I ll be obstinate and bear down all opposition P S Since writing the above I find that aunt and papa have determined to go to Liverpool for a fortnight and take us all with them It is stipulated however that I should give up the Cleathorpe scheme I yield reluctantly I fancy that about this time Mr Bront found it necessary either from failing health or the increased populousness of the parish to engage the assistance of a curate At least it is in a letter written this summer that I find mention of the first of a succession of curates who henceforward revolved round Haworth Parsonage and made an impression on the mind of one of its inmates which she has conveyed pretty distinctly to the world The Haworth curate brought his clerical friends and neighbours about the place and for a time the incursions of these near the parsonage tea time formed occurrences by which the quietness of the life there was varied sometimes pleasantly sometimes disagreeably The little adventure recorded at the end of the following letter is uncommon in the lot of most women and is a testimony in this case to the unusual power of attraction though so plain in feature which Charlotte possessed when she let herself go in the happiness and freedom of home August th The Liverpool journey is yet a matter of talk a sort of castle in the air but between you and me I fancy it is very doubtful whether it will ever assume a more solid shape Aunt like many other elderly people likes to talk of such things but when it comes to putting them into actual execution she rather falls off Such being the case I think you and I had better adhere to our first plan of going somewhere together independently of other people I have got leave to accompany you for a week at the utmost a fortnight but no more Where do you wish to go Burlington I should think from what M says would be as eligible a place as any When do you set off Arrange all these things according to your convenience I shall start no objections The idea of seeing the sea of being near it watching its changes by sunrise sunset moonlight and noon day in calm perhaps in storm fills and satisfies my mind I shall be discontented at nothing And then I am not to be with a set of people with whom I have nothing in common who would be nuisances and bores but with you whom I like and know and who knows me I have an odd circumstance to relate to you prepare for a hearty laugh The other day Mr a vicar came to spend the day with us bringing with him his own curate The latter gentleman by name Mr B is a young Irish clergyman fresh from Dublin University It was the first time we had any of us seen him but however after the manner of his countrymen he soon made himself at home His character quickly appeared in his conversation witty lively ardent clever too but deficient in the dignity and discretion of an Englishman At home you know I talk with ease and am never shy never weighed down and oppressed by that miserable mauvaise honte which torments and constrains me elsewhere So I conversed with this Irishman and laughed at his jests and though I saw faults in his character excused them because of the amusement his originality afforded I cooled a little indeed and drew in towards the latter part of the evening because he began to season his conversation with something of Hibernian flattery which I did not quite relish However they went away and no more was thought about them A few days after I got a letter the direction of which puzzled me it being in a hand I was not accustomed to see Evidently it was neither from you nor Mary my only correspondents Having opened and read it it proved to be a declaration of attachment and proposal of matrimony expressed in the ardent language of the sapient young Irishman I hope you are laughing heartily This is not like one of my adventures is it It more nearly resembles Martha s I am certainly doomed to be an old maid Never mind I made up my mind to that fate ever since I was twelve years old Well thought I I have heard of love at first sight but this beats all I leave you to guess what my answer would be convinced that you will not do me the injustice of guessing wrong On the th of August she still writes from Haworth I have in vain packed my box and prepared everything for our anticipated journey It so happens that I can get no conveyance this week or the next The only gig let out to hire in Haworth is at Harrowgate and likely to remain there for aught I can hear Papa decidedly objects to my going by the coach and walking to B though I am sure I could manage it Aunt exclaims against the weather and the roads and the four winds of heaven so I am in a fix and what is worse so are you On reading over for the second or third time your last letter which by the by was written in such hieroglyphics that at the first hasty perusal I could hardly make out two consecutive words I find you intimate that if I leave this journey till Thursday I shall be too late I grieve that I should have so inconvenienced you but I need not talk of either Friday or Saturday now for I rather imagine there is small chance of my ever going at all The elders of the house have never cordially acquiesced in the measure and now that impediments seem to start up at every step opposition grows more open Papa indeed would willingly indulge me but this very kindness of his makes me doubt whether I ought to draw upon it so though I could battle out aunt s discontent I yield to papa s indulgence He does not say so but I know he would rather I stayed at home and aunt meant well too I dare say but I am provoked that she reserved the expression of her decided disapproval till all was settled between you and myself Reckon on me no more leave me out in your calculations perhaps I ought in the beginning to have had prudence sufficient to shut my eyes against such a prospect of pleasure so as to deny myself the hope of it Be as angry as you please with me for disappointing you I did not intend it and have only one thing more to say if you do not go immediately to the sea will you come to see us at Haworth This invitation is not mine only but papa s and aunt s However a little more patience a little more delay and she enjoyed the pleasure she had wished for so much She and her friend went to Easton for a fortnight in the latter part of September It was here she received her first impressions of the sea Oct th Have you forgotten the sea by this time E Is it grown dim in your mind Or can you still see it dark blue and green and foam white and hear it roaring roughly when the wind is high or rushing softly when it is calm I am as well as need be and very fat I think of Easton very often and of worthy Mr H and his kind hearted helpmate and of our pleasant walks to H Wood and to Boynton our merry evenings our romps with little Hancheon c c If we both live this period of our lives will long be a theme for pleasant recollection Did you chance in your letter to Mr H to mention my spectacles I am sadly inconvenienced by the want of them I can neither read write nor draw with comfort in their absence I hope Madame won t refuse to give them up Excuse the brevity of this letter for I have been drawing all day and my eyes are so tired it is quite a labour to write But as the vivid remembrance of this pleasure died away an accident occurred to make the actual duties of life press somewhat heavily for a time December st We are at present and have been during the last month rather busy as for that space of time we have been without a servant except a little girl to run errands Poor Tabby became so lame that she was at length obliged to leave us She is residing with her sister in a little house of her own which she bought with her savings a year or two since She is very comfortable and wants nothing as she is near we see her very often In the meantime Emily and I are sufficiently busy as you may suppose I manage the ironing and keep the rooms clean Emily does the baking and attends to the kitchen We are such odd animals that we prefer this mode of contrivance to having a new face amongst us Besides we do not despair of Tabby s return and she shall not be supplanted by a stranger in her absence I excited aunt s wrath very much by burning the clothes the first time I attempted to iron but I do better now Human feelings are queer things I am much happier black leading the stoves making the beds and sweeping the floors at home than I should be living like a fine lady anywhere else I must indeed drop my subscription to the Jews because I have no money to keep it up I ought to have announced this intention to you before but I quite forgot I was a subscriber I intend to force myself to take another situation when I can get one though I hate and abhor the very thoughts of governess ship But I must do it and therefore I heartily wish I could hear of a family where they need such a commodity as a governess literally adv He translated
