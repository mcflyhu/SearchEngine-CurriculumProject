In the morning the woman was up with the first light And as the men came grumbling in to breakfast the round face wore its placid smile They joked her and ate hastily and departed for the open field It was part of a steady policy to be always in the open busy hard working men who could not afford to lose an hour The excursion had been a quick restless revolt against weeks of weeding and planting and digging But they had had their lesson They were not likely to stir from their strip of market garden on the plain not till the time was up As the woman went about her work she listened and stopped and went to the door for some sound from upstairs Presently she went up and opened the door and looked in The child lay with one hand thrown above her head a drawn look in the softly arched brow and half parted lips The woman bent over her listening and placed her hand on the small wrist and counted waiting The eyes flashed open and looked at her I thought you were Nono said the child A wistful look filled her face and her lip quivered a little out of it and steadied itself You are Mrs Seabury she said quietly Yes said the woman cheerfully Time to get up dearie She turned away and busied herself with the clothes hanging from their hooks The child s eyes followed her dully I don t think I care to get up she said at last The woman brought the clothes and placed them by the bed and smiled down at her There s something nice to day she said casually We re going outdoors to day Can I said the child She flashed a smile and sat up Can I go out of doors It was a little cry of waiting and the woman s hand dashed across her eyes at the keenness of it Then she smiled the round assuring smile and held up the clothes You hurry up and dress and eat your breakfast she said a good big breakfast and we are going out in the sun you and me She nodded cheerfully and went out The child put one foot over the edge of the bed and looked down at it a little wistfully and placed the other beside it They were very dark little feet a queer brown colour and the legs above them were the same curious brown and the small straight back as she stepped from the bed and slipped off her nightgown and bent above the clothes on the chair The colour ran up to her throat around it and over the whole sunny face and hands and arms a strange eclipsing brown disguise There had been a quick sharp plan to take her abroad and they prepared her hastily against risks on board the steamer The plan had been abandoned as too dangerous But the colour clung to the soft skin and the hair cropped close to the neck had a stubby uncouth look No one seeking Betty Harris would have looked twice at the queer little brownie like creature dressing itself with careful haste It lifted a plaid dress from the chair large squares of red and green plaid and looked at it with raised brows and dropped it over the cropped head The skirt came to the top of the rough shoes on the small feet Betty Harris looked down at the skirt and smoothed it a little and dropped on her knees beside the bed the red and green plaids sweeping around her and said the little prayer that Miss Stone had taught her to say at home grumbling adj She s always grumbling to me about how badly she s treated at work We didn t hear any grumbling about the food placid adj He had been leading a placid life for the past eight years You should be in a placid mood and have a heart to heart talk with her drawn v adj All the characters in the story are drawn from life Her gaze was drawn irresistibly to the scene outside bent n adj He was fully bent upon the project We bent over backward to help them casually adv She remarked casually that she was changing her job I casually mentioned that I might be interested in working abroad uncouth adj She may embarrass you with her uncouth behavior His nephew is an uncouth young man dressing n Don t spend such a lot of time in dressing yourself The children enjoy dressing up in mother s old clothes sweeping adj The citizens voted for sweeping reforms Can you hear the wind sweeping through the branches
