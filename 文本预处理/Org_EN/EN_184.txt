It was as if a gate which had hitherto been closed against him in the Pollard house were now opened They no longer held back from Terry but admitted him freely to their counsels But the first person to whom he spoke was Slim Dugan There was a certain nervousness about Slim this evening and a certain shame For he felt that in the morning to an extent he had backed down from the quarrel with young Black Jack The killing of Larrimer now made that reticence of the morning even more pointed than it had been before With all these things taken into consideration Slim Dugan was in the mood to fight and die for he felt that his honor was concerned A single slighting remark to Terry a single sneering side glance would have been a signal for gunplay And everyone knew it The moment there was silence the son of Black Jack went straight to Slim Dugan Slim he said just loud enough for everyone to hear a fellow isn t himself before noon I ve been thinking over that little trouble we had this morning and I ve made up my mind that if there were any fault it was mine for taking a joke too seriously At any rate if it s agreeable to you Slim I d like to shake hands and call everything square But if there s going to be any ill will let s have it out right now Slim Dugan wrung the hand of Terry without hesitation If you put it that way he said cordially I don t mind saying that I was damned wrong to heave that stone at the hoss And I apologize Terry And so everything was forgotten Indeed where there had been enmity before there was now friendship And there was a breath of relief drawn by every member of the gang The peacemaking tendency of Hollis had more effect on the others than a dozen killings They already granted that he was formidable They now saw that he was highly desirable also Dinner that night was a friendly affair except that Kate stayed in her room with a headache Johnny the Chinaman smuggled a tray to her Oregon Charlie went to the heart of matters with one of his rare speeches You hear me talk Hollis She s mad because you ve stepped off She ll get over it all right Oregon Charlie had a right to talk It was an open secret that he had loved Kate faithfully ever since he joined the gang But apparently Terry Hollis cared little about the moods of the girl He was the center of festivities that evening until an interruption from the outside formed a diversion It came in the form of a hard rider the mutter of his hoofs swept to the door and Phil Marvin having examined the stranger from the shuttered loophole beside the entrance opened the door to him at once It s Sandy he fired over his shoulder in explanation A weary looking fellow came into the room swinging his hat to knock the dust off it and loosening the bandanna at his throat The drooping pale mustache explained his name Two words were spoken and no more News said Pollard News grunted Sandy and took a place at the table Terry had noted before that there were always one or two extra places laid he had always liked the suggestion of hospitality but he was rather in doubt about this guest He ate with marvellous expedition keeping his lean face close to the table and bolting his food like a hungry dog Presently he drained his coffee cup arranged his mustache with painful care and seemed prepared to talk First thing he said now and utter silence spread around the table as he began to talk first thing is that McGuire is coming I seen him on the trail cut to the left and took the short way He ought to be loping in almost any minute Terry saw the others looking straight at Pollard the leader was thoughtful for a moment Is he coming with a gang Sandy Nope alone He was always a nervy cuss Someday He left the sentence unfinished Denver had risen noiselessly I m going to beat it for my bunk he announced Let me know when the sheriff is gone Sit where you are Denver McGuire ain t going to lay hands on you Sure he ain t agreed Denver But I ain t partial to having guys lay eyes on me neither Some of you can go out and beat up trouble I like to stay put And he glided out of the room with no more noise than a sliding shadow He had hardly disappeared when a heavy hand beat at the door That s McGuire announced Pollard Let him in Phil So saying he twitched his gun out of the holster spun the cylinder and dropped it back Don t try nothing till you see me put my hand into my beard boys He don t mean much so long as he s come alone Marvin drew back the door Terry saw a man with shoulders of martial squareness enter And there was a touch of the military in his brisk step and the curt nod he sent at Marvin as he passed the latter He had not taken off his sombrero It cast a heavy shadow across the upper part of his worn sad face Evening sheriff came from Pollard and a muttered chorus from the others repeated the greeting The sheriff cast his glance over them like a schoolteacher about to deliver a lecture Evening boys Sit down McGuire I m only staying a minute I ll talk standing It was a declaration of war I guess this is the first time I been up here Pollard The very first sheriff Well if I been kind of neglectful it ain t that I m not interested in you all a heap He brought it out with a faint smile there was no response to that mirth Matter of fact I been keeping my eye on you fellows right along Now I ain t up here to do no accusing I m up here to talk to you man to man They s been a good many queer things happen None of em in my county mind you or I might have done some talking to you before now But they s been a lot of queer things happen right around in the mountains and some of em has traced back kind of close to Joe Pollard s house as a starting point I ain t going to go any further If I m wrong they ain t any harm done if I m right you know what I mean But I tell you this boys we re a long sufferin lot around these parts but they s some things that we don t stand for and one of em that riles us particular much is when a gent that lays out to be a regular hardworking rancher even if he ain t got much of a ranch to talk about and work about takes mankillers under their wings It ain t regular and it ain t popular around these parts I guess you know what I mean Terry expected Pollard to jump to his feet But there was no such response The other men stared down at the table their lips working Pollard alone met the eye of the sheriff The sheriff changed the direction of his glance Instantly it fell on Terry and stayed there You re the man I mean you re Terry Hollis Black Jack s son Terry imitated the others and did not reply Oh they ain t any use beating about the bush You got Black Jack s blood in you That s plain I remember your old man well enough Terry rose slowly from his chair I think I m not disputing that sheriff As a matter of fact I m very proud of my father I think you are said the sheriff gravely I think you are damned proud of him So proud you might even figure on imitating what he done in the old days Perhaps said Terry The imp of the perverse was up in him now urging him on Step soft sheriff cried Pollard suddenly as though he sensed a crisis of which the others were unaware Terry keep hold on yourself The sheriff waved the cautionary advice away My nerves are tolerable good Pollard he said coldly The kid ain t scaring me none And now hark to me Black Jack You ve got away with two gents already two that s known I mean Minter was one and Larrimer was two Both times it was a square break But I know your kind like a book You re going to step over the line pretty damn pronto and when you do I m going to get you friend as sure as the sky is blue You ain t going to do what your dad done before you I ll tell you why In the old days the law was a joke But it s tolerable strong now You hear me talk get out of these here parts and stay out We don t want none of your kind There was a flinching of the men about the table They had seen the tigerish suddenness with which Terry s temper could flare they had received an object lesson that morning But to their amazement he remained perfectly cool under fire He sauntered a little closer to the sheriff I ll tell you McGuire he said gently Your great mistake is in talking too much You ve had a good deal of success my friend So much that your head is turned You re quite confident that no one will invade your special territory and you keep your sympathy for neighboring counties You pity the sheriffs around you Now listen to me You ve branded me as a criminal in advance And I m not going to disappoint you I m going to try to live up to your high hopes And what I do will be done right in your county my friend I m going to make the sheriffs pity you McGuire I m going to make your life a small bit of hell I m going to keep you busy And now get out And before you judge the next man that crosses your path wait for the advice of twelve good men and true You need advice McGuire You need it to beat hell Start on your way His calmness was shaken a little toward the end of this speech and his voice at the close rang sharply at McGuire The latter considered him from beneath frowning brows for a moment and then without another word without a glance to the others and a syllable of adieu turned and walked slowly thoughtfully out of the room Terry walked back to his place As he sat down he noticed that every eye was upon him worried I m sorry that I ve had to do so much talking he said And I particularly apologize to you Pollard But I m tired of being hounded As a matter of fact I m now going to try to play the part of the hound myself Action
