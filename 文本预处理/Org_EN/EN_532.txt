The fine three topmast schooner Ariel on a cruise around the world had already been out a year from San Francisco when Jerry boarded her As a world and as a white god world she was to him beyond compare She was not small like the Arangi nor was she cluttered fore and aft on deck and below with a spawn of niggers The only black Jerry found on her was Johnny while her spaciousness was filled principally with two legged white gods He met them everywhere at the wheel on lookout washing decks polishing brass work running aloft or tailing on to sheets and tackles half a dozen at a time But there was a difference There were gods and gods and Jerry was not long in learning that in the hierarchy of the heaven of these white gods on the Ariel the sailorizing ship working ones were far beneath the captain and his two white and gold clad officers These in turn were less than Harley Kennan and Villa Kennan for them it came quickly to him Harley Kennan commanded Nevertheless there was one thing he did not learn and was destined never to learn namely the supreme god over all on the Ariel Although he never tried to know being unable to think to such a distance he never came to know whether it was Harley Kennan who commanded Villa or Villa Kennan who commanded Harley In a way without vexing himself with the problem he accepted their over lordship of the world as dual Neither out ranked the other They seemed to rule co equal while all others bowed before them It is not true that to feed a dog is to win a dog s heart Never did Harley or Villa feed Jerry yet it was to them he elected to belong them he elected to love and serve rather than to the Japanese steward who regularly fed him For that matter Jerry like any dog was able to differentiate between the mere direct food giver and the food source That is subconsciously he was aware that not alone his own food but the food of all on board found its source in the man and woman They it was who fed all and ruled all Captain Winters might give orders to the sailors but Captain Winters took orders from Harley Kennan Jerry knew this as indubitably as he acted upon it although all the while it never entered his head as an item of conscious knowledge And as he had been accustomed all his life as with Mister Haggin Skipper and even with Bashti and the chief devil devil doctor of Somo he attached himself to the high gods themselves and from the gods under them received deference accordingly As Skipper on the Arangi and Bashti in Somo had promulgated taboos so the man and the woman on the Ariel protected Jerry with taboos From Sano the Japanese steward and from him alone did Jerry receive food Not from any sailor in whaleboat or launch could he accept or would he be offered a bit of biscuit or an invitation to go ashore for a run Nor did they offer it Nor were they permitted to become intimate to the extent of romping and playing with him nor even of whistling to him along the deck By nature a one man dog all this was very acceptable to Jerry Differences of degree there were of course but no one more delicately and definitely knew those differences than did Jerry himself Thus it was permissible for the two officers to greet him with a Hello or a Good morning and even to touch a hand in a brief and friendly pat to his head With Captain Winters however greater familiarity obtained Captain Winters could rub his ears shake hands with his scratch his back and even roughly catch him by the jowls But Captain Winters invariably surrendered him up when the one man and the one woman appeared on deck When it came to liberties delicious wanton liberties Jerry alone of all on board could take them with the man and woman and on the other hand they were the only two to whom he permitted liberties Any indignity that Villa Kennan chose to inflict upon him he was throbbingly glad to receive such as doubling his ears inside out till they stuck at the same time making him sit upright with helpless forefeet paddling the air for equilibrium while she blew roguishly in his face and nostrils As bad was Harley Kennan s trick of catching him gloriously asleep on an edge of Villa s skirt and of tickling the hair between his toes and making him kick involuntarily in his sleep until he kicked himself awake to hearing of gurgles and snickers of laughter at his expense In turn at night on deck wriggling her toes at him under a rug to simulate some strange and crawling creature of an invader he would dare to simulate his own befoolment and quite disrupt Villa s bed with his frantic ferocious attack on the thing that he knew was only her toes In gales of laughter intermingled with half genuine cries of alarm as almost his teeth caught her toes she always concluded by gathering him into her arms and laughing the last of her laughter away into his flattened ears of joy and love Who else of all on board the Ariel would have dared such devilishness with the lady god s bed This question it never entered his mind to ask himself yet he was fully aware of how exclusively favoured he was Another of his deliberate tricks was one discovered by accident Thrusting his muzzle to meet her in love he chanced to encounter her face with his soft hard little nose with such force as to make her recoil and cry out When another time in all innocence this happened again he became conscious of it and of its effect upon her and thereafter when she grew too wildly wild too wantonly facetious in her teasing playful love of him he would thrust his muzzle at her face and make her throw her head back to escape him After a time learning that if he persisted she would settle the situation by gathering him into her arms and gurgling into his ears he made it a point to act his part until such delectable surrender and joyful culmination were achieved Never by accident in this deliberate game did he hurt her chin or cheek so severely as he hurt his own tender nose but in the hurt itself he found more of delight than pain All of fun it was all through and in addition it was love fun Such hurt was more than fun Such pain was heart pleasure All dogs are god worshippers More fortunate than most dogs Jerry won to a pair of gods that no matter how much they commanded loved more Although his nose might threaten grievously to hurt the cheek of his adored god rather than have it really hurt he would have spilled out all the love tide of his heart that constituted the life of him He did not live for food for shelter for a comfortable place between the darknesses that rounded existence He lived for love And as surely as he gladly lived for love would he have died gladly for love Not quickly in Somo had Jerry s memory of Skipper and Mister Haggin faded Life in the cannibal village had been too unsatisfying There had been too little love Only love can erase the memory of love or rather the hurt of lost love And on board the Ariel such erasement occurred quickly Jerry did not forget Skipper and Mister Haggin But at the moments he remembered them the yearning that accompanied the memory grew less pronounced and painful The intervals between the moments widened nor did Skipper and Mister Haggin take form and reality so frequently in his dreams for after the manner of dogs he dreamed much and vividly schooner n The schooner was driven ashore The current was bearing coracle and schooner
