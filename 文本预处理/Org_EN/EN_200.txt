My mother said this was the New Consecration He is the stuff of the d vot she said In another age he would have been a great ascetic or a saint I was thankful the temptations in these directions were slight for people of our time I liked better to think of him in one of his boyish moods helping us to re stock our aquarium Hermione Helmstone s inclination to mock behind his back to imitate little stiffnesses and what she called his Scotticisms even Lady Barbara s unblushing Schw rmerei was less a trial to me than the talk about saints and ascetics The Helmstone girls fell into the bad habit of dropping in to share our tea and our visitor Hermione pretended that she came solely to keep Barbara in countenance But Hermione on these occasions did most of the talking She didn t care what she said How long she demanded are you going to stay a heart thumping question which none of us had ventured to put [Pg ] Three weeks A beggarly little while she said exchanging looks with her confederate Then her malicious sympathy at his having to spend so much of his life in sick rooms and hospitals looking at horrors He said somewhat shortly that he spent most of his life nowadays thank God in a laboratory Which was scarcely polite Ouf Hermione sniffed I know Place full of bottles and bad smells He smiled at that and took it up with spirit No room in your house so clean he said And no place anywhere half so interesting A laboratory was full of mystery yes and of romance oh naturally not her kind What did he know about her kind Hermione demanded Perhaps he knew more than we suspected For just as though he guessed that Hermione s name for him was Scotch Granite and that she lamented Barbara s always falling in love with such unromantic people he scoffed at Hermione s conception of romance An ideal worthy of the servants hall A marble terrace by moonlight [Pg ] No Well then the supper room at the Carlton Paris frocks diamonds a band banging away and a thousand pound motor car waiting to whirl the happy pair away to bliss of the most expensive brand They went on to quarrel about novels Hermione hated the gloomy kind For Eric s benefit she added And the scientific kind Exactly It was for her sort of taste that ample provision was made in the feuilleton of a certain paper Hermione was not a bit dashed You may look for romance in bottles if you like For my part she stuck out her chin Well oblige the company by telling us what you look for in a story Orange blossoms says she promptly not little bits of brain He laughed with the rest of us at that and he knocked the ash out of his pipe against the arm of the garden chair Lord Helmstone he said would be waiting for his foursome A day or two after Hermione accused him to his face of story telling [Pg ] You said you were only going to stay three weeks To our astonishment he answered I don t think I said only three weeks I said three weeks Three weeks certainly and all the while arranging to settle down and live here I looked from Eric slightly annoyed to Hermione mocking and to Lady Barbara rolling large pale eyes and smiling self consciously What makes you think I m going to settle down he demanded Well isn t that the intention of most people who put up a cottage in the country Oh you mean my penny bungalow He picked up his golf clubs Nobody in this country settles down in a bungalow he said As though she had some private understanding of the matter Lady Barbara seemed to speak for him just to live in for a while she said quite gently Not to live in at all Eric threw the strap of the canvas golf bag over his shoulder and made for the front door What do you want a bungalow for then [Pg ] Hermione s teasing voice followed after him mere harmless eccentricity He was like that he said He turned round at Hermione s laugh and I saw him looking at the expression on Lady Barbara s face Very gentle and happy almost pretty And I had never thought Lady Barbara the least pretty before Eric too seemed to be struck I find I ve got to have a place to put things he said more seriously and then he went on out Must have some place to keep one s traps he called back Lady Barbara stood leaning against the door and looking out at the retreating figure still with that expression that made the plain face almost beautiful I felt that Eric had come lamely out of the encounter What did it all mean For he had said nothing whatever to us who thought ourselves his special friends about this curious project of putting up a bungalow A hideous little ready made house with a roof of corrugated iron painted arsenic green it came down from London in sections and was set up in a field adjoining Big Klaus s orchard [Pg ] The field belonged to Lord Helmstone Eric continued to eat and to sleep at Big Klaus s but he used to go over to the Bungalow and shut himself up to work As the days went on and he showed no sign of increased intimacy with the Helmstones I clutched at the idea that perhaps he had found he couldn t work very well in the midst of farmyard noises He had spoken of the melancholy moo ing of cows waiting for meadow bars to be let down of the baa ing and grunting and the eternal barking that went on And those noises which he was strangely still more sensitive to produced by Big Klaus s cocks and hens underneath Eric s window and by the ducks and geese hissing and clacking on the pond between the house and the stables I was not likely to forget how he had mocked at country quiet or the samples he gave us of the academic calm that reigned at Big Klaus s I think I never heard my mother laugh so much as on that first day he did the peaceful country life for us Eric rather out of temper presenting his grievance with great spirit wretched man sits up addling his brains till two in the morning At four this kind of[Pg ] thing In a quiet meditative way he would begin clucking Then quacking almost sleepily at first then with more and more fervour till he would leave the ducks and soar away on the ecstasy of a loud exuberant crow All this not the least in the sketchy impressionist way that most people who try will imitate those humble noises but with a precision and vigour that first startled you and then made you feel that you were being given not only an absolutely faithful reproduction of the sound those creatures make but in the oddest way given their point of view as well We laughed the more I think because the comedy seemed to come out of the revelation of the immense seriousness of the animals Eric s commentary seemed so fair It seemed to admit that the importance to ducks and cocks and hens of their goings on was at least as great as the importance of peace and quiet to him With an air of doing it against the grain he gave you with a rueful kind of honesty the duck s sentiments in a series of depressed little quacks that hardly needed the translation Been all over this repulsive pond turned myself and all my family upside down for hours Nothing Then[Pg ] indignant quacks and Silly new servant can t tell time Past five o clock and no sharps Then a single jubilant Quack There she is and a rising chorus till anyone not in the room would be ready to swear we kept as many ducks as Big Klaus A moment s silence and in his own person Eric would say with a sigh Now perhaps I can tackle that German review Buck Buck Buck or rather a series of sounds that defies the alphabet Then the interruption My wife s laid an egg and the shrill rapture of a loud crow of great authority The Bungalow was out of earshot of all that We heard orders were given that no letters or telegrams were ever to be taken to the Bungalow When Eric was there no matter what happened nobody was to disturb him And when he wasn t there the Bungalow was shut and locked I think I have said that Hermione was the most daring girl imaginable She went one day Well doesn t the field belong to us and looked in at first one window and then another She said there was nothing[Pg ] but a stove and packing cases in the room she could see into And she brought back a bewildering account of what had been done to the windows of the other room There were no curtains and no blinds but thick brown paper had been pasted over the glass of each lower sash You could no more see in than you could see through the wall The top sashes were down and Hermione naturally thought he must be there So she called Mr Annan quite loud But he wasn t there after all she said Of course the next time she met him on the links she began to tease him about papering up his windows And how can you see Oh quite well thank you Well anyhow I don t believe you read all the time Nobody could read the whole day and half the night No he didn t read all the time What do you do then Ah there was no telling And that was true There was no getting Eric to tell you anything he didn t want to Hermione announced that she had been to call Yes he said I heard you call [Pg ] She stared You don t mean to say you were in there all the time Yes I was there he said going on with his putting practice quite at his ease Hermione was speechless for a moment and that was the only time in my life I ever saw Hermione blush What a monster you were not to come out when you heard me Sorry but I was too busy he said I always am busy when I m at the Bungalow She was still rather red but laughing too I suppose then you heard me try the door She hadn t told us she had gone as far as that Yes I heard you try the door Well you are an extraordinary being shutting yourself up with brown paper pasted over the windows only the lower half and none at all over the skylight Sitting there behind brown paper with the door locked He laughed You see how necessary my precautions are [Pg ] I believe you do something in there you re ashamed of Well I m not very proud of what I do Not yet She clutched Barbara s arm Babs she said in a loud whisper he makes bombs Sh not so loud please Eric looked solemnly across the links to where Eddie Monmouth was giving Bettina her first lesson in hitting off No it isn t bombs Hermione said after a moment You make counterfeit money If ever I make any money Eric agreed it will have to be counterfeit One day with Lady Barbara following anxious in her wake Hermione came flying in to tell us she was hot on the trace of Eric Annan s secret He was one of those horrible vivisectionists The Bungalow was a torture chamber She had gone to the station to meet someone and there on the platform addressed E Annan Esq was a crate full of creatures poor little darling guinea pigs [Pg ] She taxed him with the guinea pigs the moment he appeared No wonder you paste thick brown paper over your windows What do you do with all those poor darling guinea pigs He answered by asking her what she did with all her Chow dogs I think he probably knew that Hermione bred these dogs They took prizes at shows and Hermione did a thriving trade in selling Chows to her friends for sums that seemed to us extortionate She bought jewellery with some of the proceeds the rest she put in the bank But there was truth as well as evasion in the answer she gave Eric You know perfectly well the Chows are pets Exactly and what a wasted youth yours must have been if you never heard of keeping guinea pigs Keeping them I used to have them to play with but you know quite well you don t mean to keep them Not for ever Very clever of you if you kept yours for ever Of course she hadn t been able to keep them[Pg ] beyond their natural span But I never did anything horrible to them Then Lady Barbara whose long upper lip seemed to have grown longer under the tension behaved a little treacherously to her sister In her anxiety to excuse whatever Eric might do or have done Barbara told in her halting way some family anecdotes about Hermione s teasing pets that had to be rescued from her clutches and about certain birds and kittens and a monkey which had one and all succumbed Hermione tried to make light of these damaging revelations I was only a child But Lady Barbara gave her no quarter It was only a year ago Babs said that Hermione had a horse killed under her in Scotland You were warned too You just rode him to death And you know nobody gives the dogs such whippings as you do Hermione ignored the horse To do her justice she hated to be reminded of that But she defended whipping the dogs If they weren t whipped now and then they d get out of hand Why should they be in hand Eric asked For your pleasure And profit Not[Pg ] theirs He spoke of the severity of training that broke in house dogs and I had my first glimpse of the difficulty of that point in ethics the relation of human beings to domestic animals Hermione was goaded into harking back to the guinea pigs Where was he going to keep them In hutches or in enclosures in the field Hermione s eyes sparkled She was glad she had counted them she said I shall just notice how long you keep them Oh when I ve trained them of course I shall dispose of them Hermione looked at him a moment and then with her most beguiling air she begged him not to tease her any more What do you really want them for Well he said I ll tell you I am trying an experiment I expect after all to make my fortune Lady Barbara brightened at that Eric went on briskly You know how fast guinea pigs breed and how close and clean they crop grass Well here is a great natural industry waiting to be exploited My guinea pigs are going to give an ocular demonstration to my farmer friends My[Pg ] idea is if I breed guinea pigs and let them out in squads at so much a day But if you let them out said Lady Barbara innocently won t they run away Ours did While Hermione was laughing Eric promised to supply movable enclosures with his Guinea Pig Squads When they ve eaten one area clean simply move the hurdles on You ll see There ll soon be a corner in guinea pigs and a slump in lawn mowers consecration n
