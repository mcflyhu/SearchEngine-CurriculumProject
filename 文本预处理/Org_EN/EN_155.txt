Twenty four years made the face of Vance Cornish a little better fed a little more blocky of cheek but he remained astonishingly young At forty nine the lumpish promise of his youth was quite gone He was in a trim and solid middle age His hair was thinned above the forehead but it gave him more dignity On the whole he left an impression of a man who has done things and who will do more before he is through He shifted his feet from the top of the porch railing and shrugged himself deeper into his chair It was marvelous how comfortable Vance could make himself He had one great power the ability to sit still through any given interval Now he let his eye drift quietly over the Cornish ranch It lay entirely within one grasp of the vision spilling across the valley from Sleep Mountain on the lower bosom of which the house stood to Mount Discovery on the north Not that the glance of Vance Cornish lurched across this bold distance His gaze wandered as slowly as a free buzzes across a clover field not knowing on which blossom to settle Below him generously looped Bear Creek tumbled out of the southeast and roved between noble borders of silver spruce into the shadows of the Blue Mountains of the north half a dozen miles across and ten long of grazing and farm land rich loamy bottom land scattered with aspens Beyond covering the gentle roll of the foothills was grazing land Scattering lodgepole pine began in the hills and thickened into dense yellow green thickets on the upper mountain slopes And so north and north the eye of Vance Cornish wandered and climbed until it rested on the bald summit of Mount Discovery It had its name out of its character standing boldly to the south out of the jumble of the Blue Mountains It was a solid unit this Cornish ranch fenced away with mountains watered by a river pleasantly forested and obviously predestined for the ownership of one man Vance Cornish on the porch of the house felt like an enthroned king overlooking his dominions As a matter of fact his holdings were hardly more than nominal In the beginning his father had left the ranch equally to Vance and Elizabeth thickly plastered with debts The son would have sold the place for what they could clear He went East to hunt for education and pleasure his sister remained and fought the great battle by herself She consecrated herself to the work which implied that the work was sacred And to her indeed it was She was twenty two and her brother twelve when their father died Had she been a tithe younger and her brother a mature man it would have been different As it was she felt herself placed in a maternal position with Vance She sent him away to school rolled up her sleeves and started to order chaos In place of husband children love and the fruits of love she accepted the ranch The dam between the rapids and the waterfall was the child of her brain the plowed fields of the central part of the valley were her reward In ten years of constant struggle she cleared away the debts And then since Vance gave her nothing but bills to pay she began to buy out his interest He chose to learn his business lessons on Wall Street Elizabeth paid the bills but she checked the sums against his interest in the ranch And so it went on Vance would come out to the ranch at intervals and show a brief feverish interest plan a new set of irrigation canals or a sawmill or a better road out over the Blue Mountains But he dropped such work half done and went away Elizabeth said nothing She kept on paying his bills and she kept on cutting down his interest in the old Cornish ranch until at the present time he had only a finger tip hold Root and branch the valley and all that was in it belonged to Elizabeth Cornish She was proud of her possession though she seldom talked of her pride Nevertheless Vance knew and smiled It was amusing because after all what she had done and all her work would revert to him at her death Until that time why should he care in whose name the ranch remained so long as his bills were paid He had not worked but in recompense he had remained young Elizabeth had labored all her youth away At forty nine he was ready to begin the most important part of his career At sixty his sister was a withered old ghost of a woman He fell into a pleasant reverie When Elizabeth died he would set in some tennis courts beside the house buy some blooded horses cut the road wide and deep to let the world come up Bear Creek Valley and retire to the life of a country gentleman His sister s voice cut into his musing She had two tones One might be called her social register It was smooth gentle the low pitched and controlled voice of a gentlewoman The other voice was hard and sharp It could drive hard and cold across a desk and bring businessmen to an understanding that here was a mind not a woman At present she used her latter tone Vance Cornish came into a shivering consciousness that she was sitting beside him He turned his head slowly It was always a shock to come out of one of his pleasant dreams and see that worn hollow eyed impatient face Are you forty nine Vance I m not fifty at least he countered She remained imperturbable looking him over He had come to notice that in the past half dozen years his best smiles often failed to mellow her expression He felt that something disagreeable was coming Why did Cornwall run away this morning I hoped to take him on a trip He had business to do His diversion had been a distinct failure and had been turned against him For she went on Which leads to what I have to say You re going back to New York in a few days I suppose No my dear I haven t been across the water for two years Paris Brussels A little less grace a little more spirit Which means money A few thousand only I ll be back by fall Do you know that you ll have to mortgage your future for that money Vance He blinked at her but maintained his smile under fire courageously Come come Things are booming You told me yesterday what you d clean up on the last bunch of Herefords When she folded her hands she was most dangerous he knew And now the bony fingers linked and she shrugged the shawl more closely around her shoulders We re partners aren t we smiled Vance Partners yes You have one share and I have a thousand But you don t want to sell out your final claim I suppose His smile froze Eh If you want to get those few thousands Vance you have nothing to put up for them except your last shreds of property That s why I say you ll have to mortgage your future for money from now on But how does it all come about I ve warned you I ve been warning you for twenty five years Vance Once again he attempted to turn her He always had the impression that if he became serious deadly serious for ten consecutive minutes with his sister he would be ruined He kept on with his semi jovial tone There are two arts Elizabeth One is making money and the other is spending it You ve mastered one and I ve mastered the other Which balances things don t you think She did not melt he waved down to the farm land Watch that wave of wind Elizabeth A gust struck the scattering of aspens and turned up the silver of the dark green leaves The breeze rolled across the trees in a long rippling flash of light But Elizabeth did not look down Her glance was fixed on the changeless snow of Mount Discovery s summit As long as you have something to spend spending is a very important art Vance But when the purse is empty it s a bit useless it seems to me Well then I ll have to mortgage my future As a matter of fact I suppose I could borrow what I want on my prospects A veritable Indian yell instantly taken up and prolonged by a chorus of similar shouts cut off the last of his words Round the corner of the house shot a blood bay stallion red as the red of iron under the blacksmith s hammer with a long black tail snapping and flaunting behind him his ears flattened his beautiful vicious head outstretched in an effort to tug the reins out of the hands of the rider Failing in that effort he leaped into the air like a steeplechaser and pitched down upon stiffened forelegs The shock rippled through the body of the rider and came to his head with a snap that jerked his chin down against his breast The stallion rocked back on his hind legs whirled and then flung himself deliberately on his back A sufficiently cunning maneuver first stunning the enemy with a blow and then crushing him before his senses returned But he landed on nothing save hard gravel The rider had whipped out of the saddle and stood poised strong as the trunk of a silver spruce The fighting horse a little shaken by the impact of his fall nevertheless whirled with catlike agility to his feet a beautiful thing to watch As he brought his forequarters off the earth he lunged at the rider with open mouth A sidestep that would have done credit to a pugilist sent the youngster swerving past that danger He leaped to the saddle at the same time that the blood bay came to his four feet The chorus in full cry was around the horse four or five excited cow punchers waving their sombreros and yelling for horse or rider according to the gallantry of the fight The bay was in the air more than he was on the ground eleven or twelve hundred pounds of might writhing snapping bolting halting sunfishing with devilish cunning dropping out of the air on one stiff foreleg with an accompanying sway to one side that gave the rider the effect of a cudgel blow at the back of the head and then a whip snap to part the vertebrae Whirling on his hind legs and again flinging himself desperately on the ground only to fail come to his feet with the clinging burden once more maddeningly in place and go again through a maze of fence rowing and sun fishing until suddenly he straightened out and bolted down the slope like a runaway locomotive on a downgrade A terrifying spectacle but the rider sat erect with one arm raised high above his head in triumph and his yell trailing off behind him From a running gait the stallion fell into a smooth pace a true wild pacer his hoofs beating the ground with the force and speed of pistons and hurling himself forward with incredible strides Horse and rider lurched out of sight among the silver spruce By the Lord wonderful cried Vance Cornish He heard a stifled cry beside him a cry of infinite pain Is is it over And there sat Elizabeth the Indomitable with her face buried in her hands like a girl of sixteen Of course it s over said Vance wondering profoundly She seemed to dread to look up And Terence He s all right Ever hear of a horse that could get that young wildcat out of the saddle He clings as if he had claws But where did he get that red devil Terence ran him down in the mountains somewhere she answered speaking as one who had only half heard the question Two months of constant trailing to do it I think But oh you re right The horse is a devil And sometimes I think She stopped shuddering Vance had returned to the ranch only the day before after a long absence More and more after he had been away he found it difficult to get in touch with things on the ranch Once he had been
