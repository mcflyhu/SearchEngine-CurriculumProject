For the reason just stated the little girls were sent home in the autumn of when Charlotte was little more than nine years old About this time an elderly woman of the village came to live as servant at the parsonage She remained there as a member of the household for thirty years and from the length of her faithful service and the attachment and respect which she inspired is deserving of mention Tabby was a thorough specimen of a Yorkshire woman of her class in dialect in appearance and in character She abounded in strong practical sense and shrewdness Her words were far from flattery but she would spare no deeds in the cause of those whom she kindly regarded She ruled the children pretty sharply and yet never grudged a little extra trouble to provide them with such small treats as came within her power In return she claimed to be looked upon as a humble friend and many years later Miss Bront told me that she found it somewhat difficult to manage as Tabby expected to be informed of all the family concerns and yet had grown so deaf that what was repeated to her became known to whoever might be in or about the house To obviate this publication of what it might be desirable to keep secret Miss Bront used to take her out for a walk on the solitary moors where when both were seated on a tuft of heather in some high lonely place she could acquaint the old woman at leisure with all that she wanted to hear Tabby had lived in Haworth in the days when the pack horses went through once a week with their tinkling bells and gay worsted adornment carrying the produce of the country from Keighley over the hills to Colne and Burnley What is more she had known the bottom or valley in those primitive days when the fairies frequented the margin of the beck on moonlight nights and had known folk who had seen them But that was when there were no mills in the valleys and when all the wool spinning was done by hand in the farm houses round It wur the factories as had driven em away she said No doubt she had many a tale to tell of by gone days of the country side old ways of living former inhabitants decayed gentry who had melted away and whose places knew them no more family tragedies and dark superstitious dooms and in telling these things without the least consciousness that there might ever be anything requiring to be softened down would give at full length the bare and simple details Miss Branwell instructed the children at regular hours in all she could teach making her bed chamber into their schoolroom Their father was in the habit of relating to them any public news in which he felt an interest and from the opinions of his strong and independent mind they would gather much food for thought but I do not know whether he gave them any direct instruction Charlotte s deep thoughtful spirit appears to have felt almost painfully the tender responsibility which rested upon her with reference to her remaining sisters She was only eighteen months older than Emily but Emily and Anne were simply companions and playmates while Charlotte was motherly friend and guardian to both and this loving assumption of duties beyond her years made her feel considerably older than she really was Patrick Branwell their only brother was a boy of remarkable promise and in some ways of extraordinary precocity of talent Mr Bront s friends advised him to send his son to school but remembering both the strength of will of his own youth and his mode of employing it he believed that Patrick was better at home and that he himself could teach him well as he had taught others before So Patrick or as his family called him Branwell remained at Haworth working hard for some hours a day with his father but when the time of the latter was taken up with his parochial duties the boy was thrown into chance companionship with the lads of the village for youth will to youth and boys will to boys Still he was associated in many of his sisters plays and amusements These were mostly of a sedentary and intellectual nature I have had a curious packet confided to me containing an immense amount of manuscript in an inconceivably small space tales dramas poems romances written principally by Charlotte in a hand which it is almost impossible to decipher without the aid of a magnifying glass No description will give so good an idea of the extreme minuteness of the writing as the annexed facsimile of a page Among these papers there is a list of her works which I copy as a curious proof how early the rage for literary composition had seized upon her CATALOGUE OF

Evening Walk a Poem June rd Making in the whole twenty two volumes C BRONT August As each volume contains from sixty to a hundred pages and the size of the page lithographed is rather less than the average the amount of the whole seems very great if we remember that it was all written in about fifteen months So much for the quantity the quality strikes me as of singular merit for a girl of thirteen or fourteen Both as a specimen of her prose style at this time and also as revealing something of the quiet domestic life led by these children I take an extract from the introduction to Tales of the Islanders the title of one of their Little Magazines June the st The play of the Islanders was formed in December in the following manner One night about the time when the cold sleet and stormy fogs of November are succeeded by the snow storms and high piercing night winds of confirmed winter we were all sitting round the warm blazing kitchen fire having just concluded a quarrel with Tabby concerning the propriety of lighting a candle from which she came off victorious no candle having been produced A long pause succeeded which was at last broken by Branwell saying in a lazy manner I don t know what to do This was echoed by Emily and Anne Tabby Wha ya may go t bed Branwell I d rather do anything than that Charlotte Why are you so glum to night Tabby Oh suppose we had each an island of our own Branwell If we had I would choose the Island of Man Charlotte And I would choose the Isle of Wight Emily The Isle of Arran for me Anne And mine shall be Guernsey We then chose who should be chief men in our islands Branwell chose John Bull Astley Cooper and Leigh Hunt Emily Walter Scott Mr Lockhart Johnny Lockhart Anne Michael Sadler Lord Bentinck Sir Henry Halford I chose the Duke of Wellington and two sons Christopher North and Co and Mr Abernethy Here our conversation was interrupted by the to us dismal sound of the clock striking seven and we were summoned off to bed The next day we added many others to our list of men till we got almost all the chief men of the kingdom After this for a long time nothing worth noticing occurred In June we erected a school on a fictitious island which was to contain children The manner of the building was as follows The Island was fifty miles in circumference and certainly appeared more like the work of enchantment than anything real c Two or three things strike me much in this fragment one is the graphic vividness with which the time of the year the hour of the evening the feeling of cold and darkness outside the sound of the night winds sweeping over the desolate snow covered moors coming nearer and nearer and at last shaking the very door of the room where they were sitting for it opened out directly on that bleak wide expanse is contrasted with the glow and busy brightness of the cheerful kitchen where these remarkable children are grouped Tabby moves about in her quaint country dress frugal peremptory prone to find fault pretty sharply yet allowing no one else to blame her children we may feel sure Another noticeable fact is the intelligent partisanship with which they choose their great men who are almost all stanch Tories of the time Moreover they do not confine themselves to local heroes their range of choice has been widened by hearing much of what is not usually considered to interest children Little Anne aged scarcely eight picks out the politicians of the day for her chief men There is another scrap of paper in this all but illegible handwriting written about this time and which gives some idea of the sources of their opinions THE HISTORY OF THE YEAR Once Papa lent my sister Maria a book It was an old geography book she wrote on its blank leaf Papa lent me this book This book is a hundred and twenty years old it is at this moment lying before me While I write this I am in the kitchen of the Parsonage Haworth Tabby the servant is washing up the breakfast things and Anne my youngest sister Maria was my eldest is kneeling on a chair looking at some cakes which Tabby has been baking for us Emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet Papa and Branwell are gone to Keighley Aunt is upstairs in her room and I am sitting by the table writing this in the kitchen Keighley is a small town four miles from here Papa and Branwell are gone for the newspaper the Leeds Intelligencer a most excellent Tory newspaper edited by Mr Wood and the proprietor Mr Henneman We take two and see three newspapers a week We take the Leeds Intelligencer Tory and the Leeds Mercury Whig edited by Mr Baines and his brother son in law and his two sons Edward and Talbot We see the John Bull it is a high Tory very violent Mr Driver lends us it as likewise Blackwood s Magazine the most able periodical there is The Editor is Mr Christopher North an old man seventy four years of age the st of April is his birth day his company are Timothy Tickler Morgan O Doherty Macrabin Mordecai Mullion Warnell and James Hogg a man of most extraordinary genius a Scottish shepherd Our plays were established Young Men June Our Fellows July Islanders December These are our three great plays that are not kept secret Emily s and my best plays were established the st of December the others March Best plays mean secret plays they are very nice ones All our plays are very strange ones Their nature I need not write on paper for I think I shall always remember them The Young Men s play took its rise from some wooden soldiers Branwell had Our Fellows from sop s Fables and the Islanders from several events which happened I will sketch out the origin of our plays more explicitly if I can First Young Men Papa bought Branwell some wooden soldiers at Leeds when Papa came home it was night and we were in bed so next morning Branwell came to our door with a box of soldiers Emily and I jumped out of bed and I snatched up one and exclaimed This is the Duke of Wellington This shall be the Duke When I had said this Emily likewise took up one and said it should be hers when Anne came down she said one should be hers Mine was the prettiest of the whole and the tallest and the most perfect in every part Emily s was a grave looking fellow and we called him Gravey Anne s was a queer little thing much like herself and we called him Waiting Boy Branwell chose his and called him Buonaparte The foregoing extract shows something of the kind of reading in which the little Bront s were interested but their desire for knowledge must have been excited in many directions for I find a list of painters whose works I wish to see drawn up by Charlotte when she was scarcely thirteen Guido Reni Julio Romano Titian Raphael Michael Angelo Correggio Annibal Caracci Leonardo da Vinci Fra Bartolomeo Carlo Cignani Vandyke Rubens Bartolomeo Ramerghi Here is this little girl in a remote Yorkshire parsonage who has probably never seen anything worthy the name of a painting in her life studying the names and characteristics of the great old Italian and Flemish masters whose works she longs to see some time in the dim future that lies before her There is a paper remaining which contains minute studies of and criticisms upon the engravings in Friendship s Offering for showing how she had early formed those habits of close observation and patient analysis of cause and effect which served so well in after life as handmaids to her genius The way in which Mr Bront made his children sympathise with him in his great interest in politics must have done much to lift them above the chances of their minds being limited or tainted by petty local gossip I take the only other remaining personal fragment out of Tales of the Islanders it is a sort of apology contained in the introduction to the second volume for their not having been continued before the writers had been for a long time too busy and latterly too much absorbed in politics Parliament was opened and the great Catholic question was brought forward and the Duke s measures were disclosed and all was slander violence party spirit and confusion Oh those six months from the time of the King s speech to the end Nobody could write think or speak on any subject but the Catholic question and the Duke of Wellington and Mr Peel I remember the day when the Intelligence Extraordinary came with Mr Peel s speech in it containing the terms on which the Catholics were to be let in With what eagerness Papa tore off the cover and how we all gathered round him and with what breathless anxiety we listened as one by one they were disclosed and explained and argued upon so ably and so well and then when it was all out how aunt said that she thought it was excellent and that the Catholics could do no harm with such good security I remember also the doubts as to whether it would pass the House of Lords and the prophecies that it would not and when the paper came which was to decide the question the anxiety was almost dreadful with which we listened to the whole affair the opening of the doors the hush the royal dukes in their robes and the great duke in green sash and waistcoat the rising of all the peeresses when he rose the reading of his speech Papa saying that his words were like precious gold and lastly the majority of one to four sic in favour of the Bill But this is a digression c c This must have been written when she was between thirteen and fourteen It will be interesting to some of my readers to know what was the character of her purely imaginative writing at this period While her description of any real occurrence is as we have seen homely graphic and forcible when she gives way to her powers of creation her fancy and her language alike run riot sometimes to the very borders of apparent delirium Of this wild weird writing a single example will suffice It is a letter to the editor of one of the Little Magazines Sir It is well known that the Genii have declared that unless they perform certain arduous duties every year of a mysterious nature all the worlds in the firmament will be burnt up and gathered together in one mighty globe which will roll in solitary grandeur through the vast wilderness of space inhabited only by the four high princes of the Genii till time shall be succeeded by Eternity and the impudence of this is only to be paralleled by another of their assertions namely that by their magic might they can reduce the world to a desert the purest waters to streams of livid poison and the clearest lakes to stagnant waters the pestilential vapours of which shall slay all living creatures except the blood thirsty beast of the forest and the ravenous bird of the rock But that in the midst of this desolation the palace of the Chief Genii shall rise sparkling in the wilderness and the horrible howl of their war cry shall spread over the land at morning at noontide and night but that they shall have their annual feast over the bones of the dead and shall yearly rejoice with the joy of victors I think sir that the horrible wickedness of this needs no remark and therefore I haste to subscribe myself c July It is not unlikely that the foregoing letter may have had some allegorical or political reference invisible to our eyes but very clear to the bright little minds for whom it was intended Politics were evidently their grand interest the Duke of Wellington their demi god All that related to him belonged to the heroic age Did Charlotte want a knight errant or a devoted lover the Marquis of Douro or Lord Charles Wellesley came ready to her hand There is hardly one of her prose writings at this time in which they are not the principal personages and in which their august father does not appear as a sort of Jupiter Tonans or Deus ex Machin As one evidence how Wellesley haunted her imagination I copy out a few of the titles to her papers in the various magazines Liffey Castle a Tale by Lord C Wellesley Lines to the River Aragua by the Marquis of Douro An Extraordinary Dream by Lord C Wellesley The Green Dwarf a Tale of the Perfect Tense by the Lord Charles Albert Florian Wellesley Strange Events by Lord C A F Wellesley Life in an isolated village or a lonely country house presents many little occurrences which sink into the mind of childhood there to be brooded over No other event may have happened or be likely to happen for days to push one of these aside before it has assumed a vague and mysterious importance Thus children leading a secluded life are often thoughtful and dreamy the impressions made upon them by the world without the unusual sights of earth and sky the accidental meetings with strange faces and figures rare occurrences in those out of the way places are sometimes magnified by them into things so deeply significant as to be almost supernatural This peculiarity I perceive very strongly in Charlotte s writings at this time Indeed under the circumstances it is no peculiarity It has been common to all from the Chaldean shepherds the lonely herdsman stretched on the soft grass through half a summer s day the solitary monk to all whose impressions from without have had time to grow and vivify in the imagination till they have been received as actual personifications or supernatural visions to doubt which would be blasphemy To counterbalance this tendency in Charlotte was the strong common sense natural to her and daily called into exercise by the requirements of her practical life Her duties were not merely to learn her lessons to read a certain quantity to gain certain ideas she had besides to brush rooms to run errands up and down stairs to help in the simpler forms of cooking to be by turns play fellow and monitress to her younger sisters and brother to make and to mend and to study economy under her careful aunt Thus we see that while her imagination received vivid impressions her excellent understanding had full power to rectify them before her fancies became realities On a scrap of paper she has written down the following relation June o clock p m Haworth near Bradford The following strange occurrence happened on the nd of June At the time Papa was very ill confined to his bed and so weak that he could not rise without assistance Tabby and I were alone in the kitchen about half past nine ante meridian Suddenly we heard a knock at the door Tabby rose and opened it An old man appeared standing without who accosted her thus Old Man Does the parson live here Tabby Yes Old Man I wish to see him Tabby He is poorly in bed Old Man I have a message for him Tabby Who from Old Man From the Lord Tabby Who Old Man The Lord He desires me to say that the Bridegroom is coming and that we must prepare to meet him that the cords are about to be loosed and the golden bowl broken the pitcher broken at the fountain Here he concluded his discourse and abruptly went his way As Tabby closed the door I asked her if she knew him Her reply was that she had never seen him before nor any one like him Though I am fully persuaded that he was some fanatical enthusiast well meaning perhaps but utterly ignorant of true piety yet I could not forbear weeping at his words spoken so unexpectedly at that particular period Though the date of the following poem is a little uncertain it may be most convenient to introduce it here It must have been written before but how much earlier there are no means of determining I give it as a specimen of the remarkable poetical talent shown in the various diminutive writings of this time at least in all of them which I have been able to read THE WOUNDED STAG Passing amid the deepest shade Of the wood s sombre heart Last night I saw a wounded deer Laid lonely and apart Such light as pierced the crowded boughs Light scattered scant and dim Passed through the fern that formed his couch And centred full on him Pain trembled in his weary limbs Pain filled his patient eye Pain crushed amid the shadowy
