Awake You dreamers wake Frona was out of her sleeping furs at Del Bishop s first call but ere she had slipped a skirt on and bare feet into moccasins her father beyond the blanket curtain had thrown back the flaps of the tent and stumbled out The river was up In the chill gray light she could see the ice rubbing softly against the very crest of the bank it even topped it in places and the huge cakes worked inshore many feet A hundred yards out the white field merged into the dim dawn and the gray sky Subdued splits and splutters whispered from out the obscureness and a gentle grinding could be heard When will it go she asked of Del Not a bit too lively for us See there He pointed with his toe to the water lapping out from under the ice and creeping greedily towards them A foot rise every ten minutes Danger he scoffed Not on your life It s got to go Them islands waving his hand indefinitely down river can t hold up under more pressure If they don t let go the ice the ice ll scour them clean out of the bed of the Yukon Sure But I ve got to be chasin back Lower ground down our way Fifteen inches on the cabin floor and McPherson and Corliss hustlin perishables into the bunks Tell McPherson to be ready for a call Jacob Welse shouted after him And then to Frona Now s the time for St Vincent to cross the back channel The baron shivering barefooted pulled out his watch Ten minutes to three he chattered Hadn t you better go back and get your moccasins Frona asked There will be time And miss the magnificence Hark From nowhere in particular a brisk crackling arose then died away The ice was in motion Slowly very slowly it proceeded down stream There was no commotion no ear splitting thunder no splendid display of force simply a silent flood of white an orderly procession of tight packed ice packed so closely that not a drop of water was in evidence It was there somewhere down underneath but it had to be taken on faith There was a dull hum or muffled grating but so low in pitch that the ear strained to catch it Ah Where is the magnificence It is a fake The baron shook his fists angrily at the river and Jacob Welse s thick brows seemed to draw down in order to hide the grim smile in his eyes Ha ha I laugh I snap my fingers See I defy As the challenge left his lips Baron Courbertin stepped upon a cake which rubbed lightly past at his feet So unexpected was it that when Jacob Welse reached after him he was gone The ice was picking up in momentum and the hum growing louder and more threatening Balancing gracefully like a circus rider the Frenchman whirled away along the rim of the bank Fifty precarious feet he rode his mount becoming more unstable every instant and he leaped neatly to the shore He came back laughing and received for his pains two or three of the choicest phrases Jacob Welse could select from the essentially masculine portion of his vocabulary And for why Courbertin demanded stung to the quick For why Jacob Welse mimicked wrathfully pointing into the sleek stream sliding by A great cake had driven its nose into the bed of the river thirty feet below and was struggling to up end All the frigid flood behind crinkled and bent back like so much paper Then the stalled cake turned completely over and thrust its muddy nose skyward But the squeeze caught it while cake mounted cake at its back and its fifty feet of muck and gouge were hurled into the air It crashed upon the moving mass beneath and flying fragments landed at the feet of those that watched Caught broadside in a chaos of pressures it crumbled into scattered pieces and disappeared God The baron spoke the word reverently and with awe Frona caught his hand on the one side and her father s on the other The ice was now leaping past in feverish haste Somewhere below a heavy cake butted into the bank and the ground swayed under their feet Another followed it nearer the surface and as they sprang back upreared mightily and with a ton or so of soil on its broad back bowled insolently onward And yet another reaching inshore like a huge hand ripped three careless pines out by the roots and bore them away Day had broken and the driving white gorged the Yukon from shore to shore What of the pressure of pent water behind the speed of the flood had become dizzying Down all its length the bank was being gashed and gouged and the island was jarring and shaking to its foundations Oh great Great Frona sprang up and down between the men Where is your fake baron Ah He shook his head Ah I was wrong I am miserable But the magnificence Look He pointed down to the bunch of islands which obstructed the bend There the mile wide stream divided and subdivided again which was well for water but not so well for packed ice The islands drove their wedged heads into the frozen flood and tossed the cakes high into the air But cake pressed upon cake and shelved out of the water out and up sliding and grinding and climbing and still more cakes from behind till hillocks and mountains of ice upreared and crashed among the trees A likely place for a jam Jacob Welse said Get the glasses Frona He gazed through them long and steadily It s growing spreading out A cake at the right time and the right place But the river is falling Frona cried The ice had dropped six feet below the top of the bank and the Baron Courbertin marked it with a stick Our man s still there but he doesn t move It was clear day and the sun was breaking forth in the north east They took turn about with the glasses in gazing across the river Look Is it not marvellous Courbertin pointed to the mark he had made The water had dropped another foot Ah Too bad too bad The jam there will be none Jacob Welse regarded him gravely Ah There will be he asked picking up hope Frona looked inquiringly at her father Jams are not always nice he said with a short laugh It all depends where they take place and where you happen to be But the river Look It falls I can see it before my eyes It is not too late He swept the island studded bend and saw the ice mountains larger and reaching out one to the other Go into the tent Courbertin and put on the pair of moccasins you ll find by the stove Go on You won t miss anything And you Frona start the fire and get the coffee under way Half an hour after though the river had fallen twenty feet they found the ice still pounding along Now the fun begins Here take a squint you hot headed Gaul The left hand channel man Now she takes it Courbertin saw the left hand channel close and then a great white barrier heave up and travel from island to island The ice before them slowed down and came to rest Then followed the instant rise of the river Up it came in a swift rush as though nothing short of the sky could stop it As when they were first awakened the cakes rubbed and slid inshore over the crest of the bank the muddy water creeping in advance and marking the way Mon Dieu But this is not nice But magnificent baron Frona teased In the meanwhile you are getting your feet wet He retreated out of the water and in time for a small avalanche of cakes rattled down upon the place he had just left The rising water had forced the ice up till it stood breast high above the island like a wall But it will go down soon when the jam breaks See even now it comes up not so swift It has broken Frona was watching the barrier No it hasn t she denied But the water no longer rises like a race horse Nor does it stop rising He was puzzled for the nonce Then his face brightened Ah I have it Above somewhere there is another jam Most excellent is it not She caught his excited hand in hers and detained him But listen Suppose the upper jam breaks and the lower jam holds He looked at her steadily till he grasped the full import His face flushed and with a quick intake of the breath he straightened up and threw back his head He made a sweeping gesture as though to include the island Then you and I the tent the boats cabins trees everything and La Bijou Pouf and all are gone to the devil Frona shook her head It is too bad Bad Pardon Magnificent No no baron not that But that you are not an Anglo Saxon The race could well be proud of you And you Frona would you not glorify the French At it again eh Throwing bouquets at yourselves Del Bishop grinned at them and made to depart as quickly as he had come But twist yourselves Some sick men in a cabin down here Got to get em out You re needed And don t be all day about it he shouted over his shoulder as he disappeared among the trees The river was still rising though more slowly and as soon as they left the high ground they were splashing along ankle deep in the water Winding in and out among the trees they came upon a boat which had been hauled out the previous fall And three chechaquos who had managed to get into the country thus far over the ice had piled themselves into it also their tent sleds and dogs But the boat was perilously near the ice gorge which growled and wrestled and over topped it a bare dozen feet away Come Get out of this you fools Jacob Welse shouted as he went past Del Bishop had told them to get the hell out of there when he ran by and they could not understand One of them turned up an unheeding terrified face Another lay prone and listless across the thwarts as though bereft of strength while the third with the face of a clerk rocked back and forth and moaned monotonously My God My God The baron stopped long enough to shake him Damn he cried Your legs man not God but your legs Ah ah hump yourself Yes hump Get a move on Twist Get back from the bank The woods the trees anywhere He tried to drag him out but the man struck at him savagely and held back How one collects the vernacular he confided proudly to Frona as they hurried on Twist It is a strong word and suitable You should travel with Del she laughed He d increase your stock in no time You don t say so Yes but I do Ah Your idioms I shall never learn And he shook his head despairingly with both his hands They came out in a clearing where a cabin stood close to the river On its flat earth roof two sick men swathed in blankets were lying while Bishop Corliss and Jacob Welse were splashing about inside the cabin after the clothes bags and general outfit The mean depth of the flood was a couple of feet but the floor of the cabin had been dug out for purposes of warmth and there the water was to the waist Keep the tobacco dry one of the sick men said feebly from the roof Tobacco hell his companion advised Look out for the flour And the sugar he added as an afterthought That s cause Bill he don t smoke miss the first man explained But keep an eye on it won t you he pleaded Here Now shut up Del tossed the canister beside him and the man clutched it as though it were a sack of nuggets Can I be of any use she asked looking up at them Nope Scurvy Nothing ll do em any good but God s country and raw potatoes The pocket miner regarded her for a moment What are you doing here anyway Go on back to high ground But with a groan and a crash the ice wall bulged in A fifty ton cake ended over splashing them with muddy water and settled down before the door A smaller cake drove against the out jutting corner logs and the cabin reeled Courbertin and Jacob Welse were inside After you Frona heard the baron and then her father s short amused laugh and the gallant Frenchman came out last squeezing his way between the cake and the logs Say Bill if that there lower jam holds we re goners the man with the canister called to his partner Ay that it will came the answer Below Nulato I saw Bixbie Island swept clean as my old mother s kitchen floor The men came hastily together about Frona This won t do We ve got to carry them over to your shack Corliss As he spoke Jacob Welse clambered nimbly up the cabin and gazed down at the big barrier Where s McPherson he asked Petrified astride the ridge pole this last hour Jacob Welse waved his arm It s breaking There she goes No kitchen floor this time Bill with my respects to your old woman called he of the tobacco Ay answered the imperturbable Bill The whole river seemed to pick itself up and start down the stream With the increasing motion the ice wall broke in a hundred places and from up and down the shore came the rending and crashing of uprooted trees Corliss and Bishop laid hold of Bill and started off to McPherson s and Jacob Welse and the baron were just sliding his mate over the eaves when a huge block of ice rammed in and smote the cabin squarely Frona saw it and cried a warning but the tiered logs were overthrown like a house of cards She saw Courbertin and the sick man hurled clear of the wreckage and her father go down with it She sprang to the spot but he did not rise She pulled at him to get his mouth above water but at full stretch his head barely showed Then she let go and felt about with her hands till she found his right arm jammed between the logs These she could not move but she thrust between them one of the roof poles which had underlaid the dirt and moss It was a rude handspike and hardly equal to the work for when she threw her weight upon the free end it bent and crackled Heedful of the warning she came in a couple of feet and swung upon it tentatively and carefully till something gave and Jacob Welse shoved his muddy face into the air He drew half a dozen great breaths and burst out But that tastes good And then throwing a quick glance about him Frona Del Bishop is a most veracious man Why she asked perplexedly Because he said you d do you know He kissed her and they both spat the mud from their lips laughing Courbertin floundered round a corner of the wreckage Never was there such a man he cried gleefully He is mad crazy There is no appeasement His skull is cracked by the fall and his tobacco is gone It is chiefly the tobacco which is lamentable But his skull was not cracked for it was merely a slit of the scalp of five inches or so You ll have to wait till the others come back I can t carry Jacob Welse pointed to his right arm which hung dead Only wrenched he explained No bones broken The baron struck an extravagant attitude and pointed down at Frona s foot Ah the water it is gone and there a jewel of the flood a pearl of price Her well worn moccasins had gone rotten from the soaking and a little white toe peeped out at the world of slime Then I am indeed wealthy baron for I have nine others And who shall deny who shall deny he cried fervently What a ridiculous foolish lovable fellow it is I kiss your hand And he knelt gallantly in the muck She jerked her hand away and burying it with its mate in his curly mop shook his head back and forth What shall I do with him father Jacob Welse shrugged his shoulders and laughed and she turned Courbertin s face up and kissed him on the lips And Jacob Welse knew that his was the larger share in that manifest joy The river fallen to its winter level was pounding its ice glut steadily along But in falling it had rimmed the shore with a twenty foot wall of stranded floes The great blocks were spilled inland among the thrown and standing trees and the slime coated flowers and grasses like the titanic vomit of some Northland monster The sun was not idle and the steaming thaw washed the mud and foulness from the bergs till they blazed like heaped diamonds in the brightness or shimmered opalescent blue Yet they were reared hazardously one on another and ever and anon flashing towers and rainbow minarets crumbled thunderously into the flood By one of the gaps so made lay La Bijou and about it saving chechaquos and sick men were grouped the denizens of Split up Na na lad twa men ll be a plenty Tommy McPherson sought about him with his eyes for corroboration Gin ye gat three i the canoe twill be ower comfortable It must be a dash or nothing Corliss spoke up We need three men Tommy and you know it Na na twa s a plenty I m tellin ye But I m afraid we ll

there s ithers a plenty wi oot coontin me No there s not Courbertin doesn t know the first thing St Vincent evidently cannot cross the slough Mr Welse s arm puts him out of it So it s only you and I Tommy I ll not be inqueesitive but yon son of Anak s a likely mon He maun pit oop a guid stroke While the Scot did not lose much love for the truculent pocket miner he was well aware of his grit and seized the chance to save himself by shoving the other into the breach Del Bishop stepped into the centre of the little circle paused and looked every man in the eyes before he spoke Is there a man here ll say I m a coward he demanded without preface Again he looked each one in the eyes Or is there a man who ll even hint that I ever did a curlike act And yet again he searched the circle Well and good I hate the water but I ve never been afraid of it I don t know how to swim yet I ve been over the side more times than it s good to remember I can t pull an oar without batting my back on the bottom of the boat As for steering well authorities say there s thirty two points to the compass but there s at least thirty more when I get started And as sure as God made little apples I don t know my elbow from my knee about a paddle I ve capsized damn near every canoe I ever set foot in I ve gone right through the bottom of two I ve turned turtle in the Canyon and been pulled out below the White Horse I can only keep stroke with one man and that man s yours truly But gentlemen if the call comes I ll take my place in La Bijou and take her to hell if she don t turn over on the way Baron Courbertin threw his arms about him crying As sure as God made little apples thou art a man Tommy s face was white and he sought refuge in speech from the silence which settled down I ll deny I lift a guid paddle nor that my wind is fair but gin ye gang a tithe the way the next jam ll be on us For my pairt I conseeder it ay rash Bide a wee till the river s clear say I It s no go Tommy Jacob Welse admonished You can t cash excuses here But mon It doesna need discreemeenation That ll do from Corliss You re coming I ll naething o the sort I ll Shut up Del had come into the world with lungs of leather and larynx of brass and when he thus jerked out the stops the Scotsman quailed and shrank down Oyez Oyez In contrast to Del s siren tones Frona s were purest silver as they rippled down island through the trees Oyez Oyez Open water Open water And wait a minute I ll be with you Three miles up stream where the Yukon curved grandly in from the west a bit of water appeared It seemed too marvellous for belief after the granite winter but McPherson untouched of imagination began a crafty retreat Bide a wee bide a wee he protested when collared by the pocket miner A ve forgot my pipe Then you ll bide with us Tommy Del sneered And I d let you have a draw of mine if your own wasn t sticking out of your pocket Twas the baccy I d in mind Then dig into this He shoved his pouch into McPherson s shaking hands You d better shed your coat Here I ll help you And private Tommy if you don t act the man I won t do a thing to you Sure Corliss had stripped his heavy flannel shirt for freedom and it was plain when Frona joined them that she also had been shedding Jacket and skirt were gone and her underskirt of dark cloth ceased midway below the knee You ll do Del commended Jacob Welse looked at her anxiously and went over to where she was testing the grips of the several paddles You re not he began She nodded You re a guid girl McPherson broke in Now a ve a wumman to home to say naething o three bairns All ready Corliss lifted the bow of La Bijou and looked back The turbid water lashed by on the heels of the ice run Courbertin took the stern in the steep descent and Del marshalled Tommy s reluctant rear A flat floe dipping into the water at a slight incline served as the embarking stage Into the bow with you Tommy The Scotsman groaned felt Bishop breathe heavily at his back and obeyed Frona meeting his weight by slipping into the stern I can steer she assured Corliss who for the first time was aware that she was coming He glanced up to Jacob Welse as though for consent and received it Hit er up Hit er up Del urged impatiently You re burnin daylight bishop n He was a bishop who was held in reverence by all Two years after his death the bishop was canonised
