At seven in the morning when Skipper rolled him out of the blanket and got up Jerry celebrated the new day by chasing the wild dog back into his hole and by drawing a snicker from the blacks on deck when with a growl and a flash of teeth he made Lerumie side step half a dozen feet and yield the deck to him He shared breakfast with Skipper who instead of eating washed down with a cup of coffee fifty grains of quinine wrapped in a cigarette paper and who complained to the mate that he would have to get under the blankets and sweat out the fever that was attacking him Despite his chill and despite his teeth that were already beginning to chatter while the burning sun extracted the moisture in curling mist wreaths from the deck planking Van Horn cuddled Jerry in his arms and called him princeling and prince and a king and a son of kings For Van Horn had often listened to the recitals of Jerry s pedigree by Tom Haggin over Scotch and sodas when it was too pestilentially hot to go to bed And the pedigree was as royal blooded as was possible for an Irish terrier to possess whose breed beginning with the ancient Irish wolf hound had been moulded and established by man in less than two generations of men There was Terrence the Magnificent descended as Van Horn remembered from the American bred Milton Droleen out of the Queen of County Antrim Breda Muddler which royal bitch as every one who is familiar with the stud book knows goes back as far as the almost mythical Spuds with along the way no primrose dallyings with black and tan Killeney Boys and Welsh nondescripts And did not Biddy trace to Erin mother and star of the breed through a long descendant out of Breda Mixer herself an ancestress of Breda Muddler Nor could be omitted from the purple record the later ancestress Moya Doolen So Jerry knew the ecstasy of loving and of being loved in the arms of his love god although little he knew of such phrases as king s son and son of kings save that they connoted love for him in the same way that Lerumie s hissing noises connoted hate One thing Jerry knew without knowing that he knew namely that in the few hours he had been with Skipper he loved him more than he had loved Derby and Bob who with the exception of Mister Haggin were the only other white gods he had ever known He was not conscious of this He merely loved merely acted on the prompting of his heart or head or whatever organic or anatomical part of him that developed the mysterious delicious and insatiable hunger called love Skipper went below He went all unheeding of Jerry who padded softly at his heels until the companionway was reached Skipper was unheeding of Jerry because of the fever that wrenched his flesh and chilled his bones that made his head seem to swell monstrously that glazed the world to his swimming eyes and made him walk feebly and totteringly like a drunken man or a man very aged And Jerry sensed that something was wrong with Skipper Skipper beginning the babblings of delirium which alternated with silent moments of control in order to get below and under blankets descended the ladder like stairs and Jerry all yearning controlled himself in silence and watched the slow descent with the hope that when Skipper reached the bottom he would raise his arms and lift him down But Skipper was too far gone to remember that Jerry existed He staggered with wide spread arms to keep from falling along the cabin floor for ard to the bunk in the tiny stateroom Jerry was truly of a kingly line He wanted to call out and beg to be taken down But he did not He controlled himself he knew not why save that he was possessed by a nebulous awareness that Skipper must be considered as a god should be considered and that this was no time to obtrude himself on Skipper His heart was torn with desire although he made no sound and he continued only to yearn over the companion combing and to listen to the faint sounds of Skipper s progress for ard But even kings and their descendants have their limitations and at the end of a quarter of an hour Jerry was ripe to cease from his silence With the going below of Skipper evidently in great trouble the light had gone out of the day for Jerry He might have stalked the wild dog but no inducement lay there Lerumie passed by unnoticed although he knew he could bully him and make him give deck space The myriad scents of the land entered his keen nostrils but he made no note of them Not even the flopping bellying mainsail overhead as the Arangi rolled becalmed could draw a glance of quizzical regard from him Just as it was tremblingly imperative that Jerry must suddenly squat down point his nose at the zenith and vocalize his heart rending woe an idea came to him There is no explaining how this idea came No more can it be explained than can a human explain why at luncheon to day he selects green peas and rejects string beans when only yesterday he elected to choose string beans and to reject green peas No more can it be explained than can a human judge sentencing a convicted criminal and imposing eight years imprisonment instead of the five or nine years that also at the same time floated upward in his brain explain why he categorically determined on eight years as the just adequate punishment Since not even humans who are almost half gods can fathom the mystery of the genesis of ideas and the dictates of choice appearing in their consciousness as ideas it is not to be expected of a more dog to know the why of the ideas that animate it to definite acts toward definite ends And so Jerry Just as he must immediately howl he was aware that the idea an entirely different idea was there in the innermost centre of the quick thinkingness of him with all its compulsion He obeyed the idea as a marionette obeys the strings and started forthwith down the deck aft in quest of the mate He had an appeal to make to Borckman Borckman was also a two legged white god Easily could Borckman lift him down the precipitous ladder which was to him unaided a taboo the violation of which was pregnant with disaster But Borckman had in him little of the heart of love which is understanding Also Borckman was busy Besides overseeing the continuous adjustment by trimming of sails and orders to the helmsman of the Arangi to her way on the sea and overseeing the boat s crew at its task of washing deck and polishing brasswork he was engaged in steadily nipping from a stolen bottle of his captain s whiskey which he had stowed away in the hollow between the two sacks of yams lashed on deck aft the mizzenmast Borckman was on his way for another nip after having thickly threatened to knock seven bells and the ten commandments out of the black at the wheel for faulty steering when Jerry appeared before him and blocked the way to his desire But Jerry did not block him as he would have blocked Lerumie for instance There was no showing of teeth no bristling of neck hair Instead Jerry was all placation and appeal all softness of pleading in a body denied speech that nevertheless was articulate from wagging tail and wriggling sides to flat laid ears and eyes that almost spoke to any human sensitive of understanding But Borckman saw in his way only a four legged creature of the brute world which in his arrogant brutalness he esteemed more brute than himself All the pretty picture of the soft puppy instinct with communicativeness bursting with tenderness of petition was veiled to his vision What he saw was merely a four legged animal to be thrust aside while he continued his lordly two legged progress toward the bottle that could set maggots crawling in his brain and make him dream dreams that he was prince not peasant that he was a master of matter rather than a slave of matter And thrust aside Jerry was by a rough and naked foot as harsh and unfeeling in its impact as an inanimate breaking sea on a beach jut of insensate rock He half sprawled on the slippery deck regained his balance and stood still and looked at the white god who had treated him so cavalierly The meanness and unfairness had brought from Jerry no snarling threat of retaliation such as he would have offered Lerumie or any other black Nor in his brain was any thought of retaliation This was no Lerumie This was a superior god two legged white skinned like Skipper like Mister Haggin and the couple of other superior gods he had known Only did he know hurt such as any child knows under the blow of a thoughtless or unloving mother In the hurt was mingled a resentment He was keenly aware that there were two sorts of roughness There was the kindly roughness of love such as when Skipper gripped him by the jowl shook him till his teeth rattled and thrust him away with an unmistakable invitation to come back and be so shaken again Such roughness to Jerry was heaven In it was the intimacy of contact with a beloved god who in such manner elected to express a reciprocal love But this roughness of Borckman was different It was the other kind of roughness in which resided no warm affection no heart touch of love Jerry did not quite understand but he sensed the difference and resented without expressing in action the wrongness and unfairness of it So he stood after regaining balance and soberly regarded in a vain effort to understand the mate with a bottle bottom inverted skyward the mouth to his lips the while his throat made gulping contractions and noises And soberly he continued to regard the mate when he went aft and threatened to knock the Song of Songs and the rest of the Old Testament out of the black helmsman whose smile of teeth was as humbly gentle and placating as Jerry s had been when he made his appeal Leaving this god as a god unliked and not understood Jerry sadly trotted back to the companionway and yearned his head over the combing in the direction in which he had seen Skipper disappear What bit at his consciousness and was a painful incitement in it was his desire to be with Skipper who was not right and who was in trouble He wanted Skipper He wanted to be with him first and sharply because he loved him and second and dimly because he might serve him And wanting Skipper in his helplessness and youngness in experience of the world he whimpered and cried his heart out across the companion combing and was too clean and direct in his sorrow to be deflected by an outburst of anger against the niggers on deck and below who chuckled at him and derided him From the crest of the combing to the cabin floor was seven feet He had only a few hours before climbed the precipitous stairway but it was impossible and he knew it to descend the stairway And yet at the last he dared it So compulsive was the prod of his heart to gain to Skipper at any cost so clear was his comprehension that he could not climb down the ladder head first with no grippingness of legs and feet and muscles such as were possible in the ascent that he did not attempt it He launched outward and down in one magnificent and love heroic leap He knew that he was violating a taboo of life just as he knew he was violating a taboo if he sprang into Meringe Lagoon where swam the dreadful crocodiles Great love is always capable of expressing itself in sacrifice and self immolation And only for love and for no lesser reason could Jerry have made the leap He struck on his side and head The one impact knocked the breath out of him the other stunned him Even in his unconsciousness lying on his side and quivering he made rapid spasmodic movements of his legs as if running for ard to Skipper The boys looked on and laughed and when he no longer quivered and churned his legs they continued to laugh Born in savagery having lived in savagery all their lives and known naught else their sense of humour was correspondingly savage To them the sight of a stunned and possibly dead puppy was a side splitting ludicrous event Not until the fourth minute ticked off did returning consciousness enable Jerry to crawl to his feet and with wide spread legs and swimming eyes adjust himself to the Arangi s roll Yet with the first glimmerings of consciousness persisted the one idea that he must gain to Skipper Blacks In his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count He ignored the chuckling grinning girding black boys who but for the fact that he was under the terrible aegis of the big fella white marster would have delighted to kill and eat the puppy who in the process of training was proving a most capable nigger chaser Without a turn of head or roll of eye aristocratically positing their non existingness to their faces he trotted for ard along the cabin floor and into the stateroom where Skipper babbled maniacally in the bunk Jerry who had never had malaria did not understand But in his heart he knew great trouble in that Skipper was in trouble Skipper did not recognize him even when he sprang into the bunk walked across Skipper s heaving chest and licked the acrid sweat of fever from Skipper s face Instead Skipper s wildly thrashing arms brushed him away and flung him violently against the side of the bunk This was roughness that was not love roughness Nor was it the roughness of Borckman spurning him away with his foot It was part of Skipper s trouble Jerry did not reason this conclusion But and to the point he acted upon it as if he had reasoned it In truth through inadequacy of one of the most adequate languages in the world it can only be said that Jerry sensed the new difference of this roughness He sat up just out of range of one restless beating arm yearned to come closer and lick again the face of the god who knew him not and who he knew loved him well and palpitatingly shared and suffered all Skipper s trouble Eh Clancey Skipper babbled It s a fine job this day and no better crew to clean up after the dubs of motormen Number three jack Clancey Get under the for ard end And as the spectres of his nightmare metamorphosed Hush darling talking to your dad like that telling him the combing of your sweet and golden hair As if I couldn t that have combed it these seven years better than your mother darling better than your mother I m the one gold medal prize winner in the combing of his lovely daughter s lovely hair She s broken out Give her the wheel aft there Jib and fore topsail halyards Full and by there A good full Ah she takes it like the beauty fairy boat that she is upon the sea I ll just lift that sure the limit Blackey when you pay as much to see my cards as I m going to pay to see yours you re going to see some cards believe me And so the farrago of unrelated memories continued to rise vocal on Skipper s lips to the heave of his body and the beat of his arms while Jerry crouched against the side of the bunk mourned and mourned his grief and inability to be of help All that was occurring was beyond him He knew no more of poker hands than did he know of getting ships under way of clearing up surface car wrecks in New York or of combing the long yellow hair of a loved daughter in a Harlem flat Both dead Skipper said in a change of delirium He said it quietly as if announcing the time of day then wailed But oh the bonnie bonnie braids of all the golden hair of her He lay motionlessly for a space and sobbed out a breaking heart This was Jerry s chance He crept inside the arm that tossed snuggled against Skipper s side laid his head on Skipper s shoulder his cool nose barely touching Skipper s cheek and felt the arm curl about him and press him closer The hand bent from the wrist and caressed him protectingly and the warm contact of his velvet body put a change in Skipper s sick dreams for he began to mutter in cold and bitter
