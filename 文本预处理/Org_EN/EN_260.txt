But Corliss did go back to see her and before the day was out A little bitter self communion had not taken long to show him his childishness The sting of loss was hard enough but the thought now they could be nothing to each other that her last impressions of him should be bad hurt almost as much and in a way even more And further putting all to the side he was really ashamed He had thought that he could have taken such a disappointment more manfully especially since in advance he had not been at all sure of his footing So he called upon her walked with her up to the Barracks and on the way with her help managed to soften the awkwardness which the morning had left between them He talked reasonably and meekly which she countenanced and would have apologized roundly had she not prevented him Not the slightest bit of blame attaches to you she said Had I been in your place I should probably have done the same and behaved much more outrageously For you were outrageous you know But had you been in my place and I in yours he answered with a weak attempt at humor there would have been no need She smiled glad that he was feeling less strongly about it But unhappily our social wisdom does not permit such a reversal he added more with a desire to be saying something Ah she laughed There s where my Jesuitism comes in I can rise above our social wisdom You don t mean to say that There shocked as usual No I could not be so crude as to speak outright but I might finesse as you whist players say Accomplish the same end only with greater delicacy After all a distinction without a difference Could you he asked I know I could if the occasion demanded I am not one to let what I might deem life happiness slip from me without a struggle That judicially occurs only in books and among sentimentalists As my father always says I belong to the strugglers and fighters That which appeared to me great and sacred that would I battle for though I brought heaven tumbling about my ears You have made me very happy Vance she said at parting by the Barracks gates And things shall go along in the same old way And mind not a bit less of you than formerly but rather much more But Corliss after several perfunctory visits forgot the way which led to Jacob Welse s home and applied himself savagely to his work He even had the hypocrisy at times to felicitate himself upon his escape and to draw bleak fireside pictures of the dismal future which would have been had he and Frona incompatibly mated But this was only at times As a rule the thought of her made him hungry in a way akin to physical hunger and the one thing he found to overcome it was hard work and plenty of it But even then what of trail and creek and camp and survey he could only get away from her in his waking hours In his sleep he was ignobly conquered and Del Bishop who was with him much studied his restlessness and gave a ready ear to his mumbled words The pocket miner put two and two together and made a correct induction from the different little things which came under his notice But this did not require any great astuteness The simple fact that he no longer called on Frona was sufficient evidence of an unprospering suit But Del went a step farther and drew the corollary that St Vincent was the cause of it all Several times he had seen the correspondent with Frona going one place and another and was duly incensed thereat I ll fix m yet he muttered in camp one evening over on Gold Bottom Whom Corliss queried Who That newspaper man that s who What for Aw general principles Why n t you let me paste m that night at the Opera House Corliss laughed at the recollection Why did you strike him Del General principles Del snapped back and shut up But Del Bishop for all his punitive spirit did not neglect the main chance and on the return trip when they came to the forks of Eldorado and Bonanza he called a halt Say Corliss he began at once d you know what a hunch is His employer nodded his comprehension Well I ve got one I ain t never asked favors of you before but this once I want you to lay over here till to morrow Seems to me my fruit ranch is most in sight I can damn near smell the oranges a ripenin Certainly Corliss agreed But better still I ll run on down to Dawson and you can come in when you ve finished hunching Say Del objected I said it was a hunch and I want to ring you in on it savve You re all right and you ve learned a hell of a lot out of books You re a regular high roller when it comes to the laboratory and all that but it takes yours truly to get down and read the face of nature without spectacles Now I ve got a theory Corliss threw up his hands in affected dismay and the pocket miner began to grow angry That s right Laugh But it s built right up on your own pet theory of erosion and changed riverbeds And I didn t pocket among the Mexicans two years for nothin Where d you s pose this Eldorado gold came from rough and no signs of washin Eh There s where you need your spectacles Books have made you short sighted But never mind how Tisn t exactly pockets neither but I know what I m spelling about I ain t been keepin tab on traces for my health I can tell you mining sharps more about the lay of Eldorado Creek in one minute than you could figure out in a month of Sundays But never mind no offence You lay over with me till to morrow and you can buy a ranch longside of mine sure Well all right I can rest up and look over my notes while you re hunting your ancient river bed Didn t I tell you it was a hunch Del reproachfully demanded And haven t I agreed to stop over What more do you want To give you a fruit ranch that s what Just to go with me and nose round a bit that s all I do not want any of your impossible fruit ranches I m tired and worried can t you leave me alone I think I am more than fair when I humor you to the extent of stopping over You may waste your time nosing around but I shall stay in camp Understand Burn my body but you re grateful By the Jumpin Methuselah I ll quit my job in two minutes if you don t fire me Me a layin wake nights and workin up my theory and calculatin on lettin you in and you a snorin and Frona this and Frona that That ll do Stop it The hell it will If I didn t know more about gold mining than you do about courtin Corliss sprang at him but Del dodged to one side and put up his fists Then he ducked a wild right and left swing and side stepped his way into firmer footing on the hard trail Hold on a moment he cried as Corliss made to come at him again Just a second If I lick you will you come up the hillside with me Yes And if I don t you can fire me That s fair Come on Vance had no show whatever as Del well knew who played with him feinting attacking retreating dazzling and disappearing every now and again out of his field of vision in a most exasperating way As Vance speedily discovered he possessed very little correlation between mind and body and the next thing he discovered was that he was lying in the snow and slowly coming back to his senses How how did you do it he stammered to the pocket miner who had his head on his knee and was rubbing his forehead with snow Oh you ll do Del laughed helping him limply to his feet You re the right stuff I ll show you some time You ve got lots to learn yet what you won t find in books But not now We ve got to wade in and make camp then you re comin up the hill with me Hee hee he chuckled later as they fitted the pipe of the Yukon stove Slow sighted and short Couldn t follow me eh But I ll show you some time oh I ll show you all right all right Grab an axe an come on he commanded when the camp was completed He led the way up Eldorado borrowed a pick shovel and pan at a cabin and headed up among the benches near the mouth of French Creek Vance though feeling somewhat sore was laughing at himself by this time and enjoying the situation He exaggerated the humility with which he walked at the heel of his conqueror while the extravagant servility which marked his obedience to his hired man made that individual grin You ll do You ve got the makin s in you Del threw down the tools and scanned the run of the snow surface carefully Here take the axe shinny up the hill and lug me down some skookum dry wood By the time Corliss returned with the last load of wood the pocket miner had cleared away the snow and moss in divers spots and formed in general design a rude cross Cuttin her both ways he explained Mebbe I ll hit her here or over there or up above but if there s anything in the hunch this is the place Bedrock dips in above and it s deep there and most likely richer but too much work This is the rim of the bench Can t be more n a couple of feet down All we want is indications afterwards we can tap in from the side As he talked he started fires here and there on the uncovered spaces But look here Corliss I want you to mind this ain t pocketin This is just plain ordinary prentice work but pocketin he straightened up his back and spoke reverently but pocketin is the deepest science and the finest art Delicate to a hair s breadth hand and eye true and steady as steel When you ve got to burn your pan blue black twice a day and out of a shovelful of gravel wash down to the one wee speck of flour gold why that s washin that s what it is Tell you what I d sooner follow a pocket than eat And you would sooner fight than do either Bishop stopped to consider He weighed himself with care equal to that of retaining the one wee speck of flour gold No I wouldn t neither I d take pocketin in mine every time It s as bad as dope Corliss sure If it once gets a hold of you you re a goner You ll never shake it Look at me And talk about pipe dreams they can t burn a candle longside of it He walked over and kicked one of the fires apart Then he lifted the pick and the steel point drove in and stopped with a metallic clang as though brought up by solid cement Ain t thawed two inches he muttered stooping down and groping with his fingers in the wet muck The blades of last year s grass had been burned away but he managed to gather up and tear away a handful of the roots Hell What s the matter Corliss asked Hell he repeated in a passionless way knocking the dirt covered roots against the pan Corliss went over and stooped to closer inspection Hold on he cried picking up two or three grimy bits of dirt and rubbing them with his fingers A bright yellow flashed forth Hell the pocket miner reiterated tonelessly First rattle out the box Begins at the grass roots and goes all the way down Head turned to the side and up eyes closed nostrils distended and quivering he rose suddenly to his feet and sniffed the air Corliss looked up wonderingly Huh the pocket miner grunted Then he
