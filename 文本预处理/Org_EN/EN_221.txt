Take me back Take me to the place you brought me from I cried to the stooping figure The others had come up The chauffeur was vague and mumbling He was drunk enough to be stubborn cautious But money quickened him He had picked me up he said in one of the streets he couldn t say positively which and he mentioned several It might be any one of them but it wasn t far from St John s Wood Station In spite of the man s condition I wanted to get into his cab I had a horror of losing him I have taken his number the Healer said as though that were enough And all the while But we are coming Betty Coming The other driver had been summoned I heard the names of streets and of police stations They settled which would be the one Will you drive very fast I asked I[Pg ] will give you all I have if you ll drive fast The drunken chauffeur followed us in his swerving rocking cab I leaned out of the window all the way weeping praying And I never took my eyes away from the only clue Minutes and minutes went by I seemed to have spent my life hanging out of a taxi window watching a drunken driver steer his uneven course He ran up on a curbstone and the cab tilted Then it righted and came on at a terrific pace almost to capsize again as it turned the abrupt corner which we ourselves had rounded just before we stopped I looked up and saw a light burning in a lantern above an open door The room we went into was smaller than the one at Alton Street And Betty wasn t there Only one man standing at a high desk An honest looking fresh coloured man but quite young When the others began telling him why we had come I broke in This is not an ordinary thing We must see the inspector The young man said he was the inspector Among us we told him [Pg ] The drunken cabman almost sober spoke quite differently Sensible alert Now something would be done I no longer regretted the youth of the inspector This man was human You will bring the List and come with us at once I was told he could not come An inspector must stay at his post An inspector s post was the station But I clung to the hope he had inspired What had he turned away for with that brisk air My eyes went on before him looking for the telephone he must be going to use or an electric bell that should sound some great alarum summoning a legion of police He had come back he stood before us holding in his hand a piece of yellow paper Precisely such a piece of paper as that on which already there in Alton Street the miserable story was set down I shall not be believed but this man too began to write on the glazed surface with a stump of blunt lead pencil Don t wait to write it all again I prayed Telephone for help But he too made little of the need for haste [Pg ] He too made much of what I had noticed as we left Victoria the homely woman and the policeman watching as we drove away You think Mrs Harborough said that the woman was suspicious No doubt and no doubt the policeman was suspicious too The inspector spoke with pride Oh we get to know those people They meet the trains They re at the docks when ships come in It was then I saw that Mrs Harborough could be stirred too If the policeman knew she said if he so much as suspected why did he not stop the motor The inspector shook his head Why didn t he arrest the woman He is not allowed said the inspector I was sure he couldn t be telling us the truth A creeping despair came over me My first impression had been right This man was too young too ignorant to help in such appalling trouble as ours He was speaking kindly still I might be sure they would do all they could to discover the house When When [Pg ] And if they did discover it he said they would watch it Watch it I could not think I had heard right You don t mean stand outside and wait while all the time inside They tried to make me calmer The inspector said under certain circumstances a warrant could be obtained to search the house And was the warrant ready Everything possible would be done Oh the times they said that Then the inspector a little wearied told Mrs Harborough it might be advisable to go and see the man who is in charge of all these cases Not only I Mrs Harborough heard him For she repeated All these cases You don t mean such a thing has happened before Oh yes the young man said But usually it s poor girls This is the gentleman who has charge of all that He turned and pointed to the left Beyond a board where keys were hanging under two crossed swords the electric light shone clear on the picture of a man in an officer s uniform A man wearing a sword and a cocked hat with plume the sort of dress Lord Helmstone wore when he went to the King s Lev e [Pg ] When is he here Mrs Harborough asked Oh he never comes here He s at Scotland Yard Scotland I cried They told me Scotland Yard was in London Then we ll go to Scotland Yard He wouldn t be at Scotland Yard now He might be there in the morning this man in charge of all such cases The young inspector spoke his superior s name with awe Oh a person very great and powerful and his hand was on his sword I put my empty hands over my face and wept aloud Betty Betty who will help us I did not need their foolish words to realise at last that I should have as much help now when help was any good as much help from the sword in the picture as from this man with three stripes on his sleeve and the blunt lead pencil in his hand Who was there in all the world who really cared A vision of my mother rose to stab at me No other friend Eric as far away as heaven [Pg ] The inspector and the man in leather were lifting me into a cab The electric light was fierce in their faces Then the light and they were gone We were driving in silence through streets of shadow sharply streaked with light I crouched in the corner and fought the flames that shrivelled up my flesh Torment Torment Betty with a hundred faces And every one a separate agony Betty beginning to understand Betty looking for her sister calling out for me No sister No friend Only the fiends of hell Torment Torment I was crying fiercely again and beating with clenched fists I heard a crash The cab was stopped and strange faces crowded I was being held She has lost her mind one said But no it wasn t lost It was serving me with devilish clearness More pictures and still more Well well Betty would die soon Like cool water holy water came the thought of death Perhaps she was already dead Oh my God make it true Let her be dead Here was healing at last Betty was dead chauffeur n v The chauffeur handed the old lady from the car She went out herself and spoke to the chauffeur mumbling mumble I could hear him mumbling to himself He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party when he
